# Apache Arrow Jira -> GitHub Issue Migration Scripts

This repo contains scripts developed to enable migration of issues from ASF Jira to GitHub issues. 
The scripts contain a substantial amount of project-specific code, including mapping specific Jira
fields to corresponding GitHub issue metadata. Many of those project-specific decisions are captured
[here](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3). If there's interest in 
making this work support similar migrations more generally, please raise an issue.
