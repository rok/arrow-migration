Let's take a slightly more in-depth look at the Rust implementation's needs.\n+\n+## Project Structure\n+The Rust implementation of Arrow actually consists of several distinct projects, or in Rust parlance, [\"crates\"][3]. In addition to the Arrow crate that contains core functionality such as the in-memory format and inter-process communication, we also maintain:\n+- [DataFusion][4]: an extensible in-memory query execution engine using Arrow as its format\n+- [Ballista][5]: a distributed compute platform, powered by Apache Arrow and DataFusion\n+\n+Whilst these projects are all closely related, with many shared contributors, they're very much at different stages in their respective lifecycles. The core Arrow crate, as an implementation of a spec, has strict compatibility requirements with other versions of Arrow, and this is tested via rigorous cross-language integration tests.\n+\n+However, at the other end of the spectrum, DataFusion and Ballista are still nascent projects in their own right that undergo frequent backwards-incompatible changes. In the old workflow, DataFusion was released in lockstep with Arrow; because DataFusion users often need newly-contributed features or bugfixes on a tighter schedule than Arrow releases, we observed that many people in the community simply resorted to referencing our GitHub repository directly, rather than properly versioned builds on [crates.io][6], Rust's package registry.\n+\n+Ultimately, the decision was made to split the Rust crates into two separate repositories: [arrow-rs][7] for the core Arrow functionality, and [arrow-datafusion][8] for DataFusion and Ballista. There's still work to be done on determining the exact release workflows for the latter, but this leaves us in a much better position to meet the broader Rust community's expectations of crate versioning and stability.\n+\n+## Community Participation\n+All Apache projects are built on volunteer contribution; it's a core principle of both the ASF and open-source software development more broadly. One point of friction that was observed in the previous workflow for the Rust community in particular was the requirement for issues to be logged in Arrow's Jira project. This step required would-be contributors to first register an account, and then receive a permissions grant to manage tickets.\n+\n+To streamline this process for new community members, we've taken the decision to migrate to GitHub Issues for tracking both new development work and known bugs that need addressing, and bootstrapped our new repositories by importing their respective tickets from Jira. We hope that this strikes a better balance between organisation and accessibility for prospective contributors.\n+\n+## Get Involved\n+To further improve the onboarding flow for new Arrow contributors, we've begun the process of labelling select issues as \"good first issue\" in [arrow-rs][11] and [arrow-datafusion][12]. These issues are typically small in scope, but still serve as valuable contributions to the project, and help acclimatise new community members to our development workflows and tools.\n\nReview comment:\n       ```suggestion\r\n   To further improve the onboarding flow for new Arrow contributors, we have started the process of labeling select issues as \"good first issue\" in [arrow-rs][11] and [arrow-datafusion][12].

If you're considering Rust as a language for working with columnar data, read on and see how your use case might benefit from our new and improved project setup.\n+\n+In recent months, members of the community have been working closely with Arrow's [Project Management Committee][1] and other contributors to expand the set of available workflows for Arrow implementations. The goal was to define a new development process that ultimately:\n+- Enables a faster release cadence\n+- Encourages maximum participation from the wider community\n+- Ensures that we continue to uphold the tenets of [The Apache Way][2]\n+\n+If you're just here for the highlights, the major outcomes of these discussions are as follows:\n+- The Rust projects have moved to separate repositories, outside the main Arrow [monorepo][9]\n+\t- [arrow-rs][7] for the core Arrow implementation in Rust\n+\t- [arrow-datafusion][8] for DataFusion and Ballista (more on these projects below!)\n+- The Rust community will use GitHub Issues for tracking feature development and issues, replacing the Jira instance maintained by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)\n+\n+But why, as a community, have we decided to change our processes? Let's take a slightly more in-depth look at the Rust implementation's needs.\n+\n+## Project Structure\n+The Rust implementation of Arrow actually consists of several distinct projects, or in Rust parlance, [\"crates\"][3]. In addition to the Arrow crate that contains core functionality such as the in-memory format and inter-process communication, we also maintain:\n+- [DataFusion][4]: an extensible in-memory query execution engine using Arrow as its format\n+- [Ballista][5]: a distributed compute platform, powered by Apache Arrow and DataFusion\n+\n+Whilst these projects are all closely related, with many shared contributors, they're very much at different stages in their respective lifecycles. The core Arrow crate, as an implementation of a spec, has strict compatibility requirements with other versions of Arrow, and this is tested via rigorous cross-language integration tests.\n+\n+However, at the other end of the spectrum, DataFusion and Ballista are still nascent projects in their own right that undergo frequent backwards-incompatible changes. In the old workflow, DataFusion was released in lockstep with Arrow; because DataFusion users often need newly-contributed features or bugfixes on a tighter schedule than Arrow releases, we observed that many people in the community simply resorted to referencing our GitHub repository directly, rather than properly versioned builds on [crates.io][6], Rust's package registry.\n+\n+Ultimately, the decision was made to split the Rust crates into two separate repositories: [arrow-rs][7] for the core Arrow functionality, and [arrow-datafusion][8] for DataFusion and Ballista. There's still work to be done on determining the exact release workflows for the latter, but this leaves us in a much better position to meet the broader Rust community's expectations of crate versioning and stability.\n+\n+## Community Participation\n+All Apache projects are built on volunteer contribution; it's a core principle of both the ASF and open-source software development more broadly. One point of friction that was observed in the previous workflow for the Rust community in particular was the requirement for issues to be logged in Arrow's Jira project. This step required would-be contributors to first register an account, and then receive a permissions grant to manage tickets.\n+\n+To streamline this process for new community members, we've taken the decision to migrate to GitHub Issues for tracking both new development work and known bugs that need addressing, and bootstrapped our new repositories by importing their respective tickets from Jira. We hope that this strikes a better balance between organisation and accessibility for prospective contributors.\n+\n+## Get Involved\n+To further improve the onboarding flow for new Arrow contributors, we've begun the process of labelling select issues as \"good first issue\" in [arrow-rs][11] and [arrow-datafusion][12]. These issues are typically small in scope, but still serve as valuable contributions to the project, and help acclimatise new community members to our development workflows and tools.\n\nReview comment:\n       Ah, the old single vs double L, a classic in English dialect wars! Lemme scan through the blog post history, I'll standardise (heh, I'm picking a side already with that S) on either British or American English depending on which is more common. There's probably other bits that need unifying if so.\r\n   \r\n   I'll try and incorporate these suggestions in some fashion, clarity is always a good goal \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

In addition to the Arrow crate that contains core functionality such as the in-memory format and inter-process communication, we also maintain:\n+- [DataFusion][4]: an extensible in-memory query execution engine using Arrow as its format\n+- [Ballista][5]: a distributed compute platform, powered by Apache Arrow and DataFusion\n\nReview comment:\n       We have more than 3 crates; within `arrow-rs` we have 4 or 5.

If you're considering Rust as a language for working with columnar data, read on and see how your use case might benefit from our new and improved project setup.\n+\n+In recent months, members of the community have been working closely with Arrow's [Project Management Committee][1] and other contributors to expand the set of available workflows for Arrow implementations. The goal was to define a new development process that ultimately:\n+- Enables a faster release cadence that adheres to [SemVer][15] where appropriate\n+- Encourages maximum participation from the wider community with unified tooling\n+- Ensures that we continue to uphold the tenets of [The Apache Way][2]\n+\n+If you're just here for the highlights, the major outcomes of these discussions are as follows:\n+- The Rust projects have moved to separate repositories, outside the main Arrow [monorepo][9]\n\nReview comment:\n       I was trying to avoid repeating the word repository too often - difficult in a post on dev and release workflows, admittedly \ud83d\ude05 \n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

In the old workflow, DataFusion was released in lockstep with Arrow; because DataFusion users often need newly-contributed features or bugfixes on a tighter schedule than Arrow releases, we observed that many people in the community simply resorted to referencing our GitHub repository directly, rather than properly versioned builds on [crates.io][6], Rust's package registry.\n+\n+Ultimately, the decision was made to split the Rust crates into two separate repositories: [arrow-rs][7] for the core Arrow functionality, and [arrow-datafusion][8] for DataFusion and Ballista.

One point of friction that was observed in the previous workflow for the Rust community in particular was the requirement for issues to be logged in Arrow's Jira project. This step required would-be contributors to first register an account, and then receive a permissions grant to manage tickets.\n+\n+To streamline this process for new community members, we've taken the decision to migrate to GitHub Issues for tracking both new development work and known bugs that need addressing, and bootstrapped our new repositories by importing their respective tickets from Jira.
