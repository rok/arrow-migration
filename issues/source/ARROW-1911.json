Reviews reveal some open questions: \r\n   \r\n   * About: Remove or rewrite? I recommend trimming the Arrow specific bits to one paragraph and using the second paragraph to summarize key details about the JS impl. This will help JS folks who need a brief overview of Arrow + JS Impl, and can choose whether to keep reading on about JS or pause to learn more about Arrow.\r\n   \r\n   * Whether to list contributors + organizations: I'm on the side of being encouraging, especially while it's the early days, so listing contributors. Likewise, Apache Spark allows contributors to list their affiliation (I assume opt-in), so not sure why it'd be different here.\r\n   \r\n   * Whether to include JS social proof on the JS page: I lean towards that b/c it's relevant information and,  given readme length, this is an unsurprising (vs buried) location.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
