Via **GitHub Search** in the Arrow repository (not a forked one)\n+   This way is great as GitHub lets you search for function\n+   definitions and references also.\n+\n+#. **IDE** of your choice.\n+\n+**Binding**\n+\n+Binding means that the function in the C++ is connected from \n+other languages (C (Glib), MATLAB, Python, R or Ruby). Once a \n+function is defined in the C++ we connect it from other languages\n+so that it can be used there also.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\tThere is much you can learn with checking **Pull Requests**\n+\tand **unit tests for similar issues**.  \n+\n+.. tabs::\n+\n+   .. tab:: Python\n+\n+      **Adding a fix in Python**\n+\n+      If you are doing a correction of an existing function, the\n+      easiest way is to run Python interactively or run Jupyter\n+      Notebook from the Python folder in Arrow and research\n\nReview comment:\n       ```suggestion\r\n         easiest way is to run Python interactively or run Jupyter\r\n         Notebook and research\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   What's the reason you would run it specifically from that directory?\n\n##########\nFile path: docs/source/developers/guide/step_by_step/arrow_codebase.rst\n##########\n@@ -0,0 +1,154 @@\n+..

For example:\n+\n+- The ``python/`` folder includes ``pyarrow/`` folder which contains\n+  the code for the pyarrow package and requirements files that you\n+  need when building pyarrow.\n+\n+  The ``pyarrow/`` includes Python and Cython code.\n+\n+  The ``pyarrow/`` also includes ``test/`` folder where all the tests\n+  for the pyarrow modules are located.\n+\n+- The ``R/`` folder holds the code and the documentation for the R package.\n+\n+  The documentation can be found in ``vignettes/`` and in ``R/`` folder\n+  you can find the reference documentation.\n+\n+  The ``R/`` folder also includes tests for the R package\n+  in ``tests/`` and ``extra-tests/``.\n+\n+Other subdirectories included in the arrow repository are:\n+\n+- ``ci/`` contains code connected to the continuous integration work.\n+- ``dev/`` contains scripts useful to developers when packaging,\n+  testing, or committing to Arrow.\n\nReview comment:\n       ```suggestion\r\n   - ``ci/`` contains scripts used by the various CI jobs.\r\n   - ``dev/`` contains scripts useful to developers when packaging,\r\n     testing, or committing to Arrow, as well as definitions for on-demand CI tasks.\r\n   - ``.github/`` contains workflows run on GitHub CI, triggered by certain actions\r\n    such as opening a PR\r\n   ```\r\n   \n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: github-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
