The `arrow` package provides an R interface to the Arrow C++ library, including support for working with Parquet and Feather files, as well as lower-level access to Arrow memory and messages.\n+\n+You can install the package from CRAN with\n+\n+```r\n+install.packages(\"arrow\")\n+```\n+\n+On macOS and Windows, installing a binary package from CRAN will handle Arrow\u2019s C++ dependencies for you. On Linux, you\u2019ll need to first install the C++ library. See the [Arrow project installation page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/) for a list of PPAs from which you can obtain it. If you install the `arrow` package from source and the C++ library is not found, the R package functions will notify you that Arrow is not available. Call\n+\n+```r\n+arrow::install_arrow()\n+```\n+\n+for version- and platform-specific guidance on installing the Arrow C++\n+library.\n+\n+## Parquet files\n+\n+This release introduces read and write support for the [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) columnar data file format. Prior to this release, options for accessing Parquet data in R were limited; the most common recommendation was to use Spark. The `arrow` package greatly simplifies this access and lets you go from a Parquet file to a `data.frame` and back easily, without having to set up a database.\n+\n+```r\n+library(arrow)\n+df <- read_parquet(\"path/to/file.parquet\")\n+```\n+\n+This function, along with the other readers in the package, takes an optional `col_select` argument, inspired by the [`vroom`](https://vroom.r-lib.org/reference/vroom.html) package. This argument lets you use the [\"tidyselect\" helper functions](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/select_helpers.html), as you can do in `dplyr::select()`, to specify that you only want to keep certain columns. By narrowing your selection at read time, you can load a `data.frame` with less memory overhead.\n+\n+For example, suppose you had written the `iris` dataset to Parquet. You could read a `data.frame` with only the columns `c(\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\")` by doing\n+\n+```r\n+df <- read_parquet(\"iris.parquet\", col_select = starts_with(\"Sepal\"))\n+```\n+\n+Just as you can read, you can write Parquet files:\n+\n+```r\n+write_parquet(df, \"path/to/different_file.parquet\")\n+```\n+\n+## Feather files\n+\n+This release also includes full support for the Feather file format, providing `read_feather()` and `write_feather()`. [Feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) was one of the initial products coming out of the Arrow project, providing an efficient, common file format language-agnostic data frame storage, along with implementations in R and Python.\n+\n+As Arrow progressed, development of Feather moved to the [`apache/arrow`](https://github.com/apache/arrow) project, and for the last two years, the Python implementation of Feather has just been a wrapper around `pyarrow`. This meant that as Arrow progressed and bugs were fixed, the Python version of Feather got the improvements but sadly R did not.\n+\n+With this release, the R implementation of Feather catches up and now depends on the same underlying C++ library as the Python version does. This should result in more reliable and consistent behavior across the two languages.\n+\n+We encourage all R users of `feather` to switch to using `arrow::read_feather()` and `arrow::write_feather()`.\n+\n+Note that both Feather and Parquet are columnar data formats that allow sharing data frames across R, Pandas, and other tools. When should you use Feather and when should you use Parquet? We currently recommend Parquet for long-term storage, as well as for cases where the size on disk matters because Parquet supports various compression formats. Feather, on the other hand, may be faster to read in because it matches the in-memory format and doesn't require deserialization, and it also allows for memory mapping so that you can access data that is larger than can fit into memory. See the [Arrow project FAQ](https://arrow.apache.org/faq/) for more.\n \n Review comment:\n   I think if you say \"Parquet supports various compression formats\" it might bring up some canards with the R community. It's simpler to say that \"Parquet is optimized to create small files and as a result can be more expensive to read locally, but it performs very well with remote storage like HDFS or Amazon S3. Feather is designed for fast local reads, particularly with solid state drives, and is not intended for use with remote storage systems. Feather files can be memory-mapped and read in Arrow format without any deserialization while Parquet files always must be decompressed and decoded.\" \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

It also provides many lower-level bindings to the C++ library, which enable you to access and manipulate Arrow objects. You can use these to build connectors to other applications and services that use Arrow. One example is Spark: the [`sparklyr`](https://spark.rstudio.com/) package has support for using Arrow to move data to and from Spark, yielding [significant performance gains](http://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/01/25/r-spark-improvements/).\n \n Review comment:\n   To avoid peanuts being hurled from the gallery, you may want to state here that the functions like read_csv_arrow are being developed to optimize for the memory layout of the Arrow columnar format, and are not intended as a replacement for \"native\" functions that return R data.frame, for example. \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

The `arrow` package provides an R interface to the Arrow C++ library, including support for working with Parquet and Feather files, as well as lower-level access to Arrow memory and messages.\n+\n+You can install the package from CRAN with\n+\n+```r\n+install.packages(\"arrow\")\n+```\n+\n+On macOS and Windows, installing a binary package from CRAN will handle Arrow\u2019s C++ dependencies for you. On Linux, you\u2019ll need to first install the C++ library. See the [Arrow project installation page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/) for a list of PPAs from which you can obtain it. If you install the `arrow` package from source and the C++ library is not found, the R package functions will notify you that Arrow is not available. Call\n+\n+```r\n+arrow::install_arrow()\n+```\n+\n+for version- and platform-specific guidance on installing the Arrow C++\n+library.\n+\n+## Parquet files\n+\n+This release introduces read and write support for the [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) columnar data file format. Prior to this release, options for accessing Parquet data in R were limited; the most common recommendation was to use Spark. The `arrow` package greatly simplifies this access and lets you go from a Parquet file to a `data.frame` and back easily, without having to set up a database.\n \n Review comment:\n   I think you need to qualify that this is \"preliminary\" read and write support that is in its early stages of development. Otherwise you're setting the wrong expectations. It would be accurate (and helpful) to state that the Python Arrow library has much richer support for Parquet files, including multi-file datasets, and we hope to achieve feature equivalency in the next 12 months. \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

Prior to this release, options for accessing Parquet data in R were limited; the most common recommendation was to use Spark. The `arrow` package greatly simplifies this access and lets you go from a Parquet file to a `data.frame` and back easily, without having to set up a database.\n+\n+```r\n+library(arrow)\n+df <- read_parquet(\"path/to/file.parquet\")\n+```\n+\n+This function, along with the other readers in the package, takes an optional `col_select` argument, inspired by the [`vroom`](https://vroom.r-lib.org/reference/vroom.html) package. This argument lets you use the [\"tidyselect\" helper functions](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/select_helpers.html), as you can do in `dplyr::select()`, to specify that you only want to keep certain columns. By narrowing your selection at read time, you can load a `data.frame` with less memory overhead.\n+\n+For example, suppose you had written the `iris` dataset to Parquet. You could read a `data.frame` with only the columns `c(\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\")` by doing\n+\n+```r\n+df <- read_parquet(\"iris.parquet\", col_select = starts_with(\"Sepal\"))\n+```\n+\n+Just as you can read, you can write Parquet files:\n+\n+```r\n+write_parquet(df, \"path/to/different_file.parquet\")\n+```\n+\n+## Feather files\n+\n+This release also includes full support for the Feather file format, providing `read_feather()` and `write_feather()`. [Feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) was one of the initial products coming out of the Arrow project, providing an efficient, common file format language-agnostic data frame storage, along with implementations in R and Python.\n \n Review comment:\n   It's accurate to say \"includes a much faster implementation of the Feather file format\"\r\n   \r\n   when you say \"initial products coming out of the Arrow project\" -- it didn't actually. Perhaps say \"was one of the initial applications of Apache Arrow for Python and R\". \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
