It is the\n+product of 2 months of development and includes [**287 resolved\n+issues**][1].\n+\n+See the [Install Page][2] to learn how to get the libraries for your\n+platform. The [complete changelog][3] is also available.\n+\n+We discuss some highlights from the release and other project news in this\n+post.\n+\n+## Arrow Flight RPC and Messaging Framework\n+\n+We are developing a new Arrow-native RPC framework, Arrow Flight, based on\n+[gRPC][11] for high performance Arrow-based messaging. Through low-level\n+extensions to gRPC's internal memory management, we are able to avoid expensive\n+parsing when receiving datasets over the wire, unlocking unprecedented levels\n+of performance in moving datasets from one machine to another. We will be\n+writing more about Flight on the Arrow blog in the future.\n+\n+Prototype implementations are available in Java and C++, and we will be focused\n+in the coming months on hardening the Flight RPC framework for enterprise-grade\n+production use cases.\n+\n+## Parquet and Arrow C++ communities joining forces\n+\n+After discussion over the last year, the Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet C++\n+communities decide to merge the Parquet C++ codebase into the Arrow C++\n+codebase and work together in a \"monorepo\" structure. This should result in\n+better developer productivity in core Parquet work as well as in Arrow\n+integration.\n+\n+Before this codebase merge, we had a circular dependency between the Arrow and\n+Parquet codebases, since the Parquet C++ library is used in the Arrow Python\n+library.\n+\n+## Gandiva LLVM Expression Compiler donation\n+\n+[Dremio Corporation][5] has donated the [Gandiva][6] LLVM expression compiler\n+to Apache Arrow. We will be working on cross-platform builds, packaging, and\n+language bindings (e.g. in Python) for Gandiva in the upcoming 0.12 release and\n+beyond. We will write more about Gandiva in the future.\n+\n+## Parquet C GLib Bindings Donation\n+\n+PMC member [Kouhei Sutou][7] has donated GLib bindings for the Parquet C++\n+libraries, which are designed to work together with the existing Arrow GLib\n+bindings.\n+\n+## C++ CSV Reader Project\n+\n+We have begun developing a general purpose multithreaded CSV file parser in\n+C++. The purpose of this library is to parse and convert comma-separated text\n+files into Arrow columnar record batches as efficiently as possible. The\n+prototype version features Python bindings, and any language that can use the\n+C++ libraries (including C, R, and Ruby).\n+\n+## New MATLAB bindings\n+\n+[The MathWorks][12] has contributed an initial MEX file binding to the Arrow\n+C++ libraries. Initially, it is possible to read Arrow-based Feather files in\n+MATLAB. We are looking forward to seeing more developments for MATLAB users.\n+\n+## R Library in Development\n+\n+The community has begun implementing [R language bindings and interoperability][8]\n+with the Arrow C++ libraries. This will include support for zero-copy shared\n+memory IPC and other tools needed to improve R integration with Apache Spark\n+and more.\n+\n+## Support for CUDA-based GPUs in Python\n+\n+This release includes Python bindings to the Arrow CUDA integration C++\n+library. This work is targeting interoperability with [Numba][9] and the [GPU\n+Open Analytics Initiative][10].\n+\n+## Upcoming Roadmap\n+\n+In the coming months, we will continue to make progress on many fronts, with\n+Gandiva packaging, expanded language support (especially in R), and improved\n+data access (e.g. CSV, Parquet files) in focus.\n+\n+[1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20status%20in%20(Resolved%2C%20Closed)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.11.0\n+[2]: https://arrow.apache.org/install\n+[3]: https://arrow.apache.org/release/0.11.0.html\n+[4]: https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/arrow/arrow-0.11.0/binaries\n+[5]: http://dremio.com\n \n Review comment:\n   https will be better.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

It is the\n+product of 2 months of development and includes [**287 resolved\n+issues**][1].\n+\n+See the [Install Page][2] to learn how to get the libraries for your\n+platform. The [complete changelog][3] is also available.\n+\n+We discuss some highlights from the release and other project news in this\n+post.\n+\n+## Arrow Flight RPC and Messaging Framework\n+\n+We are developing a new Arrow-native RPC framework, Arrow Flight, based on\n+[gRPC][11] for high performance Arrow-based messaging. Through low-level\n+extensions to gRPC's internal memory management, we are able to avoid expensive\n+parsing when receiving datasets over the wire, unlocking unprecedented levels\n+of performance in moving datasets from one machine to another. We will be\n+writing more about Flight on the Arrow blog in the future.\n+\n+Prototype implementations are available in Java and C++, and we will be focused\n+in the coming months on hardening the Flight RPC framework for enterprise-grade\n+production use cases.\n+\n+## Parquet and Arrow C++ communities joining forces\n+\n+After discussion over the last year, the Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet C++\n+communities decide to merge the Parquet C++ codebase into the Arrow C++\n+codebase and work together in a \"monorepo\" structure. This should result in\n+better developer productivity in core Parquet work as well as in Arrow\n+integration.\n+\n+Before this codebase merge, we had a circular dependency between the Arrow and\n+Parquet codebases, since the Parquet C++ library is used in the Arrow Python\n+library.\n+\n+## Gandiva LLVM Expression Compiler donation\n+\n+[Dremio Corporation][5] has donated the [Gandiva][6] LLVM expression compiler\n+to Apache Arrow. We will be working on cross-platform builds, packaging, and\n+language bindings (e.g. in Python) for Gandiva in the upcoming 0.12 release and\n+beyond. We will write more about Gandiva in the future.\n+\n+## Parquet C GLib Bindings Donation\n+\n+PMC member [Kouhei Sutou][7] has donated GLib bindings for the Parquet C++\n+libraries, which are designed to work together with the existing Arrow GLib\n+bindings.\n+\n+## C++ CSV Reader Project\n+\n+We have begun developing a general purpose multithreaded CSV file parser in\n+C++. The purpose of this library is to parse and convert comma-separated text\n+files into Arrow columnar record batches as efficiently as possible. The\n+prototype version features Python bindings, and any language that can use the\n+C++ libraries (including C, R, and Ruby).\n+\n+## New MATLAB bindings\n+\n+[The MathWorks][12] has contributed an initial MEX file binding to the Arrow\n+C++ libraries. Initially, it is possible to read Arrow-based Feather files in\n+MATLAB. We are looking forward to seeing more developments for MATLAB users.\n+\n+## R Library in Development\n+\n+The community has begun implementing [R language bindings and interoperability][8]\n+with the Arrow C++ libraries. This will include support for zero-copy shared\n+memory IPC and other tools needed to improve R integration with Apache Spark\n+and more.\n+\n+## Support for CUDA-based GPUs in Python\n+\n+This release includes Python bindings to the Arrow CUDA integration C++\n+library. This work is targeting interoperability with [Numba][9] and the [GPU\n+Open Analytics Initiative][10].\n+\n+## Upcoming Roadmap\n+\n+In the coming months, we will continue to make progress on many fronts, with\n+Gandiva packaging, expanded language support (especially in R), and improved\n+data access (e.g. CSV, Parquet files) in focus.\n+\n+[1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20status%20in%20(Resolved%2C%20Closed)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.11.0\n+[2]: https://arrow.apache.org/install\n+[3]: https://arrow.apache.org/release/0.11.0.html\n+[4]: https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/arrow/arrow-0.11.0/binaries\n+[5]: http://dremio.com\n+[6]: http://github.com/dremio/gandiva\n \n Review comment:\n   ditto.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
