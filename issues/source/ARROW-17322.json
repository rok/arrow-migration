Identifying the affected component(s) helps new issues\n+get attention from appropriate contributors.\n+\n+* Use the **Component** field to indicate the area of the project that your\n+  issue pertains to (for example \"Python\" or \"C++\").\n+* Also prefix the issue title with the component name in brackets, for example\n+  ``[Python] issue summary`` ; this helps when navigating lists of open issues,\n+  and it also makes our changelogs more readable. Most prefixes are exactly the\n+  same as the **Component** name, with the following exceptions:\n+\n+  * **Component:** Continuous Integration \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [CI]\n+  * **Component:** Developer Tools \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [Dev]\n+  * **Component:** Documentation \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [Docs]\n+\n+.. _affected-version:\n+\n+Identify affected version\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+\n+If you're reporting something that used to work in a previous version\n+but doesn't work in the current release, you can add the **Affects version**\n+field to identify the earliest known version where the bug is observed.\n+For feature requests and other proposals, leave **Affects version** empty as\n+it is not applicable.\n+\n+.. _issue-lifecycle:\n+\n+Issue lifecycle\n+===============\n+\n+Both bug reports and feature requests follow a defined lifecycle.

Issues in this state should be unassigned.\n+* **In progress** - At the time a contributor self-assigns an issue, the status\n+  should be set to In progress by clicking the **Start progress** button. All\n+  issues in this status should have an assignee - unassigned issues will be\n+  set back to a status of Open. Issues remain \"in progress\" until resolved or\n+  closed, including during review of pull requests.\n+* **Resolved** - This is a terminal status indicating action has been taken\n+  on the issue, which is now considered completed. Issues in a resolved status\n+  may have the following resolution codes set:\n+\n+  * Fixed\n+  * Implemented\n+  * Done\n+\n+* **Closed** - Another terminal status, Closed indicates the issue is complete,\n+  but *without* action being taken.

This reuses existing text (just moved), so it's not a \"new\" description. I think it means to indicate that the Arrow project doesn't directly assign work to resources. That may happen for individual companies that employ staff to work on Arrow, and in that sense, the individuals are not \"volunteers\" in that they are paid for the work they do on Arrow, and that work may be directed by the companies for which they work. But even in that case, the company contributions are \"voluntary\" - they choose what work their employees work on, and are not explicitly directed by the project. It's my belief that this is what this text seeks to convey - that the project itself doesn't direct or the work reflected in the issue tracking system.\r\n   \r\n   I'm happy to try to find a better way to frame this, either in this PR, or a subsequent issue.\n\n\n\n",

The PR was merged, but the resolution is \"Resolved\" instead of \"Fixed\".\r\n   \r\n   I've updated this page to direct usage of \"Fixed\" when resolving an issue. I scanned [this list](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20and%20resolution%20!%3D%20Fixed%20and%20status%20%3D%20Resolved%20order%20by%20resolved%20desc) for examples where that's not set, and it seems to mostly be manually-set resolutions, either using a status of \"Resolved\" when it should be more properly be \"Closed\" (e.g., \"Information Provided\" or \"Won't Fix\" resolutions), or because the issue was resolved by work done on a different issue (and the PR referenced the other issue, not the one with the incorrect resolution).\n\n\n\n",

Assigned issues that have not been updated in past 90 days should be reverted to unassigned.\r\n * All issues \"In Progress\" required an assignee. Any unassigned issue in \"In Progress\" status should be reverted to \"Open\" status.\r\n * Expected usage of issue status and resolution fields should be documented.",
