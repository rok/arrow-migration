The content from the contributing existing site could be put under the guide and some info could be merged between the two.\r\n   \r\n   ### Other parts of the guide\r\n   The introduction page will contain links to other parts of the guide:\r\n   * Architectural Overview\r\n   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14279\r\n   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14280\r\n   * Steps in making your first PR\r\n   * PyArrow and R-Arrow Tutorials\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: github-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

But we can reassure you it is\n+not. What we have to do is to take small steps.\n+\n+\n+Why contribute to Arrow?\n+========================\n+There can be various reasons why someone would want to contribute\n+to Arrow and all of them are valid!\n+\n+* You find the project interesting and would like to give it a go,\n+  learn and grow.\n+\n+* You use Arrow in the project you are working on and it would be\n+  great to make some quick fixes by yourself\n+\n+Read more about the project in the :ref:`about_arrow` section.\n+\n+Quick Reference\n+===============\n+\n+Here are the basic steps needed to get set up and contribute to Arrow.\n+This is meant as a checklist and also to have an overall picture.\n+\n+For complete instructions please follow :ref:`step_by_step` - a\n+step-by-step guide or R and Python :ref:`tutorial-index` for an example\n+of adding a basic feature.\n+\n+\n+#. **Install and set up Git, fork the Arrow repository**\n+\n+   See detailed instructions on how to :ref:`set-up` Git and fork the\n+   Arrow repository.\n+\n+#. **Building Arrow**\n+\n+   This can be quite easy or a real blocker. Be prepared to dig through the\n+   additional flags for cmake in the C++ build guide and read the doc carefully\n+   to not miss any suggestions already given there. Anytime you are stuck,\n+   reach out to us via appropriate :ref:`communication` channel.\n+\n+   See detailed instructions on how to :ref:`build-arrow`.\n+ \n+#. **Run the tests**\n+   \n+   Run the tests from a terminal for Python\n+\n+   .. code-block::\n+\n+      $ pytest pyarrow\n+\n+   or R\n+\n+   .. code-block::\n+\n+      $ devtools::test()\n+\n+#. **Find an issue, create a new branch and work on the problem**\n+\n+   **FInding an issue**\n+\n+   Not so easy, we agree.\n+   Read through the :ref:`finding-issues` section to get some ideas.\n+\n+   **Finding your way through the project**\n+\n+   You have an issue, you build Arrow and now you are completely lost. We get you.\n+   It is a complicated project and the first step is the hardest. We wrote some\n\nReview comment:\n       I wonder if we could rephrase this from \"it is a complicated project\" just as it's slightly setting up the expectation that it's going to be hard\n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: github-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

But we can reassure you it is\n+not. What we have to do is to take small steps.\n+\n+\n+Why contribute to Arrow?\n+========================\n+There can be various reasons why someone would want to contribute\n+to Arrow and all of them are valid!\n+\n+* You find the project interesting and would like to give it a go,\n+  learn and grow.\n+\n+* You use Arrow in the project you are working on and it would be\n+  great to make some quick fixes by yourself\n+\n+Read more about the project in the :ref:`about_arrow` section.\n+\n+Quick Reference\n+===============\n+\n+Here are the basic steps needed to get set up and contribute to Arrow.\n+This is meant as a checklist and also to have an overall picture.\n+\n+For complete instructions please follow :ref:`step_by_step` - a\n+step-by-step guide or R and Python :ref:`tutorial-index` for an example\n+of adding a basic feature.\n+\n+\n+#. **Install and set up Git, fork the Arrow repository**\n+\n+   See detailed instructions on how to :ref:`set-up` Git and fork the\n+   Arrow repository.\n+\n+#. **Building Arrow**\n+\n+   This can be quite easy or a real blocker. Be prepared to dig through the\n+   additional flags for cmake in the C++ build guide and read the doc carefully\n+   to not miss any suggestions already given there. Anytime you are stuck,\n+   reach out to us via appropriate :ref:`communication` channel.\n+\n+   See detailed instructions on how to :ref:`build-arrow`.\n+ \n+#. **Run the tests**\n+   \n+   Run the tests from a terminal for Python\n+\n+   .. code-block::\n+\n+      $ pytest pyarrow\n+\n+   or R\n+\n+   .. code-block::\n+\n+      $ devtools::test()\n+\n+#. **Find an issue, create a new branch and work on the problem**\n+\n+   **FInding an issue**\n+\n+   Not so easy, we agree.\n+   Read through the :ref:`finding-issues` section to get some ideas.\n+\n+   **Finding your way through the project**\n+\n+   You have an issue, you build Arrow and now you are completely lost. We get you.\n+   It is a complicated project and the first step is the hardest.
