DataFusion is an in-memory query engine for the Rust implementation of Apache Arrow.\n+\n+Although DataFusion was started two years ago, it was recently re-implemented to be Arrow-native and currently has limited capabilities but does support SQL queries against iterators of RecordBatch and has support for CSV files. Support for Parquet files will be available soon.\n+\n+SQL support is limited to projection (`SELECT`), selection (`WHERE`), and simple aggregates (`MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`) with support for `GROUP BY`.\n+\n+Supported expressions are identifiers, literals, simple math operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), binary expressions (`AND`, `OR`), equality and comparison operators (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`), and `CAST(expr AS type)`.\n+\n+## Why another query engine?\n+\n+Apache Arrow already has the [Gandiva](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2018/12/05/gandiva-donation/) C++ query engine that was recently donated. Gandiva is both more mature and more advanced than DataFusion but it is not yet possible to call Gandiva from Rust.

There is still an issue with the instructions for publishing the web site though. I think it is assumed that some previous step has happened (perhaps building the C++ implementation?).\r\n   \r\n   When I follow the instructions I get errors for missing IPC / format / layout markdown files, even after running the script that is supposed to copy them to the correct location.\r\n   \r\n   I'll take a look in the morning and see if I can figure this out.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
