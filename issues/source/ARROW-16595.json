Being written in Rust means DataFusion can offer *both* the safety of dynamic languages and \n+the resource efficiency of a compiled language.\n+\n+The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the DataFusion 8.0.0 release (and also the release of version 0.7.0 of \n+the Ballista subproject). This covers 3 months of development work and includes 279 commits from the following 49 \n+distinct contributors.\n+\n+<!--\n+$ git log --pretty=oneline 7.0.0..8.0.0 datafusion datafusion-cli datafusion-examples ballista ballista-cli ballista-examples | wc -l\n+279\n+\n+$ git shortlog -sn 7.0.0..8.0.0 datafusion datafusion-cli datafusion-examples ballista ballista-cli ballista-examples | wc -l\n+49\n+\n+(feynman han, feynman.h, Feynman Han were assumed to be the same person)\n+-->\n+\n+```\n+    39  Andy Grove\n+    33  Andrew Lamb\n+    21  DuRipeng\n+    20  Yijie Shen\n+    19  Yang Jiang\n+    17  Raphael Taylor-Davies\n+    11  Dan Harris\n+    11  Matthew Turner\n+    11  yahoNanJing\n+     9  dependabot[bot]\n+     8  jakevin\n+     6  Kun Liu\n+     5  Jiayu Liu\n+     4  Dani\u00ebl Heres\n+     4  mingmwang\n+     4  xudong.w\n+     3  Carol (Nichols || Goulding)\n+     3  Dmitry Patsura\n+     3  Eduard Karacharov\n+     3  Jeremy Dyer\n+     3  Kaushik\n+     3  Rich\n+     3  comphead\n+     3  gaojun2048\n+     3  Feynman Han\n+     2  Jie Han\n+     2  Jon Mease\n+     2  Tim Van Wassenhove\n+     2  Yt\n+     2  Zhang Li\n+     2  silence-coding\n+     1  Alexander Spies\n+     1  George Andronchik\n+     1  Guillaume Balaine\n+     1  Hao Xin\n+     1  Jiacai Liu\n+     1  J\u00f6rn Horstmann\n+     1  Liang-Chi Hsieh\n+     1  Max Burke\n+     1  NaincyKumariKnoldus\n+     1  Nga Tran\n+     1  Patrick More\n+     1  Pierre Zemb\n+     1  Remzi Yang\n+     1  Sergey Melnychuk\n+     1  Stephen Carman\n+     1  doki\n+```\n+\n+The following section highlights some of the improvements in this release. Of course, many other bug fixes and \n+improvements have also been made and we refer you to the complete \n+[changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/8.0.0/datafusion/CHANGELOG.md) for full details.\n+\n+# Summary\n+\n+## DDL Support\n+\n+DDL support has been expanded to include the following commands for creating databases, schemas, and views. This \n+allows DataFusion to be used more effectively from the CLI.\n+\n+- `CREATE DATABASE`\n+- `CREATE VIEW`\n+- `CREATE SCHEMA`\n+- `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` now supports JSON files, `IF NOT EXISTS`, and partition columns\n+\n+## SQL Query Planner\n+\n+The SQL query planner now supports a number of new SQL features, including support for `IN`, `EXISTS`, and scalar \n+subquery expressions, and support for advanced aggregates with `CUBE` and `ROLLUP` grouping sets. There are also many \n+bug fixes around normalizing identifiers consistently. Note that the physical plan does not yet support all of the \n+new features but these changes make DataFusion more compelling for projects looking for a SQL parser and query \n+planner to translate to their own execution engines.\n+\n+## Query Execution & Internals\n+\n+Here are some of the improvements and new features in the query execution engine:\n+\n+- The `ExecutionContext` has been renamed to `SessionContext` and now supports multi-tenancy\n+- The `ExecutionPlan` trait is no longer async\n+- There is a work-in-progress new Morsel-Driven Scheduler based on the [\"Morsel-Driven Parallelism: A NUMA-Aware Query\n+  Evaluation Framework for the Many-Core Age\"](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/p743-leis.pdf) whitepaper\n+- There is a new sort-merge join operator\n+- There is a new JIT code generation crate. This is not yet integrated into the physical plans\n+- There is a new serialization API for serializing plans to bytes (based on protobuf)\n+\n+## Improved file support\n+\n+DataFusion now supports JSON, both for reading and writing. There are also new DataFrame methods for writing query \n+results to files in CSV, Parquet, and JSON format.\n\nReview Comment:\n   ```suggestion\r\n   ## Improved DataType support\r\n   The `DECIMAL` type is now supported in most operations, and the support for Map and Struct fields is significantly improved\r\n   \r\n   \r\n   ## Improved File Support\r\n   \r\n   DataFusion now supports JSON, both for reading and writing.

Being written in Rust means DataFusion can offer *both* the safety of dynamic languages and \n+the resource efficiency of a compiled language.\n+\n+The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the DataFusion 8.0.0 release (and also the release of version 0.7.0 of \n+the Ballista subproject). This covers 3 months of development work and includes 279 commits from the following 49 \n+distinct contributors.\n+\n+<!--\n+$ git log --pretty=oneline 7.0.0..8.0.0 datafusion datafusion-cli datafusion-examples ballista ballista-cli ballista-examples | wc -l\n+279\n+\n+$ git shortlog -sn 7.0.0..8.0.0 datafusion datafusion-cli datafusion-examples ballista ballista-cli ballista-examples | wc -l\n+49\n+\n+(feynman han, feynman.h, Feynman Han were assumed to be the same person)\n+-->\n+\n+```\n+    39  Andy Grove\n+    33  Andrew Lamb\n+    21  DuRipeng\n+    20  Yijie Shen\n+    19  Yang Jiang\n+    17  Raphael Taylor-Davies\n+    11  Dan Harris\n+    11  Matthew Turner\n+    11  yahoNanJing\n+     9  dependabot[bot]\n+     8  jakevin\n+     6  Kun Liu\n+     5  Jiayu Liu\n+     4  Dani\u00ebl Heres\n+     4  mingmwang\n+     4  xudong.w\n+     3  Carol (Nichols || Goulding)\n+     3  Dmitry Patsura\n+     3  Eduard Karacharov\n+     3  Jeremy Dyer\n+     3  Kaushik\n+     3  Rich\n+     3  comphead\n+     3  gaojun2048\n+     3  Feynman Han\n+     2  Jie Han\n+     2  Jon Mease\n+     2  Tim Van Wassenhove\n+     2  Yt\n+     2  Zhang Li\n+     2  silence-coding\n+     1  Alexander Spies\n+     1  George Andronchik\n+     1  Guillaume Balaine\n+     1  Hao Xin\n+     1  Jiacai Liu\n+     1  J\u00f6rn Horstmann\n+     1  Liang-Chi Hsieh\n+     1  Max Burke\n+     1  NaincyKumariKnoldus\n+     1  Nga Tran\n+     1  Patrick More\n+     1  Pierre Zemb\n+     1  Remzi Yang\n+     1  Sergey Melnychuk\n+     1  Stephen Carman\n+     1  doki\n+```\n+\n+The following section highlights some of the improvements in this release.

This\n+allows DataFusion to be used more effectively from the CLI.\n+\n+- `CREATE DATABASE`\n+- `CREATE VIEW`\n+- `CREATE SCHEMA`\n+- `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` now supports JSON files, `IF NOT EXISTS`, and partition columns\n+\n+## SQL Support\n+\n+The SQL query planner now supports a number of new SQL features, including:\n+\n+- _Subqueries_: when used via `IN`, `EXISTS`, and as scalars\n+- _Grouping Sets_: `CUBE` and `ROLLUP` grouping sets.\n+- _Aggregate functions_: `approx_percentile`, `approx_percentile_cont`, `approx_percentile_cont_with_weight`, `approx_distinct`, `approx_median` and `array`\n+- _`null` literals_\n+- _bitwise operations_: for example '|'\n+\n+There are also many bug fixes and improvements around normalizing identifiers consistently.\n+\n+We continue our tradition of incrementally releasing support for new\n+features as it is developed. Thus, while the physical plan may not yet\n+support all new features, it gets more complete each release. These\n+changes also make DataFusion an increasingly compelling choice for\n+projects looking for a SQL parser and query planner to translate to\n+their own execution engine.\n+\n+## Query Execution & Internals\n+\n+There are several notable improvements and new features in the query execution engine:\n+\n+- The `ExecutionContext` has been renamed to `SessionContext` and now supports multi-tenancy\n+- The `ExecutionPlan` trait is no longer `async`\n\nReview Comment:\n   \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\n\n",

This\n+  is driven by requests from the increasing number of projects that now depend on DataFusion.\n+- There is ongoing work to implement new optimizer rules to rewrite queries containing subquery expressions as\n+  joins, to support a wider range of queries.\n+- The new scheduler based on morsel-driven execution will continue to evolve in this next release, with work to\n+ refine IO abstractions to improve performance and integration with the new scheduler.\n\nReview Comment:\n   ```suggestion\r\n     refine IO abstractions to improve performance and integration with the new scheduler.\r\n   ```\n\n\n\n",
