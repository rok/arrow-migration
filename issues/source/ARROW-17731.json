This is possible courtesy of a software grant from\n+[Dremio][dremio], who developed and open-sourced this driver\n+implementation, in addition to designing and contributing Flight SQL\n+itself.\n+\n+## Background\n+\n+[Arrow Flight RPC][flight] is a framework for efficient transfer of\n+Arrow data across the network.  While it is flexible and can be used\n+in any type of application, from the beginning, it was designed with\n+an eye towards modern databases and other data systems.  Flight SQL\n+realized that goal by defining how to use Flight RPC as a protocol[^1]\n+for database communications: how a client should talk to a server and\n+execute queries, fetch result sets, and so on.\n+\n+With this new JDBC driver, applications can talk to any database\n+server implementing the Flight SQL protocol using familiar JDBC APIs.\n+Underneath, the driver sends queries to the server via Flight SQL and\n+adapts responses to the JDBC interfaces.\n+\n+Put another way, Flight SQL is a database protocol designed for 1)\n+columnar data and 2) implementation by multiple databases.  Some\n+projects do things like reimplement the Postgres wire protocol to\n+benefit from existing driver implementations.  Flight SQL, on the\n+other hand, provides a protocol that is:\n+\n+1. Columnar, using Arrow data for bulk result sets,\n+2. Designed to be implemented by multiple databases, with C++ and Java\n+   libraries, and\n+3. Designed to be adapted to APIs like JDBC and ODBC.\n+\n+Just columnar data alone can be a [significant speedup][hannes] for\n+analytical use cases.\n+\n+[^1]: Despite the name, Flight SQL is **not** a SQL dialect, nor is it\n+    even tied to SQL itself!\n+\n+## Why JDBC?\n+\n+JDBC offers a row-oriented API which is at odds with Arrow's columnar\n+structure.

However, it is a popular and time-tested choice for many\n+applications.  For example, many business intelligence (BI) tools take\n+advantage of JDBC to interoperate generically with multiple databases.\n+An Arrow-native database may still wish to be accessible to all of\n+this existing software, without having to implement multiple client\n+drivers itself.  Additionally, columnar data transfer alone can be a\n+[significant speedup][hannes] for analytical use cases.\n+\n+This JDBC driver implementation demonstrates the generality of Arrow\n+and Flight SQL, and increases the reach of Arrow-based applications.\n+Additionally, an [ODBC driver implementation][dremio-odbc] based on\n+Flight SQL is also available courtesy of Dremio, though it is not yet\n+part of the Arrow project due to dependency licensing issues.\n+\n+Now, a database can support the vast body of existing code that uses\n+JDBC or ODBC, as well as Arrow-native applications, just by\n+implementing a single wire protocol: Flight SQL.  Some projects\n+instead do things like reimplementing the Postgres wire protocol to\n+benefit from its existing drivers.  But for Arrow-native databases,\n+this gives up the benefits of columnar data.  On the other hand,\n+Flight SQL is:\n+\n+1. Columnar and Arrow-native, using Arrow for result sets to avoid\n+   unnecessary data copies and transformations;\n+2. Designed for implementation by multiple databases, with high-level\n+   C++ and Java libraries and a Protobuf protocol definition; and\n+3. Usable both through APIs like JDBC and ODBC thanks to this software\n+   grant, as well as directly (or via [ADBC][adbc]) for applications\n+   that want columnar data.\n+\n+## Getting Involved\n+\n+The JDBC driver was merged for the Arrow 10.0.0 release, and the\n+[source code][impl] can be found in the Arrow repository.  Once Arrow\n+10.0.0 is released (which is planned for October/November 2022),\n\nReview Comment:\n   Revise this now that the RC is happening? And/or consider holding to publish with the release announcement--\"you can check it out now\" is a better call-to-action than \"someday soon it will be released\"\n\n\n\n",

This is courtesy of a software grant\n+from [Dremio][dremio-arrow], a data lakehouse platform. Contributors\n+from Dremio developed and open-sourced this driver implementation, in\n+addition to designing and contributing Flight SQL itself.\n+\n+Flight SQL is a protocol[^1] for client-server database interactions.\n+It defines how a client should talk to a server and execute queries,\n+fetch result sets, and so on.  Underneath, it builds on [Arrow Flight\n+RPC][flight], a framework for efficient transfer of Arrow data across\n+the network.  While Flight RPC is flexible and can be used in any type\n+of application, from the beginning, it was designed with an eye\n+towards the kinds of use cases that Flight SQL supports.\n+\n+With this new JDBC driver, applications can talk to any database\n+server implementing the Flight SQL protocol using familiar JDBC APIs.\n+Underneath, the driver sends queries to the server via Flight SQL and\n+adapts the Arrow result set to the JDBC interface, so that the\n+database can support JDBC users without implementing additional APIs\n+or its own JDBC driver.\n+\n+[^1]: Despite the name, Flight SQL is **not** a SQL dialect, nor is it\n+    even tied to SQL itself!\n+\n+## Why use JDBC with Flight SQL?\n+\n+JDBC offers a row-oriented API, which is opposite of Arrow's columnar\n+structure.  However, it is a popular and time-tested choice for many\n+applications.  For example, many business intelligence (BI) tools take\n+advantage of JDBC to interoperate generically with multiple databases.\n+An Arrow-native database may still wish to be accessible to all of\n+this existing software, without having to implement multiple client\n+drivers itself.  Additionally, columnar data transfer alone can be a\n+[significant speedup][hannes] for analytical use cases.\n+\n+This JDBC driver implementation demonstrates the generality of Arrow\n+and Flight SQL, and increases the reach of Arrow-based applications.\n+Additionally, an [ODBC driver implementation][dremio-odbc] based on\n+Flight SQL is also available courtesy of Dremio, though it is not yet\n+part of the Arrow project due to dependency licensing issues.\n+\n+Now, a database can support the vast body of existing code that uses\n+JDBC or ODBC, as well as Arrow-native applications, just by\n+implementing a single wire protocol: Flight SQL.  Some projects\n+instead do things like reimplementing the Postgres wire protocol to\n+benefit from its existing drivers.  But for Arrow-native databases,\n+this gives up the benefits of columnar data.  On the other hand,\n+Flight SQL is:\n+\n+1. Columnar and Arrow-native, using Arrow for result sets to avoid\n+   unnecessary data copies and transformations;\n+2. Designed for implementation by multiple databases, with high-level\n+   C++ and Java libraries and a Protobuf protocol definition; and\n+3. Usable both through APIs like JDBC and ODBC thanks to this software\n+   grant, as well as directly (or via [ADBC][adbc]) for applications\n+   that want columnar data.\n+\n+## Getting Involved\n+\n+The JDBC driver was merged for the Arrow 10.0.0 release, and the\n+[source code][impl] can be found in the Arrow repository.  Once Arrow\n+10.0.0 is released (which is planned for October/November 2022),\n\nReview Comment:\n   Yeah, that makes sense - and we can patch up the release notes afterwards as well.\n\n\n\n",
