Being written in Rust means DataFusion can offer *both* the safety of dynamic languages as well as the resource efficiency of a compiled language.\n+\n+The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the DataFusion 7.0.0 release. This covers 4 months of development work\n+and includes 195 commits from the following 37 distinct contributors.\n+\n+<!--\n+git log --pretty=oneline 5.0.0..6.0.0 datafusion datafusion-cli datafusion-examples | wc -l\n+     134\n+\n+git shortlog -sn 5.0.0..6.0.0 datafusion datafusion-cli datafusion-examples | wc -l\n+      29\n+\n+      Carlos and xudong963 are same individual\n+-->\n+\n+```\n+    44  Andrew Lamb\n+    24  Kun Liu\n+    23  Jiayu Liu\n+    12  xudong.w\n+    11  Yijie Shen\n+     9  Matthew Turner\n+     7  Liang-Chi Hsieh\n+     5  Lin Ma\n+     5  Carlos\n+     4  Stephen Carman\n+     4  James Katz\n+     4  Dmitry Patsura\n+     4  QP Hou\n+     3  dependabot[bot]\n+     3  Remzi Yang\n+     3  Yang\n+     3  ic4y\n+     3  Dani\u00ebl Heres\n+     2  Andy Grove\n+     2  Raphael Taylor-Davies\n+     2  Jason Tianyi Wang\n+     2  Dan Harris\n+     2  Sergey Melnychuk\n+     1  Nitish Tiwari\n+     1  Dom\n+     1  Eduard Karacharov\n+     1  Javier Goday\n+     1  Boaz\n+     1  Marko Mikulicic\n+     1  Max Burke\n+     1  Carol (Nichols || Goulding)\n+     1  Phillip Cloud\n+     1  Rich\n+     1  Toby Hede\n+     1  Will Jones\n+     1  r.4ntix\n+     1  rdettai\n+```\n+\n+The following section highlights some of the improvements in this release.

To start, datafusion-common (the core DataFusion components) and datafusion-expr (DataFusion expressions, functions, and operators) will be split out.  There will be additional splits after the 7.0 release.\n+- Performance Improvements and Optimizations\n+  - Arrow\u2019s dyn scalar kernels are now used which enable more efficient operations on DictionaryArrays [#1685](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1685)\n+  - Switch from std::sync::Mutex to parking_lot::Mutex [#1720](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1720)\n+- New Features\n+  - Better support for limiting resource usage\n+    - MemoryMananger and DiskManager [#1526](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1526)\n+    - Out of core sort [#1526](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1526)\n+    - New metrics\n+      - `Gauge` and `CurrentMemoryUsage` [#1682](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1682)\n+      - `Spill_count` and `spilled_bytes` [#1641](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1641)\n+  - New math functions\n+    - `Approx_quantile` [#1529](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1539)\n+    - `stddev` and `variance` (sample and population) [#1525](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1525)\n+    - `corr` [#1561](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1561)\n+  - Support decimal type [#1394](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1394)[#1407](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1407)[#1408](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1408)[#1431](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1431)[#1483](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1483)[#1554](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1554)[#1640](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1640)\n+  - Support for evolved schemas [#1622](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1622)[#1709](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1709)\n\nReview comment:\n       i think @thinkharderdev concluded the schema merging already worked for CSV and Json files, but I may also misunderstand\n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: commits-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

To start, datafusion-common (the core DataFusion components) and datafusion-expr (DataFusion expressions, functions, and operators) will be split out.  There will be additional splits after the 7.0 release.\n+- Performance Improvements and Optimizations\n+  - Arrow\u2019s dyn scalar kernels are now used which enable more efficient operations on DictionaryArrays [#1685](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1685)\n+  - Switch from std::sync::Mutex to parking_lot::Mutex [#1720](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1720)\n+- New Features\n+  - Better support for limiting resource usage\n+    - MemoryMananger and DiskManager [#1526](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1526)\n+    - Out of core sort [#1526](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1526)\n+    - New metrics\n+      - `Gauge` and `CurrentMemoryUsage` [#1682](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1682)\n+      - `Spill_count` and `spilled_bytes` [#1641](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1641)\n+  - New math functions\n+    - `Approx_quantile` [#1529](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1539)\n+    - `stddev` and `variance` (sample and population) [#1525](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1525)\n+    - `corr` [#1561](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1561)\n+  - Support decimal type [#1394](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1394)[#1407](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1407)[#1408](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1408)[#1431](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1431)[#1483](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1483)[#1554](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1554)[#1640](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1640)\n+  - Support for evolved schemas [#1622](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1622)[#1709](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1709)\n\nReview comment:\n       i think @thinkharderdev concluded the schema merging already worked for CSV and Json files, but I may also misunderstand\n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: commits-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

To start, datafusion-common (the core DataFusion components) and datafusion-expr (DataFusion expressions, functions, and operators) will be split out.  There will be additional splits after the 7.0 release.\n+- Performance Improvements and Optimizations\n+  - Arrow\u2019s dyn scalar kernels are now used which enable more efficient operations on DictionaryArrays [#1685](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1685)\n+  - Switch from std::sync::Mutex to parking_lot::Mutex [#1720](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1720)\n+- New Features\n+  - Better support for limiting resource usage\n+    - MemoryMananger and DiskManager [#1526](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1526)\n+    - Out of core sort [#1526](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1526)\n+    - New metrics\n+      - `Gauge` and `CurrentMemoryUsage` [#1682](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1682)\n+      - `Spill_count` and `spilled_bytes` [#1641](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1641)\n+  - New math functions\n+    - `Approx_quantile` [#1529](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1539)\n+    - `stddev` and `variance` (sample and population) [#1525](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1525)\n+    - `corr` [#1561](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1561)\n+  - Support decimal type [#1394](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1394)[#1407](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1407)[#1408](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1408)[#1431](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1431)[#1483](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1483)[#1554](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1554)[#1640](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1640)\n+  - Support for evolved schemas [#1622](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1622)[#1709](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/1709)\n\nReview comment:\n       That's right.

Being written in Rust means DataFusion can offer *both* the safety of dynamic languages as well as the resource efficiency of a compiled language.\n+\n+The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the DataFusion 7.0.0 release.
