Could those interested, check the format of the license in `dev/checkstyle.license` and make sure that is what we want to go with?  cc @jacques-n @icexelloss @pravindra \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

This is the current expected format from our checkstyle\r\n    ```\r\n   /**\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n    * or more contributor license agreements.

Saw this a couple times, similar to 1 but one less line and link is indented\r\n   ```\r\n   /*\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n    * contributor license agreements.

This was very common, same as 1 but had <p> instead of empty lines\r\n   ```\r\n   /**\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n    * or more contributor license agreements.

This is the current expected format from our checkstyle\r\n    ```\r\n   /**\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n    * or more contributor license agreements.

Saw this a couple times, similar to 1 but one less line and link is indented\r\n   ```\r\n   /*\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n    * contributor license agreements.

This was very common, same as 1 but had <p> instead of empty lines\r\n   ```\r\n   /**\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n    * or more contributor license agreements.

This is the current expected format from our checkstyle\r\n    ```\r\n   /**\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n    * or more contributor license agreements.

Saw this a couple times, similar to 1 but one less line and link is indented\r\n   ```\r\n   /*\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n    * contributor license agreements.

This was very common, same as 1 but had \\<p\\> instead of empty lines\r\n   ```\r\n   /**\r\n    * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n    * or more contributor license agreements.
