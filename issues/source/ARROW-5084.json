Also, we never did write an announcement about JS 0.4, would it make sense to highlight some of those features here as well?\r\n   \r\n   Here's a blurb about the end of JS-only releases:\r\n   \r\n   # Javascript Notes\r\n   \r\n   0.4.1 will be the last Javascript-only release of Apache Arrow. Starting with 0.13 the Javascript implementation is now included in mainline Arrow releases! The  version number of the released Javascript packages will now be in sync with the mainline version number. \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

This is the\n+covers more than 2 months of development work and includes [**550 resolved\n+issues**][1] from [**81 distinct contributors**][22].\n+\n+See the [Install Page][2] to learn how to get the libraries for your\n+platform. The [complete changelog][3] is also available.\n+\n+While it's a large release, this post will give some brief highlights in the\n+project since the 0.12.0 release from January.\n+\n+## New committer and PMC member\n+\n+The Arrow team is growing! Since the 0.12.0 release we have increased the size\n+of our committer and PMC rosters.\n+\n+* [Andy Grove][13] was promoted to PMC member\n+* [Micah Kornfield][14] was added as a committer\n+\n+Thank you for all your contributions!\n+\n+## Rust DataFusion Query Engine donation\n+\n+Since the last release, we received a donation of [DataFusion][17], a\n+Rust-native query engine for the Arrow columnar format, whose development had\n+been led prior by Andy grove. [Read more about DataFusion][19] in our February\n+blog post.\n+\n+This is an exciting development for the Rust community, and we look forward to\n+developing more analytical query processing within the Apache Arrow project.\n+\n+## Arrow Flight gRPC progress\n+\n+Over the last couple months, we have made significant progress on Arrow Flight,\n+an Arrow-native data messaging framework. We have have integration tests to\n+check C++ and Java compatibility, an we have added Python bindings for the C++\n+library. We will write a future blog post to go into more detail about how\n+Flight works.\n+\n+## C++ notes\n+\n+There were 231 issues relating to C++ in this release, far too much to\n+summarize in a blog post. Some notable items include:\n+\n+* An experimental `ExtensionType` was developed for creating user-defined data\n+  types that can be embedded in the Arrow binary protocol. This is not yet\n+  finalized, but [feedback would be welcome][51].\n+* We have undertaken a significant reworking of our CMake build system for C++\n+  to make the third party dependencies more configurable. Among other things,\n+  this eases work on packaging for Linux distributions. Read more about this in\n+  the [C++ developer documentation][18].\n+* Laying more groundwork for an Arrow-native in-memory query engine\n+* We began building a reader for line-delimited JSON files\n+* Gandiva can now be compiled on Windows with Visual Studio\n+\n+## C# Notes\n+\n+C# .NET development has picked up since the initial code donation last\n+fall. 11 issues were resolved this release cycle.\n+\n+The Arrow C# package is now available via NuGet.\n+\n+## Go notes\n+\n+8 Go-related issues were resolved. A notable feature is the addition of a CSV\n+file writer.\n+\n+## Java notes\n+\n+26 Java issues were resolved. Outside of Flight-related work, some notable\n+items include:\n+\n+* Migration to Java 8 date and time APIs from Joda\n+* Array type support in JDBC adapter\n+\n+## Python notes\n+\n+86 Python-related issues were resolved. Some highlights include:\n+\n+* The Gandiva LLVM expression compiler is now available in the Python wheels\n+  through the ``pyarrow.gandiva`` module.\n+* Flight RPC bindings\n+* Improved pandas serialization performance with RangeIndex\n+* pyarrow can be used without pandas installed\n+\n+Note that Apache Arrow will continue to support Python 2.7 until January 2020.\n+\n+## Ruby and C GLib notes\n+\n+36 C/GLib- and Ruby-related issues were resolved. The work continues to follow\n+the upstream work in the C++ project.\n+\n+## Rust notes\n+\n+69 Rust-related issues were resolved. Many of these relate to ongoing work in\n+the DataFusion query engine. Some notable items include:\n+\n+* Parallel file scans in DataFusion\n+* Prototype DataFrame-style API for DataFusion\n+* Writing CSV files\n+* Continued evolution of Parquet file reader\n+\n+## R development progress\n+\n+The Arrow R developers have expanded the scope of the R language bindings and\n+additionally worked on packaging support to be able to submit the package to\n+CRAN in the near future. 23 issues were resolved for this release.\n+\n+[We wrote in January about ongoing work][50] to accelerate R work on Apache Spark\n+using Arrow.\n+\n+## Community Discussions Ongoing\n+\n+There are a number of active discussions ongoing on the developer\n+``dev@arrow.apache.org`` mailing list. We look forward to hearing from the\n+community there:\n+\n+* **Benchmarking**: we are working to create tools for tracking all of our\n+  benchmark results on a commit-by-commit basis in a centralized database\n+  schema so that we can monitor for performance regressions over time. We hope\n+  to develop a publicly viewable benchmark result dashboard.\n+* **C++ Datasets**: development of a unified API for reading and writing\n+  datasets stored in various common formats like Parquet, JSON, and CSV.\n+* **C++ Query Engine**: architecture of a parallel Arrow-native query engine\n+  for C++\n+* **Arrow Flight Evolution**: adding features to support different real-world\n+  data messaging use cases\n+* **Arrow Columnar Format evolution**: we are discussing a new \"duration\" or\n+  \"time interval\" type and some other additions to the Arrow columnar format.\n+\n+[1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.13.0\n+[2]: https://arrow.apache.org/install\n+[3]: https://arrow.apache.org/release/0.13.0.html\n+[13]: https://github.com/andygrove\n+[14]: https://github.com/emkornfield\n+[17]: http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/arrow-rust-datafusion.html\n+[18]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/cpp.rst#build-dependency-management\n+[19]: http://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/02/04/datafusion-donation/\n+[20]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/util/trie.h\n+[21]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/sparse_tensor.h\n \n Review comment:\n   Unused link.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

This is the\n+covers more than 2 months of development work and includes [**550 resolved\n+issues**][1] from [**81 distinct contributors**][22].\n+\n+See the [Install Page][2] to learn how to get the libraries for your\n+platform. The [complete changelog][3] is also available.\n+\n+While it's a large release, this post will give some brief highlights in the\n+project since the 0.12.0 release from January.\n+\n+## New committer and PMC member\n+\n+The Arrow team is growing! Since the 0.12.0 release we have increased the size\n+of our committer and PMC rosters.\n+\n+* [Andy Grove][13] was promoted to PMC member\n+* [Micah Kornfield][14] was added as a committer\n+\n+Thank you for all your contributions!\n+\n+## Rust DataFusion Query Engine donation\n+\n+Since the last release, we received a donation of [DataFusion][17], a\n+Rust-native query engine for the Arrow columnar format, whose development had\n+been led prior by Andy grove. [Read more about DataFusion][19] in our February\n+blog post.\n+\n+This is an exciting development for the Rust community, and we look forward to\n+developing more analytical query processing within the Apache Arrow project.\n+\n+## Arrow Flight gRPC progress\n+\n+Over the last couple months, we have made significant progress on Arrow Flight,\n+an Arrow-native data messaging framework. We have have integration tests to\n+check C++ and Java compatibility, an we have added Python bindings for the C++\n+library. We will write a future blog post to go into more detail about how\n+Flight works.\n+\n+## C++ notes\n+\n+There were 231 issues relating to C++ in this release, far too much to\n+summarize in a blog post. Some notable items include:\n+\n+* An experimental `ExtensionType` was developed for creating user-defined data\n+  types that can be embedded in the Arrow binary protocol. This is not yet\n+  finalized, but [feedback would be welcome][51].\n+* We have undertaken a significant reworking of our CMake build system for C++\n+  to make the third party dependencies more configurable. Among other things,\n+  this eases work on packaging for Linux distributions. Read more about this in\n+  the [C++ developer documentation][18].\n+* Laying more groundwork for an Arrow-native in-memory query engine\n+* We began building a reader for line-delimited JSON files\n+* Gandiva can now be compiled on Windows with Visual Studio\n+\n+## C# Notes\n+\n+C# .NET development has picked up since the initial code donation last\n+fall. 11 issues were resolved this release cycle.\n+\n+The Arrow C# package is now available via NuGet.\n+\n+## Go notes\n+\n+8 Go-related issues were resolved. A notable feature is the addition of a CSV\n+file writer.\n+\n+## Java notes\n+\n+26 Java issues were resolved. Outside of Flight-related work, some notable\n+items include:\n+\n+* Migration to Java 8 date and time APIs from Joda\n+* Array type support in JDBC adapter\n+\n+## Python notes\n+\n+86 Python-related issues were resolved. Some highlights include:\n+\n+* The Gandiva LLVM expression compiler is now available in the Python wheels\n+  through the ``pyarrow.gandiva`` module.\n+* Flight RPC bindings\n+* Improved pandas serialization performance with RangeIndex\n+* pyarrow can be used without pandas installed\n+\n+Note that Apache Arrow will continue to support Python 2.7 until January 2020.\n+\n+## Ruby and C GLib notes\n+\n+36 C/GLib- and Ruby-related issues were resolved. The work continues to follow\n+the upstream work in the C++ project.\n+\n+## Rust notes\n+\n+69 Rust-related issues were resolved. Many of these relate to ongoing work in\n+the DataFusion query engine. Some notable items include:\n+\n+* Parallel file scans in DataFusion\n+* Prototype DataFrame-style API for DataFusion\n+* Writing CSV files\n+* Continued evolution of Parquet file reader\n+\n+## R development progress\n+\n+The Arrow R developers have expanded the scope of the R language bindings and\n+additionally worked on packaging support to be able to submit the package to\n+CRAN in the near future. 23 issues were resolved for this release.\n+\n+[We wrote in January about ongoing work][50] to accelerate R work on Apache Spark\n+using Arrow.\n+\n+## Community Discussions Ongoing\n+\n+There are a number of active discussions ongoing on the developer\n+``dev@arrow.apache.org`` mailing list. We look forward to hearing from the\n+community there:\n+\n+* **Benchmarking**: we are working to create tools for tracking all of our\n+  benchmark results on a commit-by-commit basis in a centralized database\n+  schema so that we can monitor for performance regressions over time. We hope\n+  to develop a publicly viewable benchmark result dashboard.\n+* **C++ Datasets**: development of a unified API for reading and writing\n+  datasets stored in various common formats like Parquet, JSON, and CSV.\n+* **C++ Query Engine**: architecture of a parallel Arrow-native query engine\n+  for C++\n+* **Arrow Flight Evolution**: adding features to support different real-world\n+  data messaging use cases\n+* **Arrow Columnar Format evolution**: we are discussing a new \"duration\" or\n+  \"time interval\" type and some other additions to the Arrow columnar format.\n+\n+[1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.13.0\n+[2]: https://arrow.apache.org/install\n+[3]: https://arrow.apache.org/release/0.13.0.html\n+[13]: https://github.com/andygrove\n+[14]: https://github.com/emkornfield\n+[17]: http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/arrow-rust-datafusion.html\n+[18]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/cpp.rst#build-dependency-management\n+[19]: http://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/02/04/datafusion-donation/\n+[20]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/util/trie.h\n \n Review comment:\n   Unused link.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

The [complete changelog][3] is also available.\n+\n+While it's a large release, this post will give some brief highlights in the\n+project since the 0.12.0 release from January.\n+\n+## New committer and PMC member\n+\n+The Arrow team is growing! Since the 0.12.0 release we have increased the size\n+of our committer and PMC rosters.\n+\n+* [Andy Grove][13] was promoted to PMC member\n+* [Micah Kornfield][14] was added as a committer\n+\n+Thank you for all your contributions!\n+\n+## Rust DataFusion Query Engine donation\n+\n+Since the last release, we received a donation of [DataFusion][17], a\n+Rust-native query engine for the Arrow columnar format, whose development had\n+been led prior by Andy grove. [Read more about DataFusion][19] in our February\n+blog post.\n+\n+This is an exciting development for the Rust community, and we look forward to\n+developing more analytical query processing within the Apache Arrow project.\n+\n+## Arrow Flight gRPC progress\n+\n+Over the last couple months, we have made significant progress on Arrow Flight,\n+an Arrow-native data messaging framework. We have have integration tests to\n+check C++ and Java compatibility, an we have added Python bindings for the C++\n+library. We will write a future blog post to go into more detail about how\n+Flight works.\n+\n+## C++ notes\n+\n+There were 231 issues relating to C++ in this release, far too much to\n+summarize in a blog post. Some notable items include:\n+\n+* An experimental `ExtensionType` was developed for creating user-defined data\n+  types that can be embedded in the Arrow binary protocol. This is not yet\n+  finalized, but [feedback would be welcome][51].\n+* We have undertaken a significant reworking of our CMake build system for C++\n+  to make the third party dependencies more configurable. Among other things,\n+  this eases work on packaging for Linux distributions. Read more about this in\n+  the [C++ developer documentation][18].\n+* Laying more groundwork for an Arrow-native in-memory query engine\n+* We began building a reader for line-delimited JSON files\n+* Gandiva can now be compiled on Windows with Visual Studio\n+\n+## C# Notes\n+\n+C# .NET development has picked up since the initial code donation last\n+fall. 11 issues were resolved this release cycle.\n+\n+The Arrow C# package is now available via NuGet.\n+\n+## Go notes\n+\n+8 Go-related issues were resolved. A notable feature is the addition of a CSV\n+file writer.\n+\n+## Java notes\n+\n+26 Java issues were resolved. Outside of Flight-related work, some notable\n+items include:\n+\n+* Migration to Java 8 date and time APIs from Joda\n+* Array type support in JDBC adapter\n+\n+## Python notes\n+\n+86 Python-related issues were resolved. Some highlights include:\n+\n+* The Gandiva LLVM expression compiler is now available in the Python wheels\n+  through the ``pyarrow.gandiva`` module.\n+* Flight RPC bindings\n+* Improved pandas serialization performance with RangeIndex\n+* pyarrow can be used without pandas installed\n+\n+Note that Apache Arrow will continue to support Python 2.7 until January 2020.\n+\n+## Ruby and C GLib notes\n+\n+36 C/GLib- and Ruby-related issues were resolved. The work continues to follow\n+the upstream work in the C++ project.\n+\n \n Review comment:\n   Ruby has the following notable improvement: \r\n   \r\n   - `Arrow::RecordBatch#raw_records` was added. It can convert a record batch to a Ruby's array in 10x-200x faster than the same conversion by a pure-Ruby implementation.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
