See the Install Page to learn how to\n+get the libraries for your platform.\n+\n+The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights\n+of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer\n+you to the [complete changelog][3].\n+\n+## Community\n+\n+Since the 0.16.0 release, two committers have joined the Project Management\n+Committee (PMC):\n+\n+* [Neal Richardson][4]\n+* [Fran\u00e7ois Saint-Jacques][5]\n+\n+Thank you for all your contributions!\n+\n+## Columnar Format Notes\n+\n+A [C-level Data Interface][6] was designed to ease data sharing inside a single process. It allows different runtimes or libraries to share Arrow data using a well-known binary layout and metadata representation, without any copies. The C++ library now includes an implementation of this specification, and Python and R have bindings to that implementation.\n+\n+## Arrow Flight RPC notes\n+\n+* Adopted new DoExchange bi-directional data RPC\n+* ListFlights supports being passed a Criteria argument in Java/C++/Python. This allows applications to search for flights satisfying a given query.\n+* Custom metadata can be attached to errors that the server sends to the client, which can be used to encode richer application-specific information.\n+* A number of minor bugs were fixed, including proper handling of empty null arrays in Java and round-tripping of certain Arrow status codes in C++/Python.\n+\n+## C++ notes\n+\n+### Feather V2\n+\n+The \"Feather V2\" format based on the Arrow IPC file format was developed.\n+Feather v2 features full support for all Arrow data types,\n+and resolves the 2GB per-column limitation for large amounts of string data that\n+the [original Feather implementation][13] had.\n+Feather V2 also introduces experimental IPC message compression using LZ4 frame format or ZSTD. This will be formalized later in the Arrow format.\n+\n+### C++ Datasets\n+\n+TODO: SUMMARIZE C++ DATASETS WORK\n\nReview comment:\n       @fsaintjacques \n\n##########\nFile path: _posts/2020-04-21-0.17.0-release.md\n##########\n@@ -0,0 +1,197 @@\n+---\n+layout: post\n+title: \"Apache Arrow 0.17.0 Release\"\n+date: \"2020-04-21 00:00:00 -0600\"\n+author: pmc\n+categories: [release]\n+---\n+<!--\n+{% comment %}\n+Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+contributor license agreements.

See the Install Page to learn how to\n+get the libraries for your platform.\n+\n+The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights\n+of the release.

This will be formalized later in the Arrow format.\n+\n+### C++ Datasets\n+\n+TODO: SUMMARIZE C++ DATASETS WORK\n+\n+### C++ Parquet notes\n+\n+* Complete support for writing nested types to Parquet format was completed. The legacy code can be accessed through parquet write option C++ and an environment variable in Python. Read support will come in a future release.\n+* The BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT encoding was implemented for floating-point types. It helps improve the efficiency of memory compression for high-entropy data.\n+* Expose Parquet schema field_id as Arrow field metadata\n+* Support for DataPageV2\n+\n+### C++ build notes\n+\n+* We continued to make the core C++ library build simpler and faster. Among the improvements are the removal of the dependency on Thrift Compiler at build time; while Parquet still requires `thrift-cpp`, its dependencies are much lighter. We also further reduced the number of build configurations that require `boost`, and when `boost` is needed to be built, we only download the components we need, reducing the size of the `boost` bundle by 90%.\n+* TODO: ARM64 platform notes?\n+* TODO: LLVM 8 upgrade?\n+* Simplified SIMD build configuration with ARROW_SIMD_LEVEL option allowing no SIMD, SSE4.2, AVX2, or AVX512 to be selected.\n+* Fixed a number of bugs affecting compilation on aarch64 platforms\n+\n+### Other C++ notes\n+\n+* Many crashes on invalid input detected by [OSS-Fuzz][7] in the IPC reader and in Parquet-Arrow reading were fixed. See our recent [blog post][8] for more details.\n+* A \u201cDevice\u201d abstraction was added to simplify buffer management and movement across heterogeneous hardware configurations, e.g. CPUs and GPUs.\n+* A streaming CSV reader was implemented, yielding individual RecordBatches and helping limit overall memory occupation.\n+* Array casting from Decimal128 to integer types and to Decimal128 with different scale/precision was added.\n+* Sparse CSF tensors are now supported.\n+* When creating an Array, the null bitmap is not kept if the null count is known to be zero\n+* Compressor support for the LZ4 frame format (LZ4_FRAME) was added\n+* An event-driven interface for reading IPC streams was added.\n+* Further core APIs that required passing an explicit out-parameter were migrated to Result<T>.\n+\n+TODO: New analytics kernels (match, sort indices / argsort, top-k)\n+TODO: New Gandiva features?\n\nReview comment:\n       @praveenbingo @bkietz \n\n##########\nFile path: _posts/2020-04-21-0.17.0-release.md\n##########\n@@ -0,0 +1,197 @@\n+---\n+layout: post\n+title: \"Apache Arrow 0.17.0 Release\"\n+date: \"2020-04-21 00:00:00 -0600\"\n+author: pmc\n+categories: [release]\n+---\n+<!--\n+{% comment %}\n+Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+contributor license agreements.

To enable, pass `use_legacy_dataset=False`.
