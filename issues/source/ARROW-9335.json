In the latest revision, I tried something along the lines of https://kudu.apache.org/, with a short home page plus a longer overview page. But in the end, the overview page I ended up with wasn't that long. So we could fold that back into the home page and delete the overview page for now. I think there's value in a page that explains the origin and value proposition of Arrow, and that that (full) discussion doesn't belong on the home page. But if we aren't able right now to do that page properly, maybe we should cut it and fold some of the content back to the home page.\r\n   \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

Most notable are the work in support of allocating large arrow buffers and removing Netty from the public API. Users will have to update their dependencies to use one of the two supported allocators Netty: `arrow-memory-netty` or Unsafe (internal java api for direct memory) `arrow-memory-unsafe`.\r\n   \r\n   The Java Vector implementation has improved its interoperability having verified `LargeVarChar`, `LargeBinary`, `LargeList`, `Union`, Extension types and duplicate field names in `Structs` are binary compatible with C++ and the specification.\r\n   \r\n   For more on what\u2019s in the 1.0.0 R package, see the [Java changelog][5].\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

Middleware in all languages now expose binary-valued headers. Additionally, servers and clients can set Arrow IPC read/write options in all languages, making compatibility easier with earlier versions of Arrow Flight.\r\n   \r\n   In C++ and Python, Flight now exposes more options from gRPC, including the address of the client (on the server) and the ability to set low-level gRPC client options. Flight also supports mTLS for authentication and the ability for a client to control the size of a data message on the wire.\r\n   ```\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

Most notable are the work in support of allocating large arrow buffers and removing Netty from the public API. Users will have to update their dependencies to use one of the two supported allocators Netty: `arrow-memory-netty` or Unsafe (internal java api for direct memory) `arrow-memory-unsafe`.\r\n   \r\n   The Java Vector implementation has improved its interoperability having verified `LargeVarChar`, `LargeBinary`, `LargeList`, `Union`, Extension types and duplicate field names in `Structs` are binary compatible with C++ and the specification.\r\n   ``` \n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

Using UInt64 is still discouraged because of poor Java\n+  support.\n+\n+* A \"Feature\" enum has been added to announce the use of specific optional\n+  features in an IPC stream, such as buffer compression (ARROW-9308).  This\n+  new field is not used by any implementation yet.\n+\n+* Optional buffer compression using LZ4 or ZStandard was added to the IPC\n+  format (ARROW-300).\n+\n+* Decimal types now have an optional \"bitWidth\" field, defaulting to 128\n+  (ARROW-8985).  This will allow for future support of other decimal widths\n+  such as 32- and 64-bit.\n+\n+The 1.0 major release indicates that the Arrow columnar format is declared\n+stable, with [forward and backward compatibility guarantees][5].\n+\n+Integration testing has been expanded to test for extension types and\n+nested dictionaries.\n+\n+XXX Link to implementation matrix\n+\n+Format changes: unions, unsigned int dictionary indices, decimal bit width, feature enum.\n+\n+## Community\n+\n+Since the last release, we have added two new committers:\n+\n+* Liya Fan\n+* Ji Liu\n+\n+Thank you for all your contributions!\n+\n+<!-- Acknowledge and link to any new committers and PMC members since the last release. See previous release announcements for examples. -->\n+\n+## Arrow Flight RPC notes\n+\n+Flight now offers DoExchange, a fully bidirectional data endpoint, in addition\n+to DoGet and DoPut, in C++, Java, and Python. Middlewares in all languages now\n+expose binary-valued headers. Additionally, servers and clients can set Arrow\n+IPC read/write options in all languages, making compatibility easier with earlier\n+versions of Arrow Flight.\n+\n+In C++ and Python, Flight now exposes more options from gRPC, including the\n+address of the client (on the server) and the ability to set low-level gRPC\n+client options. Flight also supports mutual TLS authentication and the ability\n+for a client to control the size of a data message on the wire.\n+\n+## C++ notes\n+\n+Support for static linking with Arrow has been vastly improved, including the\n+introduction of a `libarrow_bundled_dependencies.a` library bundling all\n+required dependencies together (ARROW-7605).\n+\n+Following the Arrow format changes, Union arrays cannot have a top-level\n+bitmap anymore (ARROW-9278; see also the IPC changes below).\n+\n+A number of improvements were made to reduce the overall code size in the\n+Arrow library.\n+\n+A convenience API `GetBuildInfo` allows querying the characteristics of\n+the Arrow library (ARROW-6521).  We encourage you to suggest any desired\n+addition to the returned information.\n+\n+We added an optional dependency to the `utf8proc` library, used in several\n+compute functions (ARROW-8961; see below).\n+\n+Instead of sharing the same concrete classes, sparse and dense unions now\n+have separated classes (`SparseUnionType` and `DenseUnionType`, as well\n+as `SparseUnionArray`, `DenseUnionArray`, `SparseUnionScalar`,\n+`DenseUnionScalar`; ARROW-8866).\n+\n+Arrow can now be built for iOS using the right set of CMake options, though\n+we don't officially support it (ARROW-8795).  See\n+[this writeup](https://github.com/UnfoldedInc/deck.gl-native-dependencies/blob/master/docs/iOS-BUILD.md#arrow-v0170)\n+for details.\n+\n+### Compute functions\n+\n+The compute kernel layer was extensively reworked (ARROW-8792).  It now offers\n+a generic function lookup, dispatch and execution mechanism.  Furthermore,\n+elaborate internal scaffoldings make it vastly easier to write new function\n+kernels.\n+\n+Several compute functions have been added.  Unicode-compliant predicates and\n+transforms, such as lowercase and uppercase transforms, are now available.\n+\n+The available compute functions are listed exhaustively in the Sphinx-generated\n+documentation.\n+\n+### Datasets\n+\n+Datasets can now be read from CSV files (ARROW-7759).\n+\n+### Feather\n+\n+The Feather format is now available in version 2, which is simply the Arrow\n+IPC file format with another name.\n+\n+### IPC\n+\n+By default, we now write IPC streams with metadata V5.  However, metadata V4\n+can be requested by setting the appropriate member in `IpcWriteOptions`.\n+\n+V4 as well as V5 metadata IPC streams can be read properly, with one\n+exception: a V4 metadata stream containing Union arrays with top-level\n+null values will refuse reading.\n+\n+Support for dictionary replacement and dictionary delta was implemented\n+(ARROW-7285).\n+\n+### Parquet\n+\n+Writing files with the LZ4 codec is disabled, because it produces files\n+incompatible with the widely-used Hadoop Parquet implementation (ARROW-9424).\n+Support will be reenabled once we align the LZ4 implementation with the\n+special buffer encoding expected by Hadoop.\n+\n+## C# notes\n+\n+## Go notes\n+\n+## Java notes\n+\n+## JavaScript notes\n+\n+## Python notes\n+\n+The size of wheel packages is significantly reduced.  One side effect is\n+that these wheels do not enable Gandiva anymore (ARROW-5082).\n+\n+The Scalar class hierarchy was reworked to more closely follow its C++\n+counterpart (ARROW-9017).\n+\n+TLS CA certificates are looked up more reliably when using the S3 filesystem,\n+especially with manylinux wheels (ARROW-9261).\n+\n+The encoding of CSV files can now be specified explicitly, defaulting to UTF8\n+(ARROW-9106).  Custom timestamp parsers can now be used for CSV files\n+(ARROW-8711).\n+\n+Filesystems can now be implemented in pure Python (ARROW-8766).  As a result,\n+[fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io)-based filesystems can now\n+be used in datasets (ARROW-9383).\n+\n+## R notes\n+\n+The R package added support for converting to and from many additional Arrow types. Tables showing how R types are mapped to Arrow types and vice versa have been added to the [introductory vignette][6], and nearly all types are handled. In addition, R `attributes` like custom classes and metadata are now preserved when converting a `data.frame` to an Arrow Table and are restored when loading them back into R.\n\nReview comment:\n       Please, can text be properly word-wrapped at ~80 characters for easier review and editing?\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

The Arrow format\n+allows different programs and runtimes, perhaps written in different languages,\n+to share data efficiently using a set of rich data types (included nested\n+and user-defined data types).  The Arrow libraries make it easy to write such\n+programs, by sparing the programmer from implementing low-level details of the\n+Arrow format.\n+\n+Arrow additionally defines a streaming format and a file format for\n+inter-process communication (IPC), based on the in-memory format.  It also\n+defines a generic client-server RPC mechanism (Flight RPC), based on the\n+IPC format, and implemented on top of the gRPC framework.  <!-- TODO links -->\n+\n+### Why create a new standard?\n+\n+<!-- Fill this in -->\n+\n+## Project status\n+\n ### How stable is the Arrow format? Is it safe to use in my application?\n+<!-- Revise this -->\n+\n+The Arrow *in-memory format* is considered stable, and we intend to make only\n+backwards-compatible changes, such as additional data types.  It is used by\n+many applications already, and you can trust that compatibility will not be\n+broken.\n+\n+The Arrow *file format* (based on the Arrow IPC mechanism) is not recommended\n+for long-term disk persistence of data; that said, it is perfectly acceptable\n+to write Arrow memory to disk for purposes of memory mapping and caching.\n+\n+We encourage people to start building Arrow-based in-memory computing\n+applications now, and choose a suitable file format for disk storage\n+if necessary. The Arrow libraries include adapters for several file formats,\n+including Parquet, ORC, CSV, and JSON.\n+\n+### How stable are the Arrow libraries?\n+\n+Some implementations of Arrow are more complete and more stable than others.\n+We refer you to the [implementation matrix](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/status.rst).\n\nReview comment:\n       I've done this.\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
