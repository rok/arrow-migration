The larger picture though is that the overall Java API of Arrow itself is still pretty limited and inefficient, even after 5 years in development! And there _are_ users such as [~benjamin.wilhelm@knime.com] that require more performance, and that's why there are also JavaCPP Presets for the C++ API of Arrow: [https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/arrow]\r\n\r\nNow, the C++ API doesn't always map very elegantly to Java, but it is tons faster, and maps a lot more functionality. This would be a discussion for another thread, but if the Java API of Arrow were to be based on JavaCPP, it would allow users to fall back easily on that API, instead of forcing them to start hacking stuff in JNI. Case in point, the {{arrow::util::Codec}} class has been usable from Java for almost 2 years now:\r\n[https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/blob/master/arrow/src/gen/java/org/bytedeco/arrow/Codec.java]\r\n\r\nI would be happy to maintain those presets as part of the Arrow project, just like I'm currently doing in the case of TensorFlow for Java: [https://github.com/tensorflow/java/search?q=javacpp]\r\n\r\nPrevious discussions with people from Apache Arrow didn't elicit much interest, but in time the need for a tool like Cython in Java will become obvious to all, and JavaCPP already provides that!",

The JavaCPP project was the easiest and fastest way to get a very fast LZ4 API for Java (supporting frame compression as needed). I already implemented {{CompressionCodec}} using these bindings, and we (at KNIME) will use it with the next release.\r\n\r\nSeeing where the JavaCPP is used I think it is a viable project.
