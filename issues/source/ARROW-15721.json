A\n+database client can use the provided Flight SQL client to interact\n+with any database that supports the necessary endpoints. Flight SQL\n+clients wrap the underlying Flight client to provide methods for the\n+new RPC methods described here.\n+\n+.. warning:: Flight SQL is **experimental** and changes to the\n+             protocol may still be made.\n+\n+RPC Methods\n+===========\n+\n+Flight SQL reuses the predefined RPC methods in Arrow Flight, and\n+provides various commands that pair those methods with request/response\n+messages defined via Protobuf (see below).\n+\n+SQL Metadata\n+------------\n+\n+Flight SQL provides a variety of commands to fetch catalog metadata\n+about the database server.\n+\n+All of these commands can be used with the GetFlightInfo and GetSchema\n+RPC methods. The Protobuf request message should be packed into a\n+google.protobuf.Any message, then serialized and packed as the ``cmd``\n+field in a CMD-type FlightDescriptor.\n+\n+If the command is used with GetFlightInfo, the server will return a\n+FlightInfo response. The client should then use the Ticket(s) in the\n+FlightInfo with the DoGet RPC method to fetch a Arrow data containing\n+the results of the command. In other words, metadata is returned as\n+Arrow data, just like query results themselves.\n+\n+The schema returned by GetSchema or DoGet for a particular command is\n+fixed according to the specification.\n+\n+``CommandGetCatalogs``\n+    List the catalogs available in the database. The definition varies\n+    by vendor.\n+\n+``CommandGetCrossReference``\n+    List the foreign key columns in a given table that reference\n+    columns in a given parent table.\n+\n+``CommandGetDbSchemas``\n+    List the schemas (note: a grouping of tables, *not* an Arrow\n+    schema) available in the database. The definition varies by\n+    vendor.\n+\n+``CommandGetExportedKeys``\n+    List foreign key columns that reference the primary key columns of\n+    a given table.\n+\n+``CommandGetImportedKeys``\n+    List foreign keys of a given table.\n+\n+``CommandGetPrimaryKeys``\n+    List the primary keys of a given table.\n+\n+``CommandGetSqlInfo``\n+    Fetch metadata about the database server and its supported SQL\n+    features.\n+\n+``CommandGetTables``\n+    List tables in the database.\n+\n+``CommandGetTableTypes``\n+    List table types in the database. The list of types varies by\n+    vendor.\n+\n+Query Execution\n+---------------\n+\n+Flight SQL also provides commands to execute SQL queries and manage\n+prepared statements.\n+\n+Many of these commands are also used with GetFlightInfo/GetSchema and\n+work identically to the metadata methods above. Some of these commands\n+can be used with the DoPut RPC method, but the command should still be\n+encoded in the request FlightDescriptor in the same way.\n+\n+Commands beginning with \"Action\" are instead used with the DoAction\n+RPC method, in which case the command should be packed into a\n+google.protobuf.Any message, then serialized and packed into the\n+``body`` of a Flight Action. Also, the ``type`` should be set to the\n+command name (i.e. for ``ActionClosePreparedStatementRequest``, the\n+``type`` should be ``ClosePreparedStatement``).\n+\n+``ActionClosePreparedStatementRequest``\n+    Close a previously created prepared statement.\n+\n+``ActionCreatePreparedStatementRequest``\n+    Create a new prepared statement for a SQL query.\n+\n+``CommandPreparedStatementQuery``\n+    Execute a previously created prepared statement and get the results.\n\nReview comment:\n       It is reusable (else, you don't save much from having a prepared statement).\n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: github-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

A\n+database client can use the provided Flight SQL client to interact\n+with any database that supports the necessary endpoints. Flight SQL\n+clients wrap the underlying Flight client to provide methods for the\n+new RPC methods described here.\n+\n+.. warning:: Flight SQL is **experimental** and changes to the\n+             protocol may still be made.\n+\n+RPC Methods\n+===========\n+\n+Flight SQL reuses the predefined RPC methods in Arrow Flight, and\n+provides various commands that pair those methods with request/response\n+messages defined via Protobuf (see below).\n+\n+SQL Metadata\n+------------\n+\n+Flight SQL provides a variety of commands to fetch catalog metadata\n+about the database server.\n+\n+All of these commands can be used with the GetFlightInfo and GetSchema\n+RPC methods. The Protobuf request message should be packed into a\n+google.protobuf.Any message, then serialized and packed as the ``cmd``\n+field in a CMD-type FlightDescriptor.\n\nReview comment:\n       Hmm, we would probably need to have Sphinx index the Protobuf file somehow and then use Sphinx's cross-reference support. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be such integration from a quick glance (and if we wanted to do it, we would need to create a custom Protobuf plugin or modify the existing one (which supports neither Doxygen nor Sphinx): https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc/\n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: github-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
