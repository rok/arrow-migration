                    "body": "Some notes from a recent first-time contributor.\r\n * My route to contribution was _not_ \"go to project website, go to contributing page, drill down from there\".\r\n * Rather, it was:\r\n ** at work, I am working on a large codebase which uses pyarrow;\r\n ** I found a gap in functionality and believed I could fill it with a [PR|https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13633];\r\n ** The natural path seemed to be to find the pyarrow project on GitHub and find my way from there.\r\n\r\nRightly or wrongly, I did not know about [this page|https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/contributing.html] until this docs ticket was opened; admittedly I missed its mention at the bottom of [CONTRIBUTING.md|https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md] (which I looked for and found at the start, per open-source convention).\r\n\r\nMy expectation was that the repo's contributing directions would include something like:\r\n * \"Clone the repo and do `docker-compose up test` to run the pyarrow test suite.\"\r\n * \"Our CI system has steps foo, bar, and baz. Once these steps pass on your PR, please contact the CODEOWNERS of the relevant part of the source tree for review.\"\r\n * \"Discussion takes place on mailing list X.\"\r\n * \"The process from raising of PR to release is <snip>.\"\r\n\r\nThe actual situation that played out was as follows:\r\n * From VSCode on an M1 Mac, I did not know where to begin to build or test anything, or even if it would work on M1.\r\n * I created a Jira account and ticket as directed, and started a PR. (I could not `Start Progress` on the ticket, but this has since been fixed.)\r\n ** It might be worth mentioning in docs that use of Jira is just standard practice in Apache projects: to me it felt somewhat \"against-the-grain\".\r\n * There were some pleasant surprises at this point for which I think the Arrow regulars should be proud of themselves:\r\n ** response to the Jira ticket was quick;\r\n ** response to the PR was quick and seemingly automatic: I don't know how awareness of it came about but I soon had constructive comments from people whom I assume to be maintainers;\r\n ** everyone was very patient and there was no hint of any unsporting comments;\r\n ** I do not mean to sound in any way patronising in saying all this; I was honestly pleasantly surprised that this large project seems free from inane, low-quality or LKML-tier abusive comments. {*}That's as it should be{*}, but sadly first-time contributors may be bracing themselves for a harsh experience, as I had been.\r\n * I did not know how to build or test anything locally; I had never heard of Cython; it's been 20+ years since I last looked at K&R, so the baptism of fire entailed:\r\n ** make a change, push it, wait a while, see what CI says\r\n ** repeat\r\n ** try not to exhaust the patience of the maintainers who showed up.\r\n * The code review was meticulous and I appreciated that, because having quickly found myself in unfamiliar territory of C++ and Cython, I would not like to leave anything to a hand-wavey \"oh it's fine\".\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is becoming longwinded so I will try to summarise:\r\n\r\n\"What would reduce friction?\"\r\n * Reduce CONTRIBUTING.md to no more than a link to the project website's documentation on contributing. Reduces repetition.\r\n * One or both of:\r\n ** \"Here is a one-shot docker command to perform [a subset of] CI checks locally\"\r\n ** \"Here is a list of dependencies to install on a virgin dev machine\"\r\n * Bonus: \"build a pyarrow test package for your own integration testing as follows...\"\r\n * Link to the mailing list archives so that people can quickly see the high quality of the community\r\n * Outline how and when to invite maintainers to perform a code review, and what expectations to have of them (are they spare-time volunteers? paid full-time?)\r\n * Outline the broad strokes of the release cadence(s) for the project.\r\n\r\n[~toddfarmer] , hope that helps :)\u00a0",
