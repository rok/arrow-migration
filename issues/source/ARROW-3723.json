Red Plasma is based on GObject Introspection.\n+\n+Plasma is an in-memory object store and cache for big data.\n+\n+[GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) is a middleware for language bindings of C library. GObject Introspection can generate language bindings automatically at runtime.\n+\n+Red Plasma uses [Plasma GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/c_glib/plasma-glib) and [gobject-introspection gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/gobject-introspection) to generate Ruby bindings of Plasma.\n+\n+Plasma GLib is a C wrapper for [Plasma C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/plasma). GObject Introspection can't use Plasma C++ directly. Plasma GLib is a bridge between Plasma C++ and GObject Introspection.\n+\n+gobject-introspection gem is a Ruby bindings of GObject Introspection. Red Plasma uses GObject Introspection via gobject-introspection gem.\n+\n+## Install\n+\n+Install Plasma GLib before install Red Plasma. Use [packages.red-data-tools.org](https://github.com/red-data-tools/packages.red-data-tools.org) for installing Plasma GLib.\n+\n+Note that the Plasma GLib packages are \"unofficial\". \"Official\" packages will be released in the future.\n+\n+Install Red Plasma after you install Plasma GLib:\n+\n+```text\n+% gem install red-plasma\n+```\n+\n+## Usage\n+\n+Starting the Plasma store\n+\n+```console\n+plasma_store_server -m 1000000000 -s /tmp/plasma\n+```\n+\n+Creating a Plasma client\n+\n+```ruby\n+require \"plasma\"\n+\n+client = Plasma::Client.new(\"/tmp/plasma\")\n+```\ndiff --git a/ruby/red-plasma/Rakefile b/ruby/red-plasma/Rakefile\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000000..96851afb9f\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/ruby/red-plasma/Rakefile\n@@ -0,0 +1,39 @@\n+# -*- ruby -*-\n+#\n+# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+# or more contributor license agreements.
