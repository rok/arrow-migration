Our intention is to suggest folks use `NOT_CRAN=TRUE` which should set all of those to on (along with a few other niceties like downloading binaries). Hopefully that helps get full builds with minimal hassle (only needing to remember one env var) Have you experienced that _not_ working? If so, we would love to hear about it so we can figure out what happened + fix it. \r\n   \r\n   Additionally, the parquet/snappy flags are also now on by default so hopefully regardless of env vars set they should be enabled (well, unless you _explicitly_ override them and set them to no, then they won't...).\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: github-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

When I read the article it wasn't immediately apparent that these were on by default and I must have glazed over the part of NOT_CRAN=TRUE. One thing that could be helpful is adding some additional description to each of the ENV var descriptions starting around L415.
