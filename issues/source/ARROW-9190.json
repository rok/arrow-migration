As the scope of the project has grown, we have sometimes\n+taken on additional library dependencies to support a wide variety of systems\n+and data processing tasks.\n+\n+While these dependencies give us leverage on hard problems, in some cases their\n+addition has caused extra complexity for projects that depend on Arrow, even if\n+their use of Arrow is limited to basic interactions with the Arrow columnar\n+format. Some projects have therefore been concerned about the implications of\n+taking on the Arrow C++ library as a dependency if Arrow's build and runtime\n+requirements spill over into their project's requirements.

Over the last year, we have undertaken a number of significant\n+projects to accommodate the different ways that people want to depend on Arrow\n+C++.

Compared to a year ago,\n+the build experience is much more reliable on a wider range of platforms,\n+requires fewer dependencies, and yields smaller package sizes.\n+\n+## Minimal default build options\n+\n+One rough edge for people using Arrow as a dependency was that many optional\n+project components were enabled in the build by default, thus requiring any\n+extra dependencies of those optional components. Rather than expecting users to\n+disable optional components one by one, we have made the default for all\n+optional components to be `OFF` so that the default configuration is a\n+dependency-free minimal core build.\n+\n+The only third-party library enabled by default is jemalloc, the project's\n+recommended memory allocator. Given that Arrow applications often process large\n+volumes of data, we have found additionally that using memory allocators\n+provided by projects like jemalloc and mimalloc yield significantly better\n+performance over the default system allocators. Even so, this can also be\n+disabled if desired.\n+\n+To demonstrate a minimal build, we have provided a\n+[Dockerfile](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/examples/minimal_build/Dockerfile)\n+which can be used to build the project requiring only CMake and a C++ compiler\n+with zero dependencies. Additionally, we have included an\n+[example](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/examples/minimal_build)\n+of including Arrow as an external project dependency in another CMake project.\n+\n+## Flexible dependency configuration in CMake\n+\n+As part of improving our CMake-based build system, we have made the\n+configuration of build dependencies both flexible and consistent for different\n+users' needs. In some cases, developers want Arrow to build against dependencies\n+provided by an external package manager, such as apt in Debian-based Linux\n+distributions. In other cases, developers may want to avoid any quirks of system\n+libraries and build all dependencies together with the Arrow build.\n+\n+For each package, the `$Library_SOURCE` CMake option can be set to one of three\n\nReview comment:\n       Some readers may think whole `$Library_SOURCE` is variable.\r\n   How about using `${Library}` instead of `$Library`?\r\n   \r\n   ```suggestion\r\n   For each package, the `${Library}_SOURCE` CMake option can be set to one of three\r\n   ```\n\n##########\nFile path: _posts/2020-07-27-cpp-build-simplification.md\n##########\n@@ -0,0 +1,271 @@\n+---\n+layout: post\n+title: \"INSERT TITLE HERE\"\n+date: \"2020-07-24 00:00:00 -0600\"\n+author: pmc\n+categories: [application]\n+---\n+<!--\n+{% comment %}\n+Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+contributor license agreements.

As the scope of the project has grown, we have sometimes\n+taken on additional library dependencies to support a wide variety of systems\n+and data processing tasks.\n+\n+While these dependencies give us leverage on hard problems, in some cases their\n+addition has caused extra complexity for projects that depend on Arrow, even if\n+their use of Arrow is limited to basic interactions with the Arrow columnar\n+format.

Indeed, in the\n+earlier stages of the Arrow project development, dependency management issues\n+did cause problems for early adopters.\n+\n+We want developers to trust that they can use and depend on our libraries, and\n+that doing so doesn't add a burden for their own project maintenance or for\n+their users. Over the last year, we have undertaken a number of significant\n+projects to accommodate the different ways that people want to depend on Arrow\n+C++.

And we've worked to make builds faster and more compact, even as we\n+continue to add new functionality.\n\nReview comment:\n       Maybe \"This also includes a zero-dependency option for projects that wish to use the Arrow C++ core but take on no transitive dependencies.\"\n\n##########\nFile path: _posts/2020-07-27-cpp-build-simplification.md\n##########\n@@ -0,0 +1,271 @@\n+---\n+layout: post\n+title: \"INSERT TITLE HERE\"\n\nReview comment:\n       Something like\r\n   \r\n   Arrow C++ Build System Enhancements: Better Configurability and easier Minimal or Zero-Dependency Builds\n\n##########\nFile path: _posts/2020-07-27-cpp-build-simplification.md\n##########\n@@ -0,0 +1,271 @@\n+---\n+layout: post\n+title: \"INSERT TITLE HERE\"\n\nReview comment:\n       SGTM\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
