Red Gandiva is based on GObject Introspection.\n+\n+Gandiva is a toolset for compiling and evaluating expressions on Arrow data.\n+\n+[GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) is a middleware for language bindings of C library. GObject Introspection can generate language bindings automatically at runtime.\n+\n+Red Gandiva uses [Gandiva GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/c_glib/gandiva-glib) and [gobject-introspection gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/gobject-introspection) to generate Ruby bindings of Gandiva.\n+\n+Gandiva GLib is a C wrapper for [Gandiva C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/gandiva). GObject Introspection can't use Gandiva C++ directly. Gandiva GLib is a bridge between Gandiva C++ and GObject Introspection.\n+\n+gobject-introspection gem is a Ruby bindings of GObject Introspection. Red Gandiva uses GObject Introspection via gobject-introspection gem.\n+\n+## Install\n+\n+Install Gandiva GLib before install Red Gandiva. Use [packages.red-data-tools.org](https://github.com/red-data-tools/packages.red-data-tools.org) for installing Gandiva GLib.\n+\n \n Review comment:\n   We didn't create packages for Gandiva and Gandiva GLib but it's OK. Because we will create them until 0.12.0. :-)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

Red Gandiva is based on GObject Introspection.\n+\n+Gandiva is a toolset for compiling and evaluating expressions on Arrow data.\n+\n+[GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) is a middleware for language bindings of C library. GObject Introspection can generate language bindings automatically at runtime.\n+\n+Red Gandiva uses [Gandiva GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/c_glib/gandiva-glib) and [gobject-introspection gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/gobject-introspection) to generate Ruby bindings of Gandiva.\n+\n+Gandiva GLib is a C wrapper for [Gandiva C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/gandiva). GObject Introspection can't use Gandiva C++ directly. Gandiva GLib is a bridge between Gandiva C++ and GObject Introspection.\n+\n+gobject-introspection gem is a Ruby bindings of GObject Introspection. Red Gandiva uses GObject Introspection via gobject-introspection gem.\n+\n+## Install\n+\n+Install Gandiva GLib before install Red Gandiva. Use [packages.red-data-tools.org](https://github.com/red-data-tools/packages.red-data-tools.org) for installing Gandiva GLib.\n+\n \n Review comment:\n   OK!
