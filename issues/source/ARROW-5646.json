Install Python 3.6:\n+\n+   Miniconda is preferred, see installation instructions:\n+   https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html\n+\n+8.

Try running it:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      $ python crossbow.py --help\n+\n+Usage\n+-----\n+\n+The script does the following:\n+\n+1. Detects the current repository, thus supports forks. The following\n+   snippet will build kszucs\u2019s fork instead of the upstream apache/arrow\n+   repository.\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      $ git clone https://github.com/kszucs/arrow\n+      $ git clone https://github.com/kszucs/crossbow\n+\n+      $ cd arrow/dev/tasks\n+      $ python crossbow.py submit conda-win conda-linux conda-osx\n+\n+2. Gets the HEAD commit of the currently checked out branch and\n+   generates the version number based on `setuptools_scm`_. So to build\n+   a particular branch, just check out before running the script:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      git checkout ARROW-<ticket number>\n+      python dev/tasks/crossbow.py submit --dry-run conda-linux conda-osx\n+\n+   ..\n+\n+      Note that the arrow branch must be pushed beforehand, because the\n+      script will clone the selected branch.\n+\n+3. Reads and renders the required build configurations with the\n+   parameters substituted.\n+\n+4. Create a branch per task, prefixed with the job id. For example to\n+   build conda recipes on linux it will create a new branch:\n+   ``crossbow@build-<id>-conda-linux``.\n+\n+5. Pushes the modified branches to GitHub which triggers the builds. For\n+   authentication it uses GitHub OAuth tokens described in the install\n+   section.\n+\n+Query the build status\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   python crossbow.py status <build id / branch name>\n+\n+Download the build artifacts\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   python crossbow.py artifacts <build id / branch name>\n+\n+Examples\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The script accepts a pattern as a first argument to narrow the build\n \n Review comment:\n   Looks like this is missing its example. No idea what \"pattern\" or \"first argument\" means here.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

A job is a git commit on a particular git branch,\n+containing only the required configuration file to run the requested\n+build (like ``.travis.yml``, ``appveyor.yml`` or ``azure-pipelines.yml``).\n+\n+Scheduler\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+`Crossbow.py`_ handles version generation, task rendering and\n+submission. The packaging tasks are defined in ``tasks.yml`` and the\n+integration tests are configured in ``tests.yml``.\n+\n+Install\n+-------\n+\n+   The following guide depends on GitHub, but theoretically any git\n+   server can be used.\n+\n+1. `Create the queue repository`_\n+\n+2. Enable `TravisCI`_, `Appveyor`_, `Azure Pipelines_` and `CircleCI`_\n+   integrations on for the newly created queue repository.\n+\n+   -  turn off Travis\u2019 `auto cancellation`_ feature on branches\n+\n+3. Clone the newly created, by default the scripts looks for\n+   ``crossbow`` next to arrow repository.\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      git clone https://github.com/<user>/crossbow crossbow\n+\n+   **Important note:** Crossbow only supports GitHub token based\n+   authentication. Although it overwrites the repository urls provided with ssh\n+   protocol, it's advisable to use the HTTPS repository URLs.\n+\n+4. `Create a Personal Access Token`_\n+\n+5. Locally export the token as an environment variable:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      export CROSSBOW_GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>\n+\n+   ..\n+\n+      or pass as an argument to the CLI script ``--github-token``\n+\n+6. Export the previously created GitHub token on both CI services:\n+\n+   Use ``CROSSBOW_GITHUB_TOKEN`` encrypted environment variable. You can\n+   set them at the following URLs, where ``ghuser`` is the GitHub\n+   username and ``ghrepo`` is the GitHub repository name (typically\n+   ``crossbow``):\n+\n+   -  TravisCI: ``https://travis-ci.org/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/settings``\n+   -  Appveyor:\n+      ``https://ci.appveyor.com/project/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/settings/environment``\n+   -  CircleCI:\n+      ``https://circleci.com/gh/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/edit#env-vars``\n+\n+   On Appveyor check the ``skip branches without appveyor.yml`` checkbox\n+   on the web UI under crossbow repository\u2019s settings.\n+\n+7.

Locally export the token as an environment variable:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      export CROSSBOW_GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>\n+\n+   ..\n+\n+      or pass as an argument to the CLI script ``--github-token``\n+\n+6. Export the previously created GitHub token on both CI services:\n+\n+   Use ``CROSSBOW_GITHUB_TOKEN`` encrypted environment variable. You can\n+   set them at the following URLs, where ``ghuser`` is the GitHub\n+   username and ``ghrepo`` is the GitHub repository name (typically\n+   ``crossbow``):\n+\n+   -  TravisCI: ``https://travis-ci.org/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/settings``\n+   -  Appveyor:\n+      ``https://ci.appveyor.com/project/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/settings/environment``\n+   -  CircleCI:\n+      ``https://circleci.com/gh/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/edit#env-vars``\n+\n+   On Appveyor check the ``skip branches without appveyor.yml`` checkbox\n+   on the web UI under crossbow repository\u2019s settings.\n+\n+7. Install Python 3.6:\n+\n+   Miniconda is preferred, see installation instructions:\n+   https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html\n+\n+8. Install the python dependencies for the script:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      conda install -c conda-forge -y \\\n+          jinja2 \\\n+          pygit2 \\\n+          click \\\n+          ruamel.yaml \\\n+          setuptools_scm \\\n+          github3.py \\\n+          python-gnupg \\\n+          toolz \\\n+          jira\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      # pygit2 requires libgit2: http://www.pygit2.org/install.html\n+      pip install \\\n+          jinja2 \\\n+          pygit2 \\\n+          click \\\n+          ruamel.yaml \\\n+          setuptools_scm \\\n+          github3.py \\\n+          python-gnupg \\\n+          toolz \\\n+          jira\n+\n+9. Try running it:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      $ python crossbow.py --help\n+\n+Usage\n+-----\n+\n+The script does the following:\n+\n+1. Detects the current repository, thus supports forks. The following\n+   snippet will build kszucs\u2019s fork instead of the upstream apache/arrow\n+   repository.\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      $ git clone https://github.com/kszucs/arrow\n+      $ git clone https://github.com/kszucs/crossbow\n+\n+      $ cd arrow/dev/tasks\n+      $ python crossbow.py submit conda-win conda-linux conda-osx\n+\n+2. Gets the HEAD commit of the currently checked out branch and\n+   generates the version number based on `setuptools_scm`_. So to build\n+   a particular branch, just check out before running the script:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      git checkout ARROW-<ticket number>\n+      python dev/tasks/crossbow.py submit --dry-run conda-linux conda-osx\n+\n+   ..\n+\n+      Note that the arrow branch must be pushed beforehand, because the\n+      script will clone the selected branch.\n+\n+3. Reads and renders the required build configurations with the\n+   parameters substituted.\n+\n+4. Create a branch per task, prefixed with the job id. For example to\n+   build conda recipes on linux it will create a new branch:\n+   ``crossbow@build-<id>-conda-linux``.\n+\n+5. Pushes the modified branches to GitHub which triggers the builds. For\n+   authentication it uses GitHub OAuth tokens described in the install\n+   section.\n+\n+Query the build status\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   python crossbow.py status <build id / branch name>\n \n Review comment:\n   Where do I get the build id / branch name from?\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

Gets the HEAD commit of the currently checked out branch and\n+   generates the version number based on `setuptools_scm`_. So to build\n+   a particular branch, just check out before running the script:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      git checkout ARROW-<ticket number>\n+      python dev/tasks/crossbow.py submit --dry-run conda-linux conda-osx\n+\n+   ..\n+\n+      Note that the arrow branch must be pushed beforehand, because the\n+      script will clone the selected branch.\n+\n+3. Reads and renders the required build configurations with the\n+   parameters substituted.\n+\n+4. Create a branch per task, prefixed with the job id. For example to\n+   build conda recipes on linux it will create a new branch:\n+   ``crossbow@build-<id>-conda-linux``.\n+\n+5. Pushes the modified branches to GitHub which triggers the builds. For\n+   authentication it uses GitHub OAuth tokens described in the install\n+   section.\n+\n+Query the build status\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   python crossbow.py status <build id / branch name>\n+\n+Download the build artifacts\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   python crossbow.py artifacts <build id / branch name>\n+\n+Examples\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The script accepts a pattern as a first argument to narrow the build\n+scope:\n+\n+Run multiple builds:\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   $ python crossbow.py submit debian-stretch conda-linux-gcc-py37\n+   Repository: https://github.com/kszucs/arrow@tasks\n+   Commit SHA: 810a718836bb3a8cefc053055600bdcc440e6702\n+   Version: 0.9.1.dev48+g810a7188.d20180414\n+   Pushed branches:\n+    - debian-stretch\n+    - conda-linux-gcc-py37\n+\n+Just render without applying or committing the changes:\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   $ python crossbow.py submit --dry-run task_name\n+\n+Run only ``conda`` package builds and a Linux one:\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   $ python crossbow.py submit -g conda centos-7\n \n Review comment:\n   Renamed to the long name of the option `--group`\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

A job is a git commit on a particular git branch,\n+containing only the required configuration file to run the requested\n+build (like ``.travis.yml``, ``appveyor.yml`` or ``azure-pipelines.yml``).\n+\n+Scheduler\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+`Crossbow.py`_ handles version generation, task rendering and\n+submission. The packaging tasks are defined in ``tasks.yml`` and the\n+integration tests are configured in ``tests.yml``.\n+\n+Install\n+-------\n+\n+   The following guide depends on GitHub, but theoretically any git\n+   server can be used.\n+\n+1. `Create the queue repository`_\n+\n+2. Enable `TravisCI`_, `Appveyor`_, `Azure Pipelines_` and `CircleCI`_\n+   integrations on for the newly created queue repository.\n+\n+   -  turn off Travis\u2019 `auto cancellation`_ feature on branches\n+\n+3. Clone the newly created, by default the scripts looks for\n+   ``crossbow`` next to arrow repository.\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      git clone https://github.com/<user>/crossbow crossbow\n+\n+   **Important note:** Crossbow only supports GitHub token based\n+   authentication. Although it overwrites the repository urls provided with ssh\n+   protocol, it's advisable to use the HTTPS repository URLs.\n+\n+4. `Create a Personal Access Token`_\n+\n+5. Locally export the token as an environment variable:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      export CROSSBOW_GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>\n+\n+   ..\n+\n+      or pass as an argument to the CLI script ``--github-token``\n+\n+6. Export the previously created GitHub token on both CI services:\n+\n+   Use ``CROSSBOW_GITHUB_TOKEN`` encrypted environment variable. You can\n+   set them at the following URLs, where ``ghuser`` is the GitHub\n+   username and ``ghrepo`` is the GitHub repository name (typically\n+   ``crossbow``):\n+\n+   -  TravisCI: ``https://travis-ci.org/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/settings``\n+   -  Appveyor:\n+      ``https://ci.appveyor.com/project/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/settings/environment``\n+   -  CircleCI:\n+      ``https://circleci.com/gh/<ghuser>/<ghrepo>/edit#env-vars``\n+\n+   On Appveyor check the ``skip branches without appveyor.yml`` checkbox\n+   on the web UI under crossbow repository\u2019s settings.\n+\n+7. Install Python 3.6:\n+\n+   Miniconda is preferred, see installation instructions:\n+   https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html\n+\n+8. Install the python dependencies for the script:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      conda install -c conda-forge -y \\\n+          jinja2 \\\n+          pygit2 \\\n+          click \\\n+          ruamel.yaml \\\n+          setuptools_scm \\\n+          github3.py \\\n+          python-gnupg \\\n+          toolz \\\n+          jira\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      # pygit2 requires libgit2: http://www.pygit2.org/install.html\n+      pip install \\\n+          jinja2 \\\n+          pygit2 \\\n+          click \\\n+          ruamel.yaml \\\n+          setuptools_scm \\\n+          github3.py \\\n+          python-gnupg \\\n+          toolz \\\n+          jira\n+\n+9. Try running it:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      $ python crossbow.py --help\n+\n+Usage\n+-----\n+\n+The script does the following:\n+\n+1. Detects the current repository, thus supports forks. The following\n+   snippet will build kszucs\u2019s fork instead of the upstream apache/arrow\n+   repository.\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      $ git clone https://github.com/kszucs/arrow\n+      $ git clone https://github.com/kszucs/crossbow\n+\n+      $ cd arrow/dev/tasks\n+      $ python crossbow.py submit conda-win conda-linux conda-osx\n+\n+2. Gets the HEAD commit of the currently checked out branch and\n+   generates the version number based on `setuptools_scm`_. So to build\n+   a particular branch, just check out before running the script:\n+\n+   .. code:: bash\n+\n+      git checkout ARROW-<ticket number>\n+      python dev/tasks/crossbow.py submit --dry-run conda-linux conda-osx\n+\n+   ..\n+\n+      Note that the arrow branch must be pushed beforehand, because the\n+      script will clone the selected branch.\n+\n+3. Reads and renders the required build configurations with the\n+   parameters substituted.\n+\n+4. Create a branch per task, prefixed with the job id. For example to\n+   build conda recipes on linux it will create a new branch:\n+   ``crossbow@build-<id>-conda-linux``.\n+\n+5. Pushes the modified branches to GitHub which triggers the builds. For\n+   authentication it uses GitHub OAuth tokens described in the install\n+   section.\n+\n+Query the build status\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. code:: bash\n+\n+   python crossbow.py status <build id / branch name>\n \n Review comment:\n   Added a note above.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n \nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
