The majority of workflows in this directory are Arrow implementation-specific and are run when changes are made which affect code relevant to that language's implementation, but other workflows worth noting are:\n+\n+* `archery.yml` - if changes are made to the Archery tool or tasks which it runs, this workflow runs some validation checks\n+* `comment_bot.yml` - triggers certain actions on the basis of text in comments:\n+\t* `@github-actions crossbow ...` - runs the specified Crossbow command\n+\t* `@github-actions autotune` - runs a number of stylers/formatters, builds some of the docs, and commits the results\n+\t* `@github-actions rebase` - rebases the PR onto the master branch\n+* `cpp_cron.yml` - runs nightly at midnight and does fuzz testing (https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz)\n+* `dev.yml` - runs any time there is activity on a PR, or a PR is merged; it runs the linter and tests that the PR can be merged\n+* `dev_pr.yml` - runs any time a PR is opened or updated; checks the formatting of the PR title, adds links to the appropriate JIRA ticket if included in the title (or adds a comment requesting the user fix this if not), and adds any relevant GitHub labels\n+\n+\n+Archery/Crossbow builds\n\nReview comment:\n       I'd prefer crossbow and explicitly state somewhere that it is a subcomponent/subtool of archery.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: github-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

In this article, we will give an overview of its main components and the relevant files and directories.\n+\n+Two files central to Arrow CI are:\n+\n+* `docker-compose.yml` - here we define docker services which can be configured using either enviroment variables, or the default values for these variables.\n+* `.env` - here we define default values to configure the services in `docker-compose.yml`\n+\n+One thing to note is the some of the services defined in `docker-compose.yml` are interdependent.  When running a services locally, you must either manually build its dependencies first, or build it via the use of `archery run ...` which automatically finds and builds dependencies.
