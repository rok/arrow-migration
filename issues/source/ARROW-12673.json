A null bit could be added to ParsedValueDesc to indicate this is a null value.\r\n   As for the callback that is actually more geared towards [ARROW-12673](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12673), which is actually the functionality I started to implement and then stumbled across [ARROW-12001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12001) and tagged that ticket in this PR.\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

I think we can add a \"missing\" bit to ParsedValueDescr. Hopefully that wouldn't slow down the conversion of non-missing values.\r\n   \r\n   If a bit is added to ParsedValueDesc would it be taken away from offset to try and keep the struct at 32bits?\r\n   \r\n   Also, this proposed change would only work for resolving [ARROW-12001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12001) and not the original intent which was essentially to allow the caller the ability to determine how rows with incorrect column counts should be handled. At a minimum I would like to be able to skip the rows and collect information about the skipped rows so it could be presented to a user saying when and where malformed rows were found. The fill in nulls or truncate rows were just simple additions I added to be able to process those rows if that was desired.\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",

Can you explain a bit more?\r\n   \r\n   I can give you my use case. I have users which upload CSV files to be analyzed. Currently if the csv is malformed an error message is immediately returned on the first error. I would like the behavior to be that on the first pass of parsing the csv any bad rows are skipped but tracked so that if no bad rows are found success but otherwise the user can be notified that not all data could be parsed and tell them all the rows which had an issue. The user then can decide on how they want to handle this situation, ie upload a fixed csv, just keep ignoring the lines or reparse the lines by having the parser \"fix\" them.\r\n   \r\n   This behavior is similar to the pandas.read_csv options error_bad_lines and warn_bad_lines\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
