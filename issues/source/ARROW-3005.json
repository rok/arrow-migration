It is the\n+product of over 4 months of development and includes [**470 resolved\n+issues**][1]. It is the largest release so far in the project's history. 90\n+individuals contributed to this release.\n+\n+See the [Install Page][2] to learn how to get the libraries for your\n+platform. The [complete changelog][3] is also available.\n+\n+We discuss some highlights from the release and other project news in this\n+post.\n+\n+## Offical Binary Packages and Packaging Automation\n+\n+One of the largest projects in this release cycle was automating our build and\n+packaging tooling to be able to easily and reproducibly create a [comprehensive\n+set of binary artifacts][4] which have been approved and released by the Arrow\n+PMC. We developed a tool called **Crossbow** which uses Appveyor and Travis CI\n+to build each of the different supported packages on all 3 platforms (Linux,\n+macOS, and Windows). As a result of our efforts, we should be able to make more\n+frequent Arrow releases. This work was led by Phillip Cloud, Kouhei Sutou, and\n+Kriszti\u00e1n Sz\u0171cs. Bravo!\n+\n+## New Programming Languages: Go, Ruby, Rust\n+\n+This release also adds 3 new programming languages to the project: Go, Ruby,\n+and Rust. Together with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python, **we now have\n+some level of support for 8 programming languages**.\n+\n+## Upcoming Roadmap\n+\n+In the coming months, we will be working to move Apache Arrow closer to a 1.0.0\n+release. We will continue to grow new features, improve performance and\n+stability, and expand support for currently supported and new programming\n+languages.\n+\n+[1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20status%20in%20(Resolved%2C%20Closed)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.10.0\n+[2]: https://arrow.apache.org/install\n+[3]: https://arrow.apache.org/release/0.10.0.html\n+[4]: https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/arrow/arrow-0.10.0/binaries\n\\ No newline at end of file\ndiff --git a/site/_release/0.10.0.md b/site/_release/0.10.0.md\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000000..1de1f94840\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/site/_release/0.10.0.md\n@@ -0,0 +1,604 @@\n+---\n+layout: default\n+title: Apache Arrow 0.10.0 Release\n+permalink: /release/0.10.0.html\n+---\n+<!--\n+{% comment %}\n+Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+contributor license agreements.
