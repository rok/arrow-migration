Those who actively develop Arrow need feedback from users on what\n+works and what doesn't. Alerting us to unexpected behavior and missing features,\n+even if you can't solve the problems yourself, help us understand and prioritize\n+work to improve the libraries.\n+\n+We use `JIRA <https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ARROW/issues>`_\n+to manage our development \"todo\" list and to maintain changelogs for releases.\n+In addition, the project's `Confluence site <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW>`_\n+has some useful higher-level views of the JIRA issues.\n+\n+To create a JIRA issue, you'll need to have an account on the ASF JIRA, which\n+you can `sign yourself up for <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa>`_.\n+The JIRA server hosts bugs and issues for multiple Apache projects. The JIRA\n+project name for Arrow is \"ARROW\".\n+\n+You don't need any special permissions on JIRA to be able to create issues.\n+Once you are more involved in the project and want to do more on JIRA, such as\n+assign yourself an issue, you will need \"Contributor\" permissions on the\n+Apache Arrow JIRA. To get this role, ask on the mailing list for a project\n+maintainer's help.\n+\n+\n+.. _jira-tips:\n+\n+Tips for using JIRA\n+===================\n+\n+Before you create a new issue, we recommend you first\n+`search <https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved>`_\n+among existing Arrow issues.\n+\n+When reporting a new issue, follow these conventions to help make sure the\n+right people see it:\n+\n+* Use the **Component** field to indicate the area of the project that your\n+  issue pertains to (for example \"Python\" or \"C++\").\n+* Also prefix the issue title with the component name in brackets, for example\n+  ``[Python] issue name`` ; this helps when navigating lists of open issues,\n+  and it also makes our changelogs more readable. Most prefixes are exactly the \n+  same as the **Component** name, with the following exceptions:\n+\n+  * **Component:** Continuous Integration \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [CI]\n+  * **Component:** Developer Tools \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [Dev]\n+  * **Component:** Documentation \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [Docs]\n+\n+* If you're reporting something that used to work in a previous version\n+  but doesn't work in the current release, you can add the \"Affects version\"\n+  field. For feature requests and other proposals, \"Affects version\" isn't\n+  appropriate.\n+\n+Project maintainers may later tweak formatting and labels to help improve their\n+visibility. They may add a \"Fix version\" to indicate that they're considering\n+it for inclusion in the next release, though adding that tag is not a\n+commitment that it will be done in the next release.\n+\n+.. _bug-report-tips:\n+\n+Tips for successful bug reports\n+================================\n+\n+No one likes having bugs in their software, and in an ideal world, all bugs\n+would get fixed as soon as they were reported. However, time and attention are\n+finite, especially in an open-source project where most contributors are\n+participating in their spare time. All contributors in Apache projects are\n+volunteers and act as individuals, even if they are contributing to the project\n+as part of their job responsibilities.\n+\n+In order for your bug to get prompt\n+attention, there are things you can do to make it easier for contributors to\n+reproduce and fix it.\n+**When you're reporting a bug, please help us understand the issue by providing,\n+to the best of your ability,**\n+\n+* **Clear, minimal steps to reproduce the issue, with as few non-Arrow\n+  dependencies as possible.** If there's a problem on reading a file, try to\n+  provide as small of an example file as possible, or code to create one.\n+  If your bug report says \"it crashes trying to read my file, but I can't\n+  share it with you,\" it's really hard for us to debug.\n+* Any relevant operating system, language, and library version information\n+* If it isn't obvious, clearly state the expected behavior and what actually\n+  happened.\n+\n+If a developer can't get a failing unit test, they won't be able to know that\n+the issue has been identified, and they won't know when it has been fixed.\n+Try to anticipate the questions you might be asked by someone working to\n+understand the issue and provide those supporting details up front.\n+\n+Good reproducible examples or minimal bug reports can be found in next tabs:\n+\n+.. tabs::\n+\n+   .. tab:: Python\n+\n+      The ``print`` method of a timestamp with timezone errors:\n+\n+      .. code-block:: python\n+\n+         import pyarrow as pa\n+\n+         a = pa.array([0], pa.timestamp('s', tz='+02:00'))\n+\n+         print(a) # representation not correct?\n+         # <pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at 0x7f834c7cb9a8>\n+         # [\n+         #  1970-01-01 00:00:00\n+         # ]\n+\n+         print(a[0])\n+         #Traceback (most recent call last):\n+         #  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n+         #  File \"pyarrow/scalar.pxi\", line 80, in pyarrow.lib.Scalar.__repr__\n+         #  File \"pyarrow/scalar.pxi\", line 463, in pyarrow.lib.TimestampScalar.as_py\n+         #  File \"pyarrow/scalar.pxi\", line 393, in pyarrow.lib._datetime_from_int\n+         #ValueError: fromutc: dt.tzinfo is not self\n+\n+   .. tab:: R\n+\n+      Error when reading a CSV file with ``col_types`` option ``\"T\"`` or ``\"t\"``:\n+\n+      .. code-block:: R\n+\n+         library(arrow)\n+         #>\n+         #> Attaching package: 'arrow'\n+         #> The following object is masked from 'package:utils':\n+         #>\n+         #>     timestamp\n+         tf <- tempfile()\n+         write.csv(data.frame(x = '2018-10-07 19:04:05.005'), tf, row.names = FALSE)\n+\n+         # successfully read in file\n+         read_csv_arrow(tf, as_data_frame = TRUE)\n+         #> # A tibble: 1 \u00d7 1\n+         #>   x\n+         #>   <dttm>\n+         #> 1 2018-10-07 20:04:05\n+\n+         # the unit here is seconds - doesn't work\n+         read_csv_arrow(\n+           tf,\n+           col_names = \"x\",\n+           col_types = \"T\",\n+           skip = 1\n+         )\n+         #> Error in `handle_csv_read_error()`:\n+         #> !

Those who actively develop Arrow need feedback from users on what\n+works and what doesn't. Alerting us to unexpected behavior and missing features,\n+even if you can't solve the problems yourself, help us understand and prioritize\n+work to improve the libraries.\n+\n+We use `JIRA <https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ARROW/issues>`_\n+to manage our development \"todo\" list and to maintain changelogs for releases.\n+In addition, the project's `Confluence site <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW>`_\n+has some useful higher-level views of the JIRA issues.\n+\n+To create a JIRA issue, you'll need to have an account on the ASF JIRA, which\n+you can `sign yourself up for <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa>`_.\n+The JIRA server hosts bugs and issues for multiple Apache projects. The JIRA\n+project name for Arrow is \"ARROW\".\n+\n+You don't need any special permissions on JIRA to be able to create issues.\n+Once you are more involved in the project and want to do more on JIRA, such as\n+assign yourself an issue, you will need \"Contributor\" permissions on the\n+Apache Arrow JIRA. To get this role, ask on the mailing list for a project\n+maintainer's help.\n+\n+\n+.. _jira-tips:\n+\n+Tips for using JIRA\n+===================\n+\n+Before you create a new issue, we recommend you first\n+`search <https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved>`_\n+among existing Arrow issues.\n+\n+When reporting a new issue, follow these conventions to help make sure the\n+right people see it:\n+\n+* Use the **Component** field to indicate the area of the project that your\n+  issue pertains to (for example \"Python\" or \"C++\").\n+* Also prefix the issue title with the component name in brackets, for example\n+  ``[Python] issue name`` ; this helps when navigating lists of open issues,\n+  and it also makes our changelogs more readable. Most prefixes are exactly the \n+  same as the **Component** name, with the following exceptions:\n+\n+  * **Component:** Continuous Integration \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [CI]\n+  * **Component:** Developer Tools \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [Dev]\n+  * **Component:** Documentation \u2014 **Summary prefix:** [Docs]\n+\n+* If you're reporting something that used to work in a previous version\n+  but doesn't work in the current release, you can add the \"Affects version\"\n+  field. For feature requests and other proposals, \"Affects version\" isn't\n+  appropriate.\n+\n+Project maintainers may later tweak formatting and labels to help improve their\n+visibility. They may add a \"Fix version\" to indicate that they're considering\n+it for inclusion in the next release, though adding that tag is not a\n+commitment that it will be done in the next release.\n+\n+.. _bug-report-tips:\n+\n+Tips for successful bug reports\n+================================\n+\n+No one likes having bugs in their software, and in an ideal world, all bugs\n+would get fixed as soon as they were reported. However, time and attention are\n+finite, especially in an open-source project where most contributors are\n+participating in their spare time. All contributors in Apache projects are\n+volunteers and act as individuals, even if they are contributing to the project\n+as part of their job responsibilities.\n+\n+In order for your bug to get prompt\n+attention, there are things you can do to make it easier for contributors to\n+reproduce and fix it.\n+**When you're reporting a bug, please help us understand the issue by providing,\n+to the best of your ability,**\n+\n+* **Clear, minimal steps to reproduce the issue, with as few non-Arrow\n+  dependencies as possible.** If there's a problem on reading a file, try to\n+  provide as small of an example file as possible, or code to create one.\n+  If your bug report says \"it crashes trying to read my file, but I can't\n+  share it with you,\" it's really hard for us to debug.\n+* Any relevant operating system, language, and library version information\n+* If it isn't obvious, clearly state the expected behavior and what actually\n+  happened.\n+\n+If a developer can't get a failing unit test, they won't be able to know that\n+the issue has been identified, and they won't know when it has been fixed.\n+Try to anticipate the questions you might be asked by someone working to\n+understand the issue and provide those supporting details up front.\n+\n+Good reproducible examples or minimal bug reports can be found in next tabs:\n+\n+.. tabs::\n+\n+   .. tab:: Python\n+\n+      The ``print`` method of a timestamp with timezone errors:\n+\n+      .. code-block:: python\n+\n+         import pyarrow as pa\n+\n+         a = pa.array([0], pa.timestamp('s', tz='+02:00'))\n+\n+         print(a) # representation not correct?\n+         # <pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at 0x7f834c7cb9a8>\n+         # [\n+         #  1970-01-01 00:00:00\n+         # ]\n+\n+         print(a[0])\n+         #Traceback (most recent call last):\n+         #  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n+         #  File \"pyarrow/scalar.pxi\", line 80, in pyarrow.lib.Scalar.__repr__\n+         #  File \"pyarrow/scalar.pxi\", line 463, in pyarrow.lib.TimestampScalar.as_py\n+         #  File \"pyarrow/scalar.pxi\", line 393, in pyarrow.lib._datetime_from_int\n+         #ValueError: fromutc: dt.tzinfo is not self\n+\n+   .. tab:: R\n+\n+      Error when reading a CSV file with ``col_types`` option ``\"T\"`` or ``\"t\"``:\n+\n+      .. code-block:: R\n+\n+         library(arrow)\n+         #>\n+         #> Attaching package: 'arrow'\n+         #> The following object is masked from 'package:utils':\n+         #>\n+         #>     timestamp\n\nReview comment:\n       ```suggestion\r\n            library(arrow, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\n   ```\r\n   Just tidying up a bit of extra unnecessary output.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nThis is an automated message from the Apache Git Service.\nTo respond to the message, please log on to GitHub and use the\nURL above to go to the specific comment.\n\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: github-unsubscribe@arrow.apache.org\n\nFor queries about this service, please contact Infrastructure at:\nusers@infra.apache.org\n",
