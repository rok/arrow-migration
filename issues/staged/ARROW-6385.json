Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nxxh3 is a new hash algorithm by Yann Collet that claims excellent speed on both small/tiny and large keys. It has accelerated paths for x86 SSE2, AVX and ARM NEON. It also has excellent hash quality.\r\nhttps://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html\r\n\r\nPerhaps this can replace our current complex strategy involving a custom tiny string hashing implementation, a HW CRC32-based path where available for large strings, and a murmurhash2 fallback.",
