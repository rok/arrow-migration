        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8213](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8213). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nEven after the previous PRs related to local paths (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6643, https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6655), I don't think the user experience optimal in case you are working with local files, and pass a wrong, non-existent path (eg due to a typo).\r\n\r\nCurrently, you get this error:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> dataset = ds.dataset(\"data_with_typo.parquet\", format=\"parquet\")\r\n...\r\nArrowInvalid: URI has empty scheme: 'data_with_typo.parquet'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere \"URI has empty scheme\" is rather confusing for the user in case of a non-existent path.  I think ideally we should raise a \"No such file or directory\" error.\r\n\r\nI am not fully sure what the best solution is, as `FileSystem.from_uri` can also give other errors that we do want to propagate to the user. \r\nThe most straightforward that I am now thinking of is checking if \"URI has empty scheme\" is in the error message, and then rewording it, but that's not very clean ..",
