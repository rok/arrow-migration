Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThings like `mutate(table, x_norm = x / mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))` could be supported for queries on Table/RecordBatch (but not yet on Dataset), but even so there are lots of gotchas, such as order of evaluation when building up a lazy query (i.e. evaluating aggregation before or after a filter expression that may change the value of the aggregation result).",
