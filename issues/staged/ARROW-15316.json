Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-15173 [PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12062/files) we added backwards compatibly to pointers between R and Python where we use `external_pointer_addr_double()` with old python versions. We could take a number of the blocks like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n if (pyarrow_version() >= pyarrow_version_pointers_changed) {\r\n    x$`_export_to_c`(schema_ptr)\r\n  } else {\r\n    x$`_export_to_c`(external_pointer_addr_double(schema_ptr))\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nx$`_export_to_c`(backwards_compatible_pointer(schema_ptr))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `backwards_compatible_pointer` including the if/else",
