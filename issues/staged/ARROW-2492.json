Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf you mistype `pyarrow.Array` instead of `pyarrow.array` you get a segmentation fault on some functions. We should also take care of these segmentation faults but also should prevent the user from calling the constructor again in this fashion.",
