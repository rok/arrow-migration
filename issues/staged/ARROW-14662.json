Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/11657): when building a combined gRPC/Flight service, care must be taken not to link gRPC twice on accident. This is noted briefly in the [docstring](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3e554c3703557b422fd762fe9c3844e514b32149/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.h#L152-L159) but we should be more detailed and perhaps add prose documentation. We should also note this in the [example](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3e554c3703557b422fd762fe9c3844e514b32149/cpp/examples/arrow/flight_grpc_example.cc).",

That's rather a pain and it may be easier to just build Arrow from source\u2026"
