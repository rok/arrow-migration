        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7226](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7226). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was just trying this with the example found in the pyarrow docs at <http://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/json.html>\r\n\r\nThe documented example does not work. Is this related to this issue, or is it another matter?\r\n\r\nIt says to load the following JSON file:\r\n\r\n`{\"a\": [1, 2], \"b\": {\"c\": true, \"d\": \"1991-02-03\"`}}\r\n `{\"a\": [3, 4, 5], \"b\": {\"c\": false, \"d\": \"2019-04-01\"`}}\r\n\r\nI fixed this to make it valid JSON (It is valid [JSON Lines\\|[http://jsonlines.org/]], but that's another issue):\r\n\r\n`[{\"a\": [1, 2], \"b\": {\"c\": true, \"d\": \"1991-02-03\"`,}}\r\n `{\"a\": [3, 4, 5], \"b\": {\"c\": false, \"d\": \"2019-04-01\"`]}}\r\n\r\nThen reading the JSON from a file called `my_data.json`:\r\n\r\n`from pyarrow import json`\r\n `table = json.read_json(\"my_data.json\")`\r\n\r\nGives the following error:\r\n```java\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------}}\r\n ArrowInvalid Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n <ipython-input-69-f974c21f0941> in <module>()\r\n 1 from pyarrow import json\r\n ----> 2 table = json.read_json('test.json')\r\n~/.local/share/virtualenvs/parquet-ifRxINoC/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/_json.pyx in pyarrow._json.read_json()\r\n~/.local/share/virtualenvs/parquet-ifRxINoC/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/error.pxi in pyarrow.lib.check_status()\r\nArrowInvalid: JSON parse error: A column changed from object to array\r\n```",

So that is the reason the documentation shows the example using that format."
