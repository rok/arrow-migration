        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6205](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6205). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen including arrow/io/interfaces.h from a .cu source file (compiled with nvcc, the CUDA compiler), we get warnings like the following:\r\n\r\n`[6/58] Building CUDA obje.../csv/csv_reader_impl.cu.`\r\n`arrow/install/include/arrow/io/interfaces.h(195): warning: attribute does not apply to any entity`\r\n\r\nThis example is from compiling [libcudf\\|[https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf].]\u00a0libcudf installs these headers and includes them. This is a problem for libraries like libcudf which treat\u00a0warnings as errors.\r\n\r\nThere is a simple fix (I will submit a PR): change this code in\u00a0interfaces.h:\r\n\r\n\r\n`// TODO(kszucs): remove this after 0.13`\r\n`#ifndef _MSC_VER`\r\n`using WriteableFile ARROW_DEPRECATED(\"Use WritableFile\") = WritableFile;`\r\n`using ReadableFileInterface ARROW_DEPRECATED(\"Use RandomAccessFile\") = RandomAccessFile;`\r\n`#else``// MSVC does not like using ARROW_DEPRECATED with using declarations``using WriteableFile = WritableFile;`\r\n`using ReadableFileInterface = RandomAccessFile;`\r\n`#endif`\r\n\u00a0\r\nJust change the ifndef to:\r\n`#if not defined(_MSC_VER) && not defined(__CUDACC__)`\r\nThis fix should have no impact on other compilers.",
