        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15871](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15871). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the `ParquetDataset` API itself still defaults to the legacy implementation (`parquet.read_table` already defaults to the new) and also still supports some keywords that won't be supported with the new implementation. \r\n\r\nSo if we want to remove the old implementation at some point (ARROW-15868), we should start deprecating those options, and also start defaulting to the new implementation when possible.",
