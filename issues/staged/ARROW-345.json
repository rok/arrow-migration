Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe runtime linking to libhdfs assumes a Linux (\"libhdfs.so\") or Windows (\"hdfs.dll\") name:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/io/libhdfs_shim.cc#L347\n\nThe Mac name is \"libhdfs.dylib\". I recommend making the logic to find libhdfs similar to the logic that finds libjvm.\n\nI can submit a patch if desired.",
