Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe code I wrote in `parquet_arrow` was heavily relying on this fact. As in that case we are ok with having a lot of wastage (as we resize in both directions very often), we should provide the user with a choice.\n\nI would by default shrink down on a smaller size as this is the thing a user probably expects.",
