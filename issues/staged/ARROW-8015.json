        "title": "[Python] Build 0.16.0 wheel install for Windows + Python 3.5 and publish to PyPI",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8015](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8015). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'd like to help getting `pyarrow==0.16.0` released for Windows Python 3.5.\r\n I have seen the issue here: <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Ursa-Labs/crossbow/builds/27848124>\r\n I'm not familiar with your release build procedure, but I have been trying to follow <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/python.rst#building-on-windows>\r\n Note that I have replaced:\r\n {{conda create -y -n pyarrow-dev -c conda-forge ^\r\n --file arrow\\ci\\conda_env_cpp.yml ^\r\n --file arrow\\ci\\conda_env_python.yml ^\r\n --file arrow\\ci\\conda_env_gandiva.yml ^\r\n python=3.7}}\r\n with\r\n {{conda create -y -n pyarrow-dev -c conda-forge ^\r\n --file arrow\\ci\\conda_env_cpp.yml ^\r\n --file arrow\\ci\\conda_env_python.yml ^\r\n --file arrow\\ci\\conda_env_gandiva.yml ^\r\n python=3.5}}\r\n I also had to update `Cython` manually and that `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` seemed to do nothing, so I tried doing `pip wheel -w dist .` and this successfully built a wheel file for me.\r\n\r\nI understand that `ursabot` is down, but when it comes back could you retry building the missing wheel? It is possible that this dependency issue is already resolved.\r\n\r\nIf I am wrong about the build procedure please let me know, I'm really unfamiliar with Windows development and your build procedure.",

It would be good to run all the unit tests on Windows on Python 3.5 to make sure something isn't broken there. I can't look at it today but if someone else with a properly configured Windows VM or machine can kick the tires and provide a wheel someone with write access to PyPI can upload it"
