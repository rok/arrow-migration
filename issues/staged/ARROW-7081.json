Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParquet files are very opaque, and it'd be handy to have an easy way to introspect them. Functions exist for loading them as a table, but information about row group level metadata and data page compression is hidden. Ideally, every structure from https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/#file-format could be examined in this fashion.",
