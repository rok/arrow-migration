Sometimes the wrong values show up 8 hours ahead of the expected values, and sometimes they show up 8 hours behind.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe test config in\u00a0_pom.xml_\u00a0sets the system property\u00a0_user.timezone_\u00a0to UTC. In theory this should remove the system timezone as a factor in test results, but it doesn't affect the results one way or the other. This reminds me that timezone handling is always more complicated than you think it is. :)\r\n\r\nI can fix the errors in\u00a0JdbcToArrowDataTypesTest by changing the Calendar passed to\u00a0_JdbcToArrow.sqlToArrow()_ from\u00a0_Calendar.getInstance()_\u00a0to\u00a0_JdbcToArrowUtils.getUtcCalendar()_ but it doesn't fix other errors.\r\n\r\nContinuing to try other possible solutions...\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
