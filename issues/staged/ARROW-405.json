Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe user's Hadoop distribution may not have `hdfs.h` in the expected location. If `$HADOOP_HOME` is set, but hdfs.h is not found, we can safely fall back to the vendored one because the libhdfs API has been reasonably stable over time. ",
