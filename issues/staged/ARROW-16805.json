Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using the \\{arrow} package, R crashes as soon as a dplyr verb is used on a parquet object. This does not happen on Windows computers, but I have reproduced it using two separate MacBook Pros with an Apple M1 chip. Crash happens both with RStudio and running R in the command line.\r\n\r\nThe reprex below is based on the vignette for \\{arrow}, available at <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/:>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`library(arrow)`\r\n\r\n`library(dplyr)`\r\n\r\n`write_parquet(starwars, sink = 'sw_parquet')`\r\n\r\n`sw <- read_parquet(file = 'sw_parquet', as_data_frame = FALSE)`\r\n\r\n`result <- sw %>%`\r\n`\u00a0 filter(homeworld == \"Tatooine\")`",
