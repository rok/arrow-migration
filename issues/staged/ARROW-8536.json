        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8536](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8536). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using Arrow 0.17.0 as a dependency, it is likely that you will get the error \"Failed to locate format/Flight.proto in any parent directory\". This is caused by the custom build script in the arrow-flight crate, which expects to find a \"format/Flight.proto\" file in a parent directory. This works when building the crate from within the Arrow source tree, but unfortunately doesn't work for the published crate, since the Flight.proto file was not published as part of the crate.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to create a \"format\" directory in the root of your file system (or at least at a higher level than where cargo is building code) and place the Flight.proto file there (making sure to use the 0.17.0 version, which can be found in the source release [1]).\r\n\r\n\u00a0[1] <https://github.com/apache/arrow/releases/tag/apache-arrow-0.17.0>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Otherwise we'd have to copy it into the flight crate's source. If we check it in, we could abort the build in `build.rs` if the file is not found.\r\n\r\nDo you think that could work?\u00a0"
