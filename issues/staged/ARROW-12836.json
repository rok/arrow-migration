Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNewer versions of ibm i have\u00a0CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR set to\u00a0powerpc or powerpc64. Hence in the current release ARROW_CPU_FLAG\u00a0 defaults to\u00a0\"x86\" which makes the install fail.",
