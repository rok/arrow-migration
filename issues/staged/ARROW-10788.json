Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDoing a recursive S3 directory walk using GetFileInfo(Selector) currently lists all encountered directories serially, waiting for the results of one directory listing (or portion thereof) before launching the next one. Instead, we should use the Async APIs provided by the AWS SDK to parallelize HTTP requests as much as possible.",
