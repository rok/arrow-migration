Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn general, in other kernels, we consider binary types to be comparable (e.g. we can do sort or top_k on binary types).  Given this, min_element_wise and max_element_wise should support binary types (i.e. binary, large_binary, fixed_size_binary, string, large_string)",
