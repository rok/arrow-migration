I was only able to figure out part 2 with your note on checking what Tensorflow does.  I eventually came across this page: https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/hadoop .  Something similar or a link on the Arrow docs would also be helpful.  \n\nAlso, happy to help add to docs but if it's easy for you please go ahead.  I'll leave it to you to close the issue"
