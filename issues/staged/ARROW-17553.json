Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe grpc.Server is unexported within flight.Server ([code ref](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/9d867558b50289a159b63f74f0c26af026dbe310/go/arrow/flight/server.go#L155)); therefore, it's not possible to register additional grpc services, such as health check, reflection, on the flight.Server.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n```go\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"google.golang.org/grpc/health\"\r\n\t\"google.golang.org/grpc/health/grpc_health_v1\"\r\n\t\"google.golang.org/grpc/reflection\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\ts := flight.NewFlightServer()\r\n\r\n\t// Enable health check.\r\n\tgrpc_health_v1.RegisterHealthServer(s, health.NewServer())\r\n\r\n\t// Enable reflection for grpcurl.\r\n\treflection.Register(s)\r\n```",
