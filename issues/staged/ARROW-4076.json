Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently\u00a0[schema validation](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/758bd557584107cb336cbc3422744dacd93978af/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L900)\u00a0of\u00a0`ParquetDataset`\u00a0takes place before filtering. This may raise a `ValueError`\u00a0if the schema is different in some dataset pieces, even if these pieces would be subsequently filtered out. I think validation should happen after filtering to prevent such spurious errors:\r\n```\n\r\n--- a/pyarrow/parquet.py\t\r\n+++ b/pyarrow/parquet.py\t\r\n@@ -878,13 +878,13 @@\r\n         if split_row_groups:\r\n             raise NotImplementedError(\"split_row_groups not yet implemented\")\r\n \r\n-        if validate_schema:\r\n-            self.validate_schemas()\r\n-\r\n         if filters is not None:\r\n             filters = _check_filters(filters)\r\n             self._filter(filters)\r\n \r\n+        if validate_schema:\r\n+            self.validate_schemas()\r\n+\r\n     def validate_schemas(self):\r\n         open_file = self._get_open_file_func()\r\n```",
