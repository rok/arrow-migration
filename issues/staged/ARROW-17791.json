But we found the issue, the sccache user needs explicit permission to access any bucket. We have now added this and will add any other buckets that need to be accessed in jobs that use sccache.\r\n\r\nSuccessful run here: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/actions/runs/3094438413/jobs/5047216106"
