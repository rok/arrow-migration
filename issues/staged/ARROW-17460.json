Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen you register a UDF, you get a warning if there already is a function with that name. This can be helpful, but it's a nuisance if you're running a script more than once interactively. I encountered this while working in an R Markdown document for a demo: the second time I rendered the doc in my R session, the warning was printed in the rendered document. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could determine that the UDF being registered is the same as the one that's already there and not warn in that case.",
