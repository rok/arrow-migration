Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11350 moved ThreadIndexer to a header file to allow usage from the join node and incremented its capacity.
