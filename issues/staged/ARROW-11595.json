Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/1877315066#step:6:2818\r\n\r\nComparison kernels generate an output bitmap for all array values, including those masked by a null bit. This should be fine since the indeterminate bits are also masked in the output but valgrind still triggers on the branching in GenerateBitsUnrolled.",
