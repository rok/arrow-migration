Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment pyarrow doesn't provide any way to leverage the query execution engine that the C++ layer provides. The goal is to allow a minimal implementation (unexposed to end users) that permits to create an exec plan with multiple inputs and that produces a single output. In between. It should allow to inject as intermediate steps one of the nodes to perform data manipulation.",
