Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLet's make a test to validate whether we can use buildkite on our own flows, which adds a lot of options in architectures and environments that we can test stuff on.\r\n\r\nGoal: validate that we can use buildkite on the rust builds.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n1. pipeline starts when a PR is made\n1. result is sent back to github and users can access its logs\n1. we can use caches (e.g. <https://github.com/danthorpe/cache-buildkite-plugin> )\n1. we can actually run the builds\n1. we can limit the builds to only be triggered when certain parts of the repo change (i.e. not run when only C++ code changed)\n   \n   \u00a0",

I was also able to address the caching / artifacts, which unblocks this.\r\n\r\nI have pushed the latest version to github. `[~kszucs]`, it assumes that there are 3 queues:\r\n \\* `docker`, any machine that can run a docker job using the docker plugin (basically can run docker)\r\n \\* `macos`, macos machine with rust installed\r\n \\* `windows`, windows machine with rust installed\r\n\r\nIf / when we have the runners, the pipeline should reproduce the same jobs that we have on github for Rust.\r\n\r\nI do not have strong opinions here, I just used the same setup that we have on github wrt to the runners. It looks as follows on my repo / account, where I have one (macos) agent: <https://buildkite.com/test-811/example/builds?branch=buildkite>\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
