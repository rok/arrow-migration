Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed in ARROW-15281 we made `__filename` a string column. In common cases, this will be inefficient if materialized. If possible, it may be better to have them be dictionary arrays.\r\n\r\nAs an example, [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12826#issuecomment-1230745059) is a user report of 10x increased memory usage caused by accidentally including these special fragment columns.",
