Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a first step for ARROW-9720, we should start with deprecating attributes/methods of `pq.ParquetDataset` that we would definitely not keep / are conflicting with the \"dataset API\". \r\n\r\nI am thinking of the `pieces` attribute (and the `ParquetDatasetPiece` class), the `partitions` attribute (and the `ParquetPartitions` class). \r\n\r\nIn addition, some of the keywords are also exposed as properties (memory_map, read_dictionary, buffer_size, fs), and could be deprecated.",

That added a `partitioning` attribute with similar information. \r\nCan you check if that gives sufficient information for your use case?\r\n\r\nNow, we should certainly better document this / mention it in the deprecation message (I worked on both changes simultaneously, but should afterwards have updated the deprecation message that an alternative exists). We should maybe also expose the `partitioning` attribute on ParquetDataset (if constructed with `use_legacy_dataset=False`), as I did for the `filesystem`/`files`/`fragments` attributes. "
