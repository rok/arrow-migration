Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen attempting to test equality of a pa.scalar to the value None in pyarrow, I receive a bus error and the process exits entirely. Carries for both string and numeric scalars, but otherwise no idea of the cause, solution, or scope, just reporting. Present on two different machines. Happy to give more details if the code below is not reproducible.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\ng = pa.scalar(\"foo\")\r\ng == None\n```\r\n```java\n\r\n# WITH OUTPUT:\r\n\r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Sep\u00a0 4 2020, 02:22:02) \r\n[Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> pa.__version__\r\n'3.0.0'\r\n>>> g = pa.scalar(\"foo\")\r\n>>> g == None\r\n[1]\u00a0 \u00a0 25176 bus error\u00a0 python\r\n```",
