Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParquetFileFormat has no state, so passing it around by shared_ptr<FileFormat> is not necessary; we could just keep a single static instance and pass raw pointers.\r\n\r\n`[~wesmckinn]` is there a case where a FileFormat might have state?",
