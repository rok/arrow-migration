        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14939](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14939). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have a problem with updating the schema in arrow::open_dataset().\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I have one parquet file with two columns (a and b) and another file with three columns (a and b and c). When I open this dataset, its schema will only detect columns a and b. Am I missing something ? From my previous experience, I already added new columns to some Parquet files which did not exist in other files and the new columns were automatically added to my schema, which was great.\r\n\r\nHereafter you will find the code to replicate my issue :\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ndf = data.frame(a= 1,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b= 2)\r\n\u00a0df_2 = data.frame(a = 2,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b = 3,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 c = 4)\r\nwrite_parquet(df, \"C:/Data/test2/df1.parquet\")\r\nwrite_parquet(df_2, \"C:/Data/test2/df2.parquet\")\r\nds <- arrow::open_dataset(sources = \"C:/Data/test2\") ; ds_cols <- data.frame(variables = ds$ schema$ names)\r\nds\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",

It's FALSE by default because (depending on how many files you have) it can be slow because it has to check all of the files, but it sounds like in your case that's what you want it to do. Or else you can provide an explicit schema that covers all of the files, if you know it."
