        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8231](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8231). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe parquet-format FileMetaData struct contains optional key value pairs with additional metadata about the schema:\r\n\r\n<https://docs.rs/parquet-format/2.6.0/src/parquet_format/parquet_format.rs.html#3821>\r\n\r\nWhen the parquet file was generated using the java avro parquet writer, this for example contains the original avro schema under the `parquet.avro.schema` or `avro.schema` keys.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this metadata was accessible through the `arrow::datatypes::Schema.metadata` field.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to implement and create a pull request for this feature.",
