        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6254](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6254). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\r\n\r\nI set up a blank rust project, added dependency `parquet = \"0.14.1\"` and ran `cargo build`. But unfortunately, it with a large error message.\r\n\r\nUse used rust nightly: `cargo 1.38.0-nightly` and `rustc 1.38.0-nightly`. It failed both on arch and ubuntu.\r\n\r\nI tried to build directly in `.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/parquet-0.14.1`\u00a0but it failed.\r\n\r\nI cloned arrow repository and tried to build in the directory `rust/parquet` and it succeeded. But as soon I moved the rust/parquet to some other location, the build failed. So my guess is that the failure has to do something with dependent modules `rust/arrow`.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue? I couldn't find any ticket for that.",
