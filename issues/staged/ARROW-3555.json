Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSometimes, it is very hard for the data consumer to know whether an object is a buffer or other objects. If we use try-catch to catch the pyarrow deserialization exception and then using `plasma_client.get_buffer`, the code is not clean.\r\nWe may leverage the metadata which is not used at all to mark the buffer data. In the client of other language, this would be simple to implement. ",
