        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13599](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13599). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently there are two types of scans:\r\n\r\n \\* Ordered scan - Yields batches in order (includes batch index and fragment index)\r\n \\* Unordered scan - Yields batches in any order (no batch index or fragment index)\r\n\r\nThere is a third type of scan (Tagged scan?  Indexed scan?) which could tag each batch with the starting row # of the batch.  Certain file types (like parquet & IPC) should be able to support this with similar performance to an unordered scan (since the # of rows is in the metadata).\r\n\r\nOther file types (like CSV) could fall back to an ordered scan or do something like a two pass approach to count the # of newlines in a file and then scan the file itself (not sure if this makes sense yet).",
