Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimilar to the `SliceableCursor` type that provides a convenience for reading Parquet from memory, I would like to propose a type to make it convenient to write Parquet to memory. \r\n\r\nThis is possible for clients to implement today, but seems common enough to want to provide for everyone to use.",
