        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11537](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11537). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe RecordBatchOptions struct seems to be limited to express the possible options that could be used to create a RecordBatch. At the time it seems that there is only one option put if in the future a new option is added the struct will have to be changed.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to change the struct RecordBatchOptions to an enum with the possible options and in the create recordbatch with options you can pass an slice with all the options.",
