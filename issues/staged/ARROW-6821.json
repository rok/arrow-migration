        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6821). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBuilding Thrift from source carries extra toolchain dependencies (bison and flex). If we check in the files produced by compiling parquet.thrift, then the EP can be simplified to only build the Thrift C++ library and not the compiler. This also results in a simpler build for third parties",
