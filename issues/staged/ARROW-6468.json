Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe adoption of xxh3 for hashing (in ARROW-6385) probably left around some specialized but unused hashing functions (e.g. CRC-based hashing, perhaps also murmurhash). We should probably remove them if no problem surfaces with xxh3.\r\n",
