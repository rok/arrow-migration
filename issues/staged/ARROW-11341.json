        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11341](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11341). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMost of the functions in Gandiva's Python Expression builder interface current accept None in their arguments, but will segfault once they are used.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow\r\nimport pyarrow.gandiva as gandiva\r\n\r\nbuilder = gandiva.TreeExprBuilder()\r\nfield = pyarrow.field('whatever', type=pyarrow.date64())\r\ndate_col = builder.make_field(field)\r\n\r\nfunc = builder.make_function('less_than_or_equal_to', [date_col, None], pyarrow.bool_())\r\n\r\ncondition = builder.make_condition(func)\r\n\r\n# Will segfault on this line:\r\ngandiva.make_filter(pyarrow.schema([field]), condition)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is just a matter of adding `not None` to the appropriate function arguments.",
