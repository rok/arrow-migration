        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6833](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6833). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have a separate nightly job that runs this on multiple R versions, but it would be nice to be able to have crossbow check this on a PR. As it turns out, the ARROW_S3 feature doesn't work with autobrew in practice--aws-sdk-cpp doesn't seem to ship static libs via Homebrew, so the autobrew packaging doesn't work, even though the formula builds and `brew audit` is clean.",
