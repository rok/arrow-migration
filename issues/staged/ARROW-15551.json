Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith gRPC 1.43.2\r\n```\n\r\n-- Checking support for TlsCredentialsOptions (gRPC >= 1.36)...\r\n-- TlsCredentialsOptions (for gRPC 1.36) not found in grpc::experimental.\r\n-- Checking support for TlsCredentialsOptions (gRPC >= 1.34)...\r\n-- TlsCredentialsOptions (for gRPC 1.34) not found in grpc::experimental.\r\n-- Checking support for TlsCredentialsOptions (gRPC >= 1.32)...\r\n-- TlsCredentialsOptions (for gRPC 1.32) not found in grpc::experimental.\r\n-- Checking support for TlsCredentialsOptions (gRPC >= 1.27)...\r\n-- TlsCredentialsOptions (for gRPC 1.27) not found in grpc::experimental.\r\n-- Found approximate gRPC version: \u00a0(ARROW_FLIGHT_REQUIRE_TLSCREDENTIALSOPTIONS=)\r\n-- A proper version of gRPC could not be found to support TlsCredentialsOptions in Arrow Flight.\r\n-- You may need a newer version of gRPC (>= 1.27), or the gRPC API has changed and Flight must be updated to match. \n```\r\nWe need to update the detection again.",
