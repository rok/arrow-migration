Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile profiling ARROW-16161, Memory allocation would sometimes appear to take up a few percent of total runtime. Especially the creating/copying of CPUMemoryManager objects seems to be more costly then then allocator calls themselves at times. It would be good to see how much different operations are affected by this (possibly even distinguish between time a Pool allocation and in the allocator itself).",
