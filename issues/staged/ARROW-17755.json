Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen the scanner is asked to pause producing we should be able to simply pause the async task scheduler.  However, the task scheduler does not have a pause capability at the moment.\r\n\r\nWhen the async task scheduler is asked to pause it should simply stop submitting new tasks.  There is no need to worry about the tasks in progress.\r\n",
