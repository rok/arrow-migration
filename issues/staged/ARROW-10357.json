        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10357](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10357). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur 2.0.0 CRAN release is held up because there is now a package with a hard dependency on arrow, and they happened to use an API that we removed in this release (wrongly assuming that no one would want to call it). To prevent future surprises, we should add a nightly (or possibly less frequently, or possibly only triggered if there's changes to R) job that runs reverse dependency checks. \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nRscript -e 'install.packages(\"revdepcheck\"); revdepcheck::revdep_check()'\r\nif ! grep -q \"no problems at all\" revdep/failures.md; then\r\n  cat revdep/failures.md\r\n  exit 1\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould be sufficient to run the checks and fail the build if any fail.",
