Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nObject columns in Pandas are currently converted to Null type columns in Arrow and they can not be written using `pyarrow.orc.write_table`. Since ORC doesn't support Null type columns we need to find the appropriate DataType for such columns and do the write.",
