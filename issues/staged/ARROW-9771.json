Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed by `[~jorgecarleitao]` and `[~houqp]` here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7880#pullrequestreview-468057624\r\n\r\nIf a predicate is a conjunction (aka AND'd) together, each of the clauses can be treated separately (e.g. a single filter expression `A > 5 And B < 4` can be broken up and each of `A > 5` and `B < 4` can be potentially pushed down different levels\r\n\r\nThe filter pushdown logic works for the following case (when `a` and `b` are are separate selections, predicate for a is pushed below the `Aggregate` in the optimized plan):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n********Original plan:\r\nSelection: #b GtEq Int64(1)\r\n  Selection: #a LtEq Int64(1)\r\n    Aggregate: groupBy=[[#a]], aggr=[[MIN(#b)]]\r\n      TableScan: test projection=None\r\n\r\n********Optimized plan:\r\nSelection: #b GtEq Int64(1)\r\n  Aggregate: groupBy=[[#a]], aggr=[[MIN(#b)]]\r\n    Selection: #a LtEq Int64(1)\r\n      TableScan: test projection=None\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut not for this when `a` and `b` are `AND`'d together\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n********Original plan:\r\nSelection: #a LtEq Int64(1) And #b GtEq Int64(1)\r\n  Aggregate: groupBy=[[#a]], aggr=[[MIN(#b)]]\r\n    TableScan: test projection=None\r\n********Optimized plan:\r\nSelection: #a LtEq Int64(1) And #b GtEq Int64(1)\r\n  Aggregate: groupBy=[[#a]], aggr=[[MIN(#b)]]\r\n    TableScan: test projection=None\r\n```\r\n",
