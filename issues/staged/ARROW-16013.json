        "title": "[C++][Python] Signed overflow when using negative stride in NumPyStridedConverter",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16013](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16013). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe calculation of the stride value passed to `CopyStridedNatural` by `NumPyStridedConverter::Visit` divides the stride value by sizeof(T), which is unsigned, without an appropriate type case. This causes `CopyStridedNatural` to access bogus indices.\r\n\r\nThis is triggered by the existing test method `test_numpy_to_pyarrow` in `test_array.py` (at `{}pa.array(np_arr[case]){`}). When using ubsan catches a signed integer overflow, otherwise it apparently does what we want, but is still undefined behavoir.\r\n\r\nAlso the existing behavoir would probably not work for data types that are not a power of 2, if such would exist (numpy docs mention a float96 can exist on some platforms, but I don't have them on x86_64)",
