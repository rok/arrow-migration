Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nJDBC meta data has a field that indicates if a column can contain null. We can make use of this information when transforming jdbc data to arrow vectors.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if the column cannot have null, there is no need to call the JDBC API for each value to check if the last value is null. \r\n\r\nThis will improve the performance of transforming JDBC data to arrow vectors.
