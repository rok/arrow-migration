Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-18285 we removed some tests that had trailing zeroes in numeric inputs (e.g., `1.2020`). This used to work in lubridate but support was removed (probably not on purpose; follow-up with lubridate is here: https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate/issues/1091 ). The behaviour still works in arrow but because our test tests \"roundtrip\" behaviour it was causing a lot of CI to fail so that specific corner case was removed. When this is resolved in lubridate, we could consider re-adding those cases.",
