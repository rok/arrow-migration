Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee e.g. https://travis-ci.org/ursa-labs/crossbow/builds/653768049#L97. According to https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/5734, there needs to be `brew untap homebrew-versions` before `brew update`, except this is happening in the Travis workflow in the setup stage, so we can't. Will need to change the travis-build config or base image upstream, or look for a different workaround.",
