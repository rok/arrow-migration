Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~xhochy]` since we added the git-archive business, I'm getting non-deterministic SHA256 checksums from the archives on GitHub, e.g.\n\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/conda-forge/arrow-cpp-feedstock/15\n\nfrom a prior passing build with the same commit hash and SHA256\n\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/wesm/arrow-cpp-feedstock/3\n\nI suggest that we drop setuptools_scm_git_archive and revert to manual versioning.
