Other readers [like {vroom}](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/05/vroom-1-0-0/#reading-multiple-files) that support reading multiple files do this at the read/open step:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nlibrary(vroom)\r\n\r\ntable <- read_csv(list_of_files, na = c(\"\", \"NA\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think that this doesn't have to be one or the other, I suspect we could support specifying it in both places, but we should implement it at the `open_dataset()` step if at all possible to match with other paradigms."
