Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-6478, we switched back to jemallox 4.x to fix a large performance regression in micro-benchmarks which appeared when bumping the vendored jemalloc version to 5.2.0.\r\n\r\nSince then, the issue was [discussed](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1621) with the jemalloc maintainers and we found out that customizing some options allowed regaining all (or most) of the performance on micro-benchmarks with 5.2.x.",
