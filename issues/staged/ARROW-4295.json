Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen Plasma evicts objects on running out of memory, it\u00a0prints log messages of the form:\r\n\r\n> There is not enough space to create this object, so evicting x\u00a0objects to free up y\u00a0bytes. The number of bytes in use (before this eviction) is z.\r\n\r\nHowever, the reported number of bytes in use (before this eviction) actually reports the number of bytes **after** the eviction. A straightforward fix is to simply replace z with (y+z).\r\n\r\n",
