Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-1347 covered ListVector to have name of the field $data$ instead of [DEFAULT]\r\nWe left FixedSizeListVector behind.\r\n\r\nAnother case is backward compatibility - if schema was created before ARROW-1347 was in place  application may still suffer from side effects as it would not be updated based on new code.",
