Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI just tried running the tests on a default build on Ubuntu 20.04 with an AMD Ryzen CPU (where presumably RDRAND can't be relied on, but I don't know if that's the underlying reason), and the tests appear to hand blocking on `std::random_device` at some point. I suppose some versions of libstdc++ will use `/dev/random` instead of `/dev/urandom` (which is a bad idea in itself).\r\n\r\nWe should probably try to minimize our usage of `std::random_device`. After all, we're not generating cryptographic keys or anything.",
