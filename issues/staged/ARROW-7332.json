        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7332](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7332). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPARQUET_THROW_NOT_OK throws a ParquetStatusException, which contains a full Status rather than just an error string. These could be caught explicitly in PARQUET_CATCH_NOT_OK and the original status returned rather than creating a new status:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  } catch (const ::parquet::ParquetStatusException& e) { \\\r\n    return e.status(); \\\r\n  } catch (const ::parquet::ParquetException& e) { \\\r\n    return Status::IOError(e.what()) \\\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will retain the original StatusCode rather than overwriting it with IOError.",
