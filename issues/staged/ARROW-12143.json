Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, if an R test hangs, then it is very difficult to determine what the root cause is because it just outputs \"checking tests\".\u00a0 It also slows down the CI pipeline because it doesn't time out for 6 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm hoping we can instead kill the test after some unreasonable amount of time has passed and dump whatever output has been generated so far.",
