Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi\r\n\r\nAs a part of my thesis, I want to create an S3 bucket on DigitalOcean (what PUC uses), and while I can write parquet files on my laptop and upload to DigitalOcean Spaces (i.e. an \"S3 + Google Drive\") from the browser or by using rclone, I could work in editing the existing code that allows to connects to Amazon S3, and  provide a function that connects to DigitalOcean/Linode/IBM/etc.\r\n\r\nThis could be done in a way that amazon URL is the default and the user could specify something like `new_s3_fun(...,  provider = \"Tencent\")` and connect to an S3 that is not Amazon.\r\n\r\nAlso, this involves the need to write more S3 documentation.",

Neal reminded me about https://www.jaredlander.com/2021/03/analyzing-room-temperature-data/#getting-the-data which uses the following setup (you'll need to sub out these values for your values, of course):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nspace <- arrow::S3FileSystem$create(\r\n  access_key=Sys.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),\r\n  secret_key=Sys.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),\r\n  scheme=\"https\",\r\n  endpoint_override=glue::glue(\"{Sys.getenv('DO_REGION')}.{Sys.getenv('DO_BASE')}\")\r\n)\r\nspace\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this not work for you? Do you have the code that you're using that isn't working?\r\n"
