Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOnce reached end of iteration, calling next on ParquetIterator will result in an error. This is inconvenient in two ways:\r\n- when shared between multiple threads, only one of the thread will be able to terminate without error\n- sender for response_rx cannot terminate the iteration early and free up resources, instead, it needs to always wait for signal from request_tx before closing up the connection",
