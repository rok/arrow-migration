Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGiven a C++ std::shared_ptr<RecordBatch>, retrieve it in java as a VectorSchemaRoot class. Gandiva already offer a similar facility but with raw buffers. It would be convenient if users could call C++ that yields RecordBatch and retrieve it in a seamless fashion.\r\n\r\nThis would remove one roadblock of using C++ dataset facility in Java.",
