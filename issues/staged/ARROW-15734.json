Versions 2 and 3 may just have been built using different versions of pkgdown or different configurations (we don't rebuild old versions of docs, we just host the archived versions).\r\n\r\nHmm, one of the things which, [according to the docs](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html), upgrading Bootstrap can interfere with is custom CSS, so that may be what is happening here.  I'm not sure exactly how the CSS for the nav bar is controlled, but I have built it locally myself previously and ended up with the black version, so it may be that other changes would be required to successfully upgrade here."
