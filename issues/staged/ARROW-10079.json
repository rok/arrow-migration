Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`count_set_bits` and `count_set_bits_offset` currently use a lookup table for each byte. I'm thinking it should be more efficient to iterate the data in larger chunks and use the builtin `count_ones` function.",
