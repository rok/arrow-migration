Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince we are likely going to be using a patched jemalloc, we probably should not support using jemalloc with any other version, or relying on system packages. jemalloc would therefore always be built together with Arrow if `ARROW_JEMALLOC` is on\r\n\r\nFor this reason I believe we should vendor the code at the pinned commit as with Redis and other projects: https://github.com/antirez/redis/tree/unstable/deps",
