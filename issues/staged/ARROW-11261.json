Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\narrow compressed files, such as one produced with R arrow::write_feather are much smaller than those created with write_ipc_stream.\r\n\r\nAnd of course on the web it makes a big difference.\r\n\r\nBut i can't properly read such 'feather' files with Arrow js (arrow.Table.from).\r\n\r\nFor instance dictionary values are not properly decoded",
