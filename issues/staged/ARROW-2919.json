Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, listing empty HDFS file\u00a0returns \"list directory failed\" which doesn't help much for users. An improvement would be like \"list $file_path failed: No such or file directory\", the error message that HDFS command \"hadoop fs -ls\" returns on empty file.",
