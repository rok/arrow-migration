Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere were a couple patches related to 64-byte alignment for tensor messages at the beginning of April that I've been concerned about: \r\n\r\nARROW-2308: https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/26bc4ab5a31e3430e1d545068e5a5a5ba5bc7a22#diff-bf4eb56f3cb806c32f60ae67afbb1bf0\r\n\r\nARROW-2437: https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/0f87c12d45250ee763ac8c43b7e57e8f06a0b9f3\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the alignment issue should be encapsulated in the protocol if possible; to have argument that toggles whether the file is to be aligned after reading the metadata seems wrong to me. The bytes written for alignment purposes should be accounted for in the metadata size prefix in the IPC message.\r\n\r\nSince there are unit tests for this, I'd like to take a look and see if I can improve this without breaking the tests.",
