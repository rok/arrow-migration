Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBoth the legacy filesystems (`pyarrow.filesytem` as the serialization functionality was deprecated in pyarrow 2.0.0, and uses DeprecationWarnings. In a next step (before actually removing), we can turn them into FutureWarnings, to make them more visisble (always shown by default in contrast to DeprecationWarnings)",
