        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-387). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe buffer being read from in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/io/memory.h should ideally retain shared ownership of the \"parent\" buffer. This will prevent memory from being freed by a Buffer's destructor before other Buffers are done using it",
