Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe **sign** function implementation for unsigned integers returns the result of a boolean expression because when casted to an integer it corresponds to the expected value (0 or 1). To make the function more clear, we should be explicit with the return values similar to the other **sign** kernels.",
