Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome applications may want to use gRPC in conjunction with Flight to benefit from gRPC's tooling. This is fairly straightforward to do in Java, not possible in Python, and possible in gRPC but needs some demonstration.\r\n\r\nThis may also be good to have as a cookbook example.",
