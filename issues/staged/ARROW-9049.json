Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDictionary types require a signed integer index type.  Today there is a DCHECK that this is the case in the constructor.  \r\n\r\nWhen reading data from an unknown source it is possible due to corruption (or user error) that the dictionary index type is not signed. We should add a method that checks for signedness and use that at all system boundaries to validate input data.",
