        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17970](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17970). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using the CSVReader for a value with inner quotations escaped by backslashes the value is incorrectly parsed.\r\n\r\nWhen I use\r\n```java\n\r\ntable = Arrow::MemoryMappedInputStream.open(file.path) do |input|\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Arrow::CSVReader.new(input, options).read\r\nend\n```\r\nOn a row such as\r\n```java\n\r\n\"Some value\", \"Another \\\"value\\\" quotations\", \"Last value\"\n```\r\nIt outputs\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nSome value\r\nAnother value\" quotations\"\r\nLast value\n```\r\nWhen my expected output is\r\n```java\n\r\nSome value\r\nAnother \"value\" quotations\r\nLast value\n```\r\nI've tried plenty of different options in different combinations, mainly the three below ones though. With, without and in different combinations and values.\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\noptions.quoted = true\r\noptions.double_quoted = false (tried with true)\r\noptions.escape_character = 92\n```\r\nI assume this is a bug.",
