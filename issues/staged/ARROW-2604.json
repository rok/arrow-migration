Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would have expected that this is a very typical use case but at the moment I only see code that first needs to fill a `VarCharHolder before passing it to VarCharVecttor.set()`. We could also provide this as a convenience overload.\r\n\r\nCorrect me please if I missed a convenience feature. I'm still new to the Java side.",

A `Text` instance can easily be made from a string using the constructor `Text(String string)`"
