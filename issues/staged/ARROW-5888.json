Expected behavior would be that the timezone is properly reconstructed\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nschema = pa.schema(\r\n    [\r\n        pa.field(\"no_tz\", pa.timestamp('us')),\r\n        pa.field(\"no_tz\", pa.timestamp('us', tz=\"UTC\")),\r\n        pa.field(\"no_tz\", pa.timestamp('us', tz=\"Europe/Berlin\")),\r\n]\r\n)\r\nbuf = pa.BufferOutputStream()\r\npq.write_metadata(\r\n    schema,\r\n    buf,\r\n    coerce_timestamps=\"us\"\r\n)\r\n\r\npq_bytes = buf.getvalue().to_pybytes()\r\nreader = pa.BufferReader(pq_bytes)\r\nparquet_file = pq.ParquetFile(reader)\r\nparquet_file.schema.to_arrow_schema()\r\n#\u00a0Output:\r\n# no_tz: timestamp[us]\r\n# utc: timestamp[us, tz=UTC]\r\n# europe: timestamp[us, tz=UTC]\r\n```",

So to roundtrip timezones, we probably need to add arrow-specific metadata to the parquet schema (in a similar way as spark does).\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion about this in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4421. `[~tpboudreau]` do you know if there was already an issue about this?
