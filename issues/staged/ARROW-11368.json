Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMode and quantile kernels support returning multiple values and always return array to hold multiple values. If only one value is required, an array of size 1 is returned. It's better to return a scalar instead in this case.",
