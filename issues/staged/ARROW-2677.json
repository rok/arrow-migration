Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems like in the python/pyarrow/_parquet.pyx file there's a check for the supported compression scheme:\r\n```Java\n\r\ncdef int check_compression_name(name) except -1:\r\n    if name.upper() not in ['NONE', 'SNAPPY', 'GZIP', 'LZO', 'BROTLI', 'LZ4']:\r\n        raise ArrowException(\"Unsupported compression: \" + name)\r\n    return 0\n```\r\nwhich does not include ZSTD (Zstandard).\u00a0 From my understanding it should be supported in the underlying c++ library already.\u00a0 Is it possible to add that support?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
