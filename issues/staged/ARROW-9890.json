        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9890](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9890). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am using the default macOS build of R arrow 1.0.1 (R 4.0.2) and it doesn't support zstandard/zstd for compression:\r\n```r\n\r\n> arrow::write_parquet(cars, '~/Downloads/cars.parquet', compression = 'zstd')\r\nError in parquet___arrow___FileWriter__WriteTable(self, table, chunk_size) : \r\n  NotImplemented: ZSTD codec support not built\r\n> arrow::codec_is_available('zstd')\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n```\r\nLike ARROW-6960 which adds the lz4/zstd support in Windows, It'd be a great to have the zstd support by default in macOS as well.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I have the right knowledge to add such support, but let me know how I can help. Thank you for making this great package!",
