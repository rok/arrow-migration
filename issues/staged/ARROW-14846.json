It uses _train_formats()_ and _guess_formats()_ functions, among others.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n> unique(guess_formats(example_string, orders, locale))\r\n[1] \"Arrow bbq party on %A in the year %H%M! =)\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Arrow bbq party on %A in the year %M%S! =)\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n[3] \"Arrow bbq party on %A in the year %Y! =)\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Arrow bbq party on Friday in the year %H%M! =)\"\r\n[5] \"Arrow bbq party on Friday in the year %M%S! =)\" \"Arrow bbq party on Friday in the year %Y! =)\" \u00a0\r\n```\r\n**2.** Using _format()_ to insert the date information into an example string using the selected format from point 1.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n> possible_formats <- unique(guess_formats(example_string, orders, locale))\r\n\r\n> format(D, possible_formats[3])\r\n[1] \"Arrow bbq party on Tuesday in the year 2022! =)\" \u00a0 \"Arrow bbq party on Wednesday in the year 2023! =)\"\r\n[3] \"Arrow bbq party on Friday in the year 2024! =)\"\u00a0\r\n```\r\nBoth of these steps would have to be implemented to be able to define the stamp function (there are no existing Arrow functions that I could use, if I am not mistaken). And none of these two are trivial to implement on the R side and not needed on the C++ side.\r\n\r\nIn Python I can\u2019t find similar function to _guess_formats()_."

See also\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15666. Maybe we should add a separate ticket for `guess_formats` and see if it would be a reasonable approach to do the \"guessing\" part in R. `guess_formats` is also being used in `lubridate::parse_date_time()`. For the `parse_date_time()` binding I opted for a workaround. "
