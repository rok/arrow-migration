        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-711](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-711). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that linkers have diverging semantics around visibility when using the `extern template` declaration (see linker errors in https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/build/1.0.841). Since the only thing impacted right now is the `NumericArray<T>` constructor, removing these doesn't seem too onerous. I ran the existing benchmarks and looked at the library sizes before and after, and there doesn't appear to be a meaningful difference. ",
