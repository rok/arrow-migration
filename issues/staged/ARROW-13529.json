Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/go/arrow/ipc/writer.go#L441>\r\n\r\nIn the `*arrow.StringType` case, in the `needTruncate` code path (happens when writing a `record.NewSlice`), a reference to `data.buffers[2]` is appended to the payload body. It gets `Release`'d [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/122985841dcedd13bee5388cf5cb887f75cb4527/go/arrow/ipc/file_writer.go#L247) without any `Retain`.\r\n\r\nThe code for the `FixedWidthType` and `BinaryType` cases is similar.\r\n\r\nThe attached code reproduces the issue.",
