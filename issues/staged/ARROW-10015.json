        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10015](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10015). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, our aggregations are made in a simple loop. However, as described [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/packed_simd/perf-guide/vert-hor-ops.html), horizontal operations can also be SIMDed, reports of 2.7x speedups.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this improvement is to support SIMD for the \"sum\", for primitive types.\r\n\r\nThe code to modify is in [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/rust/arrow/src/compute/kernels/aggregate.rs). A good indication that this issue is completed is when the script\r\n\r\n`cargo bench --bench aggregate_kernels && cargo bench --bench aggregate_kernels --features simd`\r\n\r\nyields a speed-up.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
