Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nReadRecordBatchAsync crashes at the end of a stream when messageLength is 0. \"0\" indicates the end of the stream, so we should just return null. The call Flatbug.Message.GetRootAsMessage seems to be crashing. The fix is simple and safe. I'll have a PR up soon.\u00a0",
