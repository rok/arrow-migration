        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16701](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16701). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow that we have `to_duckdb()` and `to_arrow()` is it possible to wrap those and allow someone to insert arbitrary SQL into a dplyr query?\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nsql <- function(data, sql) {\r\n   tbl <- to_duckdb(data)\r\n   res <- DBI::dbSendQuery(dbplyr::remote_con(.data), sql, arrow = TRUE)\r\n\r\n  duckdb::duckdb_fetch_record_batch(res)\r\n}\r\n\r\nds %>%\r\n  filter(year > 2020) %>% \r\n  sql(\"SELECT tip_amount, fare_amount, total_amount FROM \") %>%\r\n  compute()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis won't work totally, but is vaguely what we're looking for.\r\n\r\nOne part that we need to think about is how to deal with the `from` clause, a few possibilities:\r\n\r\n- ibis does this by making you \"name\" the table before doing sql so you can FROM explicitly\n- though maybe you could get away with FROM . like it is a magrittr thing and sub that\n- empty string, and we add it in based on the lazy_tbl object\n  \n  Possibly related prior art: https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/build_sql.html (though the name isn't perfect IMO, and I think this is more geared towards package developers than end users?)",

We can do this today with duckdb, so we should try that \u2014 but in principle we should be able to use it with any backend that accepts sql + could speak arrow"
