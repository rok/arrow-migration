Homebrew support will be useful widely."

I'll change the JIRA ticket title.\r\n\r\nbtw, AFAIK, main reasons that Arrow formula had been removed are 1) the formula was broken and outdated and 2) it has build options. Mike also says build options in formulas on homebrew-core should be removed or we, Apache Arrow community, should manage the options for formula in a tap.\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/31510"
