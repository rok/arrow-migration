Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe're likely to have distinct groups of users - those who are mainly performing tasks like reading/writing data and using dplyr syntax to query data, and then those who are performing more in-depth data engineering tasks such as ensuring successful interfacing with databases via schemas etc - content should be organised with this in mind",
