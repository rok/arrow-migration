        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7264](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7264). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `RangeEqualsVisitor`\u00a0generally only checks type once and keep the result to avoid repeated type checking, see\r\n```java\n\r\ntypeCompareResult = left.getField().getType().equals(right.getField().getType());\r\n```\r\nThis only compares `ArrowType` and for complex type, this may cause unexpected behavior, for example `List<Int>`\u00a0and `List<BigInt>`\u00a0would be type equals which not consider their child field.\r\n\r\nWe should compare Field here instead and to make it more extendable, we use `TypeEqualsVisitor`\u00a0to compare Field, in this way, one could choose whether checks names or metadata either.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso provide a test for ListVector to validate this change.",
