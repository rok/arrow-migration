Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `array()` factory takes `...` and this makes this harder than it needs to be because then we have two competing views on type:\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0- `vctrs::vec_c(.ptype=)` which uses R specific typing system\r\n\r\n\u00a0- the arrow type\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo `array()` should really take a single thing for `data`, which may be the result of a `vctrs::vec_c(...)` if we do want R type promotion.\u00a0",
