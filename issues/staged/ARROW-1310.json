Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe don't need to reallocate the underlying offsetVector every time a variable length vector is reallocated. \n\nReallocation of offsetVector is taken care of by setSafe() function of the offsetVector. \n\nThe setSafe() function of the Variable Length Vector will decide whether to call realloc() or not. However, this should not decide whether offsetVector needs reallocation or not. When setSafe() calls offsetVector.setSafe(), the latter can decide whether to reallocate the offset vector or not.",
