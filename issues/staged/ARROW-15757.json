Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nShouldn't the missing bindings reported earlier in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11632>\u00a0be propagated higher up\u00a0[here in the parquet.py module](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L2217)?\r\nPassing \\*\\*kwargs as is the case for\u00a0`write_table`\u00a0would do the trick I think.\r\nI am finding myself stuck while using pandas.to_parquet with\u00a0`use_legacy_dataset=false`\u00a0and no way to set the\u00a0`existing_data_behavior`\u00a0flag to\u00a0`overwrite_or_ignore`\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Currently, the `**kwargs` are passed to the ParquetFileFormat write options (for parquet specific write options). \r\n\r\nThanks for raising the issue!"
