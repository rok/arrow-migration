        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-262](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-262). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe existing document\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Layout.md\n\nOnly describes the physical layout of fixed-size, variable-size, and other nested types (struct, union)\n\nMeanwhile, we have begun drafting Flatbuffers IDL for Arrow metadata:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Message.fbs\n\nI will add a document that will, to begin with:\n\n- Explain the mapping between logical types in the metadata. For example,  definitions of important data types: integers, floating point, boolean, string (UTF-8) and binary\n\n- Where relevant, describing how each logical type's physical memory is converted to metadata for messaging purposes (e.g. the `RecordBatch` concept in the IDL)\n\nWe have already begun prototype implementations in the C++ codebase (https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/src/arrow/ipc) so this will serve as implementation-agnostic documentation.\n\nSubsequently, I will make a follow up patch for discussion to hopefully address metadata shortfall between the canonical Arrow metadata and the similar metadata used by the bespoke Feather format (https://github.com/wesm/feather/blob/master/cpp/src/feather/metadata.fbs)",
