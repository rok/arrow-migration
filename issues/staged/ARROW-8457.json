Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAccording to the [specification](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/format/CDataInterface.rst) of ArrowSchema, memory format uses the native endian of the CPU. However, the test cases assume only little endian.",

Use TravisCI at https://blog.travis-ci.com/2019-11-12-multi-cpu-architecture-ibm-power-ibm-z\r\n2. Use Jenkins at https://osuosl.org/services/ibm-z/. I created an account for Arrow one year ago, but have not set up yet."
