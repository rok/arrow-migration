Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile trying to read a utf8 column with DELTA_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY encoding, pyarrow yields\r\n\r\n`OSError: Not yet implemented: Unsupported encoding.`\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have support for this encoding, since it lends itself really well to the arrow format, whereby values's encoding is equal to arrow's representation.",
