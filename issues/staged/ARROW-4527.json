Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3499\r\n\r\nCosmic, Bionic, Xenial and Stretch tasks are failing:\r\n- https://github.com/kszucs/crossbow/branches/all?query=ubuntu\n- https://github.com/kszucs/crossbow/branches/all?query=debian\n  respectively.\n  \n  We can pin clang-7 on Cosmic and Bionic, but I'm not sure what should be the strategy for Xenial and Stretch. `[~kou]` Do We need to make exceptions like with Trusty?\n",
