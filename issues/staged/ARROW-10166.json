Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we can build complex filter expressions with AND and OR, but I don't see a clear way to do negation (maybe I am missing something?). Propose adding a MakeNot function that works like MakeAnd and MakeOr. (See: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d542482bdc6bea8a449f000bdd74de8990c20015/cpp/src/gandiva/tree_expr_builder.h>).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWould be nice to also expose this in the Python interface, and whatever other interfaces might want it.",
