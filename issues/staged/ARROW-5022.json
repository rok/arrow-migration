Otherwise we'll end up with a ton of public APIs that may take a lot of energy to maintain"

Since it's kernel-specific, perhaps it can be implemented in the kernel just as well (at least for the chunked array variant)."

We added scalar aggregation over scalars in ARROW-9056, and for hash aggregation, I don't think it makes sense to support anything but arrays. So going forward we should just make sure to support scalars and arrays in scalar aggregation."
