Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince I don't use macOS as a primary OS I don't have all-the-things set up for usual Arrow development. A guide for Homebrew users to be able to run the release verification starting from very little pre-installed beyond Xcode would be nice",
