Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, we use\u00a0`next_batch -> Result<Option<RecordBatch>>` to iterate over batches. However, this is very similar to the iterator pattern that Rust offers.\r\n\r\nThis issue concerns migrating our code from\u00a0`next() -> Option<Result<RecordBatch>>`\r\n\r\non the trait Iterator, so that we can leverage the rich Rust iterator API.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
