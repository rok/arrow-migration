Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimplifying a predicate using is_null with a guarantee using invert(is_null()) doesn't lead to any simplification.\r\n\r\nOnce supported, tests should be added for Datasets to exercise row group filtering (and to generate the necessary clauses from statistics).",
