I helped with parts of the offline installation scripting, and I'd be happy to help here.\r\n\r\n`create_package_with_all_dependencies()` is currently designed to be run on a linux machine to produce a dependency bundle for offline installation on another linux machine. As you all have found, it hits minor snags on a Mac, and major snags when it tries to run the [download_dependencies.sh](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/thirdparty/download_dependencies.sh) shell script on a Windows machine.\r\n\r\nThe underlying files that are downloaded are listed in [versions.txt](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/thirdparty/versions.txt). The files that get downloaded do not depend on the system running the command, and cmake will check the files' hashes to be sure.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOne way to make this function more platform-independent would be to continue using `{}versions.txt{`}, but run the downloads in R instead of using `{}download_dependencies.sh{`}. Does that seem reasonable? This change might be easier said than done, because we need the [`DEPENDENCIES` array](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/f9f2c0827e1e605717d954c6899fe07b08f599cb/cpp/thirdparty/versions.txt#L106-L139) with all the variables substituted in."
