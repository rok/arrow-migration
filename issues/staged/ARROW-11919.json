        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11919](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11919). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCreate arrow.Array, an abstract MATLAB class which represents arrow memory. Users can create an arrow.Array from MATLAB arrays. Concrete subclasses, such as arrow.UInt64Array or arrow.Float64Array, will allow the user to create specific array types. The design mirrors APIs of other language bindings in the Arrow project.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMore details about the MATLAB Interface for Apache Arrow can be found here:\u00a0https://github.com/mathworks/arrow/blob/ARROW-11795/matlab/doc/matlab_interface_for_apache_arrow_design.md",
