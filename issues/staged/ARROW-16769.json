Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently have `Status::Abort()` which gives an easy way to abort the process with a meaningful message and detail.\r\n\r\nWe should similarly add `Status::Warn()` that would simply print a warning message of the error. Possible example use at https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13315/files#diff-1256864b34a1b43082596ab5b16881702881ad06be8e1c157b47e1e6ac9ff5d2R160-R164 (together with `StatusFromErrno`).\r\n",

So making it use the new `Status::Warn` instead seems reasonable to me. The mechanics are different: the current macro also stringifies the condition being checked, but in practice this doesn't really do anything much in the places it's used."
