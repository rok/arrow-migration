Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe main issue limiting scalability in Ballista today is that joins are implemented as hash joins where each partition of the probe side causes the entire left side to be loaded into memory.\r\n\r\nTo make this scalable we need to hash partition left and right inputs so that we can join the left and right partitions in parallel.\r\n\r\nThere is already work underway in DataFusion to implement this that we can leverage.",
