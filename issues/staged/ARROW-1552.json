        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1552](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1552). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, we use Boost on a very limited basis. We should consider making Boost a non-dependency on POSIX-based systems (i.e. we can continue to use boost::filesystem on Windows), and still use Boost where useful in the test suite. ",
