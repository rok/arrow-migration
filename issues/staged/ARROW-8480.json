Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nReported by bluss on Github:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/issues/771>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"What I can see, there is no check for allocation success, so any buffer can be created with a null pointer, which leads to soundness problems in most methods. Best look into using `std::alloc::handle_alloc_error` or alternatives. (This problem means that the mutablebuffer is not a safe abstraction, and it should preferably not be exposed as public API like this.)\"",
