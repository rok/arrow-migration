Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParquetExec currently parallelizes work by passinging individual files to threads. It would be nice to be able to do this in a finer-grained way by assigning row groups and/or column chunks instead. This will be especially important in distributed systems built on DataFusion.",
