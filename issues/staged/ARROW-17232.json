Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeems like the binary upload script now expects some R binaries to upload, but the `packaging` crossbow task group doesn't contain any relevant tasks. \r\n\r\nI assume the `r-binary-packages` should be added to the `packaging` group. \r\n\r\ncc `[~kou]` `[~raulcd]` `[~assignUser]`",
