        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3610](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3610). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe already support constructing an `stl_allocator`\u00a0from a `MemoryPool`, we should also support the reverse conversion. As the STL allocator does not provide a resize, this will always reallocate, even if there is support for it.",
