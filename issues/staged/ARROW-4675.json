        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4675](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4675). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`np.bool` is the only dtype I've found that causes this issue. Both empty and non-empty arrays cause it.\r\n\r\nThe issue only manifests from py2 to py3; staying within the same version succeeds, as does serializing from py3 and deserializing in py2.\r\n\r\nThis appears to just be due to Python 2 `str` being deserialized in Python 3 as `bytes`; it should be `unicode` on the py2 end to come back as `str` in py3. I suppose something in the serialization implementation is writing the dtype (just for bool arrays?) using a `str`, but haven't dug into it yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\n(two)bash-3.2$ python cereal.py\r\n(two)bash-3.2$ cat cereal.py \r\n# Python 2\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\ndata = np.array([], dtype=np.dtype('bool'))\r\nbuf = pa.serialize(data).to_buffer()\r\n\r\noutstream = pa.output_stream(\"buffer\")\r\noutstream.write(buf)\r\noutstream.close()\r\n\r\n# ...switch to python 3 venv...\r\n(three)bash-3.2$ cat decereal.py \r\n# Python 3\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\ninstream = pa.input_stream(\"buffer\")\r\nbuf = instream.read()\r\n\r\ndata = pa.deserialize(buf)\r\nprint(data)\r\n(three)bash-3.2$ python3 decereal.py \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"decereal.py\", line 10, in <module>\r\n    data = pa.deserialize(buf)\r\n  File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 448, in pyarrow.lib.deserialize\r\n  File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 411, in pyarrow.lib.deserialize_from\r\n  File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 262, in pyarrow.lib.SerializedPyObject.deserialize\r\n  File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 175, in pyarrow.lib.SerializationContext._deserialize_callback\r\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"bytes\") to str\r\n```\r\n",
