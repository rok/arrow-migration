Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen reading a JSON Lines file, a segfault can happen if there's a missing field at one point.\r\nIn particular when the missing field is supposed to be a list, and if the block size is small enough.\r\n\r\nHere is an example to reproduce:\r\n```python\n\r\nimport io\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow.json as paj\r\n\r\nbatch = b'{\"a\": [], \"b\": 1}\\n{\"b\": 1}'\r\nblock_size = 12\r\n\r\npaj.read_json(\r\n    io.BytesIO(batch), read_options=paj.ReadOptions(block_size=block_size)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n",

I did verify that your example fails on 5.0.0 but it does not fail on the current 6.0.0 code.  Can you verify this when 6.0.0 releases (we are in the process of releasing 6.0.0 now)"
