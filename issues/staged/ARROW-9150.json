Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeems to be supported through arrow to pandas conversions at the moment. I **believe** the DictionaryUnifier could be leveraged for this.\r\n\r\nNot sure if there are unintended consequences, but the NYI implies that this is desired. Didn't see an open issue for it already.",
