Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nContext Is the following: I am currently dealing with sparse column serialization in parquet. In some cases, many lines are empty I can also have columns containing only empty lists.\r\nHowever I got a segmentation fault when I try to write in parquet thoses columns filled only with empty lists.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple code snipet reproduces the segmentation fault I had:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n\r\nIn [1]: import pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\nIn [2]: import pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\nIn [3]: pa_ar = pa.array([[],[]],pa.list_(pa.int32()))\r\n\r\nIn [4]: table = pa.Table.from_arrays([pa_ar],[\"test\"])\r\n\r\nIn [5]: pq.write_table(\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ...:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 table=table,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ...:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where=\"test.parquet\",\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ...:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 compression=\"snappy\",\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ...:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 flavor=\"spark\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ...: )\r\nSegmentation fault\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMay I have it fixed?\r\n\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nJacques",

After you report the bug; if it is deemed a priority by another developer, they may fix it. Otherwise, if they do not fix it, and you need the fix sooner, we would be glad to accept a pull request. "
