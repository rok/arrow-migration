Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWrapping a sink node's output as a RecordBatchReader is already supported in c++. Currently a table is returned in R's ExecPlan_run to skirt difficult lifetime considerations, but it'd be more correct to allow streaming batches out of an ExecPlan instead of doing all work before ExecPlan_run returns.",
