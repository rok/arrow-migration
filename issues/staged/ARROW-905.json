Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe want to make sure that any committer can update the documentation on http://arrow.apache.org/. Since development environments may vary, it would be useful to have a point-of-truth bash script or Dockerfile for building all of the project API documentation for upload to the website. ",

Along with streamlining packaging for native libraries, we should also make it as simple and portable as possible to update the documentation. A committer will still have to commit and push any changes to arrow-site, though. "
