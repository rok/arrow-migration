        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5135](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5135). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis depends on the following upstream flatbuffers issues:\r\n- https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/5052\n- https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/5053\n- https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/5054\n  \n  Once they are resolved We should generate flatbuffers code automatically, \n  as suggested by [~nevi_me]:\n  \n  ```Java\n  \n  // [arrow/rust/arrow/build.rs]\n  \n  use std::path::Path;\n  use flatc_rust;\n  \n  fn main() {\n      flatc_rust::run(flatc_rust::Args {\n          lang: \"rust\",\n          inputs: &[\n              Path::new(\"../../format/FIle.fbs\"),\n              Path::new(\"../../format/Message.fbs\"),\n              Path::new(\"../../format/Schema.fbs\"),\n              Path::new(\"../../format/Tensor.fbs\"),\n              Path::new(\"../../format/SparseTensor.fbs\"),\n          ],\n          out_dir: Path::new(\"./src/ipc/gen/\"),\n          // doesn't seem to be honoured\n          includes: &[Path::new(\"../../format/\")],\n          ..Default::default()\n      }).expect(\"Unable to build flatbuffer files\");\n  }\n  \n  // [arrow/rust/arrow/Cargo.toml]\n  [package]\n  ...\n  build = \"build.rs\"\n  \n  ...\n  \n  [build-dependencies]\n  flatc-rust = \"0.1\"\n  ```",
