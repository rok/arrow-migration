Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee ARROW-14257\r\n\r\nThe current error message gives \"Asynchronous scanning is not supported by SyncScanner\"\r\n\r\nCopying the comment of `[~westonpace]`:\r\n\r\nIn Python it is always use_async=True. In R the scanner is hidden from the user on dataset writes but the option there is use_async as well. In C++ the option is UseAsync in the ScannerBuilder. How about,\r\n\r\n\"Writing datasets requires that the input scanner is configured to scan asynchronously via the use_async or UseAsync options.\"\r\n",
