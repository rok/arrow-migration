        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18341](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18341). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a note on the python development page under Widnows section about bundling the Arrow C++ libraries with Python extensions:\r\n\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/developers/python.html#building-on-windows>\r\n\r\nThis note can be revised:\r\n \\* if you are using conda, the fact that Arrow C++ libs are not bundled is fine since conda will ensure those libs are found.\r\n \\* If you are not using conda, you have to ensure those libs can be found: either by updating `PATH` (every time before importing pyarrow), or either by bundling them (... using the `PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP` env variable instead of `{}--bundle-arrow-cpp{`}). With the caveat those won't be automatically updated when rebuilding the arrow-cpp libs then.",
