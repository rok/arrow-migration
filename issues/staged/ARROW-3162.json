        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3162](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3162). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile it will be straightforward to offer a Flight client to Python users, enabling _servers_ to be written _in Python_ will require a glue class to invoke methods on a provided server implementation, coercing to and from various Python objects and Arrow wrapper classes",

Opaque data from the server API will be passed to Python as pyarrow.Buffer objects or PyBytes as appropriate"
