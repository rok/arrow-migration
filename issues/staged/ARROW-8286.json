        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8286](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8286). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\nimport pyarrow.dataset as ds\r\n\r\ntable = pa.table({'a': np.random.randn(10), 'b': range(10), 'c': ['a', 'b'] * 5})\r\npq.write_table(table, \"test.parquet\")\r\n\r\nimport pathlib\r\n\r\nds.dataset(pathlib.Path(\"./test.parquet\"))\r\n# gives UnionDataset\r\n\r\nds.dataset(str(pathlib.Path(\"./test.parquet\")))\r\n# correctly gives FileSystemDataset\r\n```\r\n\r\nand since those two dataset classes have different API, this is important to give FileSystemDataset",
