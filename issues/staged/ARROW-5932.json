Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was installing Apache Arrow in my Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa server. I followed the instructions on the official arrow website (using the ubuntu 18.04 method). However, when I was trying to compile the examples, the g++ compiler threw out some errors.\r\n\r\nI have updated my g++ to g+-6, update my libstdc+ library, and using flag -lstdc++, but it still didn't work.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n//\u4ee3\u7801\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\r\ng++-6 -std=c++11 -larrow -lparquet main.cpp -lstdc++\u00a0\r\n```\r\nThe error message:\r\n\r\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libarrow.so: undefined reference to `__cxa_init_primary_exception@CXXABI_1.3.11'\r\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libarrow.so: undefined reference to `std::__exception_ptr::exception_ptr::exception_ptr(void\\*)@CXXABI_1.3.11'\r\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI do not know what to do this moment. Can anyone help me?",

If you can provide more details about your build environment we can try to help you. We have Dockerfiles that use 18.04 to build the project and there seems to be no issue there, so it is likely a problem with your environment"
