        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12207](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12207). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe future contract currently requires that the producer always mark a future finished (not necessarily successfully).\u00a0 Either through bugs or a misunderstanding of the contract it's possible a producer fails to do so.\u00a0 This can lead to a memory leak or potentially a deadlock (if arrow::internal::RunSerially is merged).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nApache Mesos avoids this by splitting the \"Future\" class into a producer facing class (named Promise) and a consumer facing class.\u00a0 If all references to a Promise are lost then the future is marked abandoned (e.g. invalid status).",
