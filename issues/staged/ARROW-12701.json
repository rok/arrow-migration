The PR at\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/289\u00a0generates a changelog for the Arrow Rust releases, but no work was done to include the commits, contributors, etc. for those Rust repos in the main Arrow release notes and blog posts."

What naming conventions do you plan on using for release branches?  The arrow repo uses the format `release-X.Y.Z` - are you using this convention or something else?  I saw a branch called `active_release` but wasn't sure if this was temporary."
