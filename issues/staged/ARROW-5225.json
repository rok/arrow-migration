        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5225). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow in\u00a0_BaseValueVector#getValidityBufferSizeFromCount_\u00a0 and\u00a0_BitVectorHelper#getValidityBufferSize_, it uses\u00a0_Math.ceil_\u00a0to calculate size which is not efficient (lots of unnecessary logic in\u00a0_StrictMath#floorOrCeil_)\u00a0. Since the valueCount is always not less than 0, we could simply replace _Math.ceil_ with the following code:\r\n\r\n_return (valueCount+7) >> 3_;",
