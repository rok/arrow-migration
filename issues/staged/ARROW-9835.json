        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9835](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9835). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, our code works as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Declare a UDF via `udf::ScalarFunction`\r\n 2. Register the UDF\r\n 3. call `scalar_function(\"name\", vec![...], type)` to use it during planning.\r\n\r\nHowever, during planning, we:\r\n\r\n1. Get the ScalarFunction by name\r\n 2. convert it to FunctionMetadata\r\n 3. get the ScalarFunction associated with FunctionMetadata's name\r\n\r\nI.e. `FunctionMetadata` does not seem to be needed.\r\n\r\nGoal: remove `FunctionMetadata` and just pass `udf::ScalarFunction` directly from the registry to the physical plan.",
