Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nYou can set the type ID manually, but you cannot set the offset or validity directly. Ideally, we'd have an API like Python that lets us build it directly from constituent vectors and the offsets/type IDs.",

Semantically, this is intended as the union of distinct top-level schemas so that we can pass through different datasets in a single Flight RPC. Ideally we can do this with minimal/no copying or allocation, so being able to just transfer the arrays from the input VectorSchemaRoots and construct the right type ID and offset buffers is perfect."
