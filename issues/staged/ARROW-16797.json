We should be able to choose the template at runtime https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates?view=azure-devops#parameters-to-select-a-template-at-runtime\r\n\r\nOf course this would mean that we need to remove the task parametrization from tasks.yml and let the upstream feedstock configutation handle the build matrix. \r\n\r\nMixing it with the arrow-r feedstock is less trivial though (perhaps we should just drop that)."
