        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10542](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10542). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdding support for flight in net core would be a required component for me, since a project I am working on is looking to migrate from our proprietary protocol to Arrow.\r\n\r\nThis is something I can start myself to do, but I would like some feedback, firstly:\r\n\r\nAllot of the C# code is internal only, and at the start now I added the grpc libraries in the \"Apache.Arrow\" project, this requires a bump of the supported framework version from 1.3 to 1.5\r\n\r\nIf this is not ok, a lot of the existing code would have to be refactored.\r\n\r\nThe gRPC client framework requires .netstandard 2.1, I plan to add this to a seperate project completely, to not remove support from netstandard1.5 and above from the main lib.\r\n\r\nImplementation wise I am looking mostly on the java code to try and not reinvent the wheel. But an initial version would not come with the buffer optimizations that java and C++ has if that is ok.",
