        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11164](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11164). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9108 adds the ltrim and rtrim functions to datafusion, following postgres. However, postgres offers a second optional argument (the character to trim) that is not yet implemented, as described on https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-string.html\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n ![103891510-f84d8800-50b7-11eb-929e-94f56c2364cd.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13018320/103891510-f84d8800-50b7-11eb-929e-94f56c2364cd.png) \r\n\r\n\r\nThis ticket tracks the work to add support for the second optional arguments (what character to trim) - it would probably be a good introductory item for new contributors.\r\n\r\nThere is more context here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9108#pullrequestreview-563440252",
