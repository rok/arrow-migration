        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11851](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11851). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs we observed in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9565#discussion_r586347165 datafusion won't coerce null literals, forcing strange syntax such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrpad('hi', CAST(NULL AS INT), 'xy')\r\n\r\nWe should add automatic coercion logic from the null literal to any type and this expression should work just fine (produce a NULL output)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrpad('hi', NULL, 'xy')\r\n```",
