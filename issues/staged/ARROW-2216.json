Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe descriptions of each of the CI builds are hard to decipher without looking at the build scripts, which are themselves quite complex.\r\n\r\nFor example in this job: https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/346309532 you can see that the envars `CC` and `CXX` are set to `\"clang-5.0\"` and `\"clang++-5.0\"` respectively and they are then immediately set to `gcc` and `g++`.'\r\n\r\nWithout intimate knowledge of the script it's very hard to diagnose CI issues.",

Do you have an idea how to make them more manageable?"

I would say we should be less reliant on behavior from Travis CI directives like `compiler: gcc` if possible, instead setting things explicitly in our shell scripts"
