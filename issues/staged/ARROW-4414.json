Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCOMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS option of add_custom_command is too new on Ubuntu Xenial and Debian stretch. It's available since CMake 3.8: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.8/command/add_custom_command.html\r\nWe need to stop using it in cpp/src/gandiva/precompiled/CMakeLists.txt\r\n\r\nAlso We should pin cmake to version 3.5 in travis builds (xenial ships cmake 3.5)",
