Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSteps to reproduce:\n \\* Read a parquet file with `pyarrow.parquet.read_table` and convert the table to a DataFrame with `to_pandas`\n \\* Repeat this several times and see an ever increasing memory usage\n\nThis seems to happen only in this combination. Calling `gc.collect` doesn't help.",
