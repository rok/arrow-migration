        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2652](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2652). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe often have users that report segmentation faults in `pyarrow`. This will sadly keep reappearing as we also don't have the magical ability of writing 100%-bug-free code. Thus we should have a small section in our documentation on how people can give us the relevant information in the case of a segmentation fault. Preferably the documentation covers `gdb`\u00a0and `lldb`. They both have similar commands but differ in some minor flags.\r\n\r\nFor one of the example comments I gave to a user in tickets see https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2089#issuecomment-393477116",
