Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis will shield implementations from having to deal with SinkNodeConsumer.  The implementation should be pretty similar to the SinkNode that we have today for exec plans.  We can use a PushGenerator to be our producer/consumer queue that the RecordBatchReader consumes.  The Substrait sink consumer will then push into that PushGenerator.  This method would fail if the plan has more than one top-level relation (e.g. more than one sink).",
