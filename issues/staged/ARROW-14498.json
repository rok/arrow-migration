        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14498](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14498). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe may need to regenerate older docs to include new changes, e.g. the new version dropdown feature. \r\n\r\nSince we need to regenerate the docs for the first time, it would be great if we could encapsulate this in a script. After applying the patch `archery docker run ubuntu-docs` should do the rest, similarly like we use in the post-release task https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/post-09-docs.sh\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/release/generate-docs.sh <version> <patch>\r\n\r\ndev/release/generate-docs.sh 6.0.0  # no patch required\r\ndev/release/generate-docs.sh 5.0.0 docs.patch\r\ndev/release/generate-docs.sh 4.0.0 docs.patch\r\ndev/release/generate-docs.sh 3.0.0 docs.patch\r\n\r\n1. then deploy to asf-site\n   ```\n   \n   cc `[~jorisvandenbossche]`",

And more importantly, those patches probably won't apply cleanly to those older docs since many other things have changed in the meantime (eg the older docs before 4.0 actually use a different sphinx theme, so practically speaking it's only 4.0 and 5.0 that _could_ be regenerated).\r\n\r\n(that doesn't mean we can't keep good track of how we did it now once for 5.0, so _if_ it turns out we will do this regularly later, it's easy to convert that into a script)"
