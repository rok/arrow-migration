Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, for writing a table to disk directly, the defaults are suitable when going to a CSV, IPC, Parquet, etc. However, writing a dataset requires multiple options to be configured, even when defaults could be obvious, e.g., the name for the fragments requires user input, when often they'll be named something like \"part\\{i}.parquet.\" Ideally, the defaults should be adequate to write a Dataset, without further user configuration.",
