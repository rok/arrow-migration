Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nit looks like we currently only have the ability to create arrays from various Rust primitives, and not the ability to convert single values into Arrow Native types.\r\n\r\nI'd like to motivate for the ability to do the latter, as\u00a0Arrow downstream users can use this to create literal values **(e,g, Float32Array /**+- Float32Type::from(2.1f32))\\*",
