        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12921](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12921). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImplement a RadosParquetFileFormat class to defer the evaluation of scan operations on a Parquet dataset to a RADOS storage backend. This can be done by using the librados C++ library to execute storage side functions that scan the files on the Ceph storage nodes (OSDs) using Arrow libraries. This issue is an upgrade to the previous story of ARROW-10549.
