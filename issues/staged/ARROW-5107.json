Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe release verification script has the following signature:\r\n `dev/release/verify-release.sh source|binaries X.Y.Z RC`\r\n\r\nWhich makes it impossible to verify actual (non-rc) releases.\r\n\r\nIt could be useful to test already released artifacts, like:\r\n`dev/release/verify-release.sh source|binaries X.Y.Z`",

So adding support for release (not candidate) is odd.\r\nIt's OK to me that we rename `verify-release-candidate.sh` to `verify-release.sh` and it supports both release and release candidate."
