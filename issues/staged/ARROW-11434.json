Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe rust `length` kernel currently counts number of bytes/octets rather than characters given that Arrow uses UTF8 encoding.\r\n\r\nThis means that the result of the `length` kernel on a string like `jos\u00e9` will be 5 bytes rather than 4 characters.",
