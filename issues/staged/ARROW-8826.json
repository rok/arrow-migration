Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-7803, I edited the crossbow templates for the homebrew jobs to substitute in the correct fork of arrow and append the current git SHA so that the code under test corresponds to the requested git commit. Unfortunately, this caused the nightly builds to fail. \r\n\r\nComparing a successful on-demand run (https://github.com/ursa-labs/crossbow/blob/actions-266-travis-homebrew-r-autobrew/.travis.yml) with a nightly run (https://github.com/ursa-labs/crossbow/blob/nightly-2020-05-16-0-travis-homebrew-cpp/.travis.yml), it appears that the default \"remote\" URL that crossbow uses when not on a fork/PR does not contain the \".git\" suffix. And I suspect that Homebrew requires that in order to identify the source as a git repo in order to clone it correctly.",
