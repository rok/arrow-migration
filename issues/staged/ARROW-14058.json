        "title": "[Python] Update use of FunctionOptions scoped enums once Cython 3 is the default",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14058](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14058). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn [_pyarrow/_compute.pyx_](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/_compute.pyx) there are several scoped enums for FunctionOptions (e.g., RoundMode and SortOrder) which are not used in dictionaries but rather with a chain of if-elses because scoped enums are not fully supported in Cython >= 0.29.x since they do not resolve to an underlying integral type. We would like to be consistent with the use of other FunctionOptions and use a dictionary when mapping string input to enum constant.\r\n\r\nIn order for the above to work in Cython 3, we also need to update the definition of the scoped enums found in [_pyarrow/includes/libarrow.pxd_](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/includes/libarrow.pxd) to the form of\r\n```c++\n\r\ncpdef enum class CRoundMode(int8_t)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Reference to Cython 3 soped enum\\|    # https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/wrapping_CPlusPlus.html#scoped-enumerations]",
