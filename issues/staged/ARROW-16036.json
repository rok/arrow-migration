        "title": "[C++] Substrait SinkNode Modification for usability",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16036](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16036). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the Substrait implementation uses a `consuming_sink` node as the end-point to capture the results of an executed query. To further enhance the ability to use the wide variety of `SinkNode`s in the streaming execution engine, it is better to evaluate other options to provide usability for various use cases.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSome of the use cases include consuming a Substrait query plan in R and Python APIs. And this extends beyond the Arrow APIs where third-party tools willing to use Substrait can be benefitted from these. At the moment there is active work on providing R/Python APIs for Substrait consumption (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15779).\u00a0\r\nA potential modification to provide usability is to take in a `SinkNodeFactory`-like interface instead of just using the `ConsumingSink` (current implementation). Such a modification would provide flexibility in developing a wide array of applications.\u00a0\r\nThis issue is open for discussion.\u00a0",
