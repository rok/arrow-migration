Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be convenient to be able to sort a `StructArray` on one of its columns. This can be done by combining multiple compute functions, but having a helper that does that for you would probably be better.",
