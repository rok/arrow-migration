Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAllow the user to supply the `col_names` argument from `readr` when reading in a dataset.  \r\n\r\nThis is already possible when reading in a single CSV file via `arrow::read_csv_arrow()` via the `readr_to_csv_read_options` function, and so once the C++ functionality to autogenerate column names for Datasets is implemented, we should hook up `readr_to_csv_read_options` in `csv_file_format_read_opts` just like we have with `readr_to_csv_parse_options` in `csv_file_format_parse_options`.",
