Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDespite the fact that the Flight.proto says the following:\r\n\r\n> \"schema of the dataset as described in Schema.fbs::Schema.\"\r\n\r\nIt implementations seem to use a fully serialized RecordBatch just with 0 rows for the schema byte fields in GetFlightInfo and GetSchema. So the Go implementation should follow suit.",
