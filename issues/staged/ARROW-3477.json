Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile investigating PARQUET-1438 we have discovered that there is a regression in arrow-cpp testsuite results between versions 0.10.0 and 0.11.0 when running in 32 bit executable. There used to be just a single test failing:\r\n\r\n- array-test\n  \n  and starting 0.11.0 it's four tests:\n  \n- array-test\n- buffer-test\n- bit-util-test\n- rle-encoding-test\n  \n  (list not including parquet-\\* tests)\n  \n  I did bisect and found that the three tests were broken in 479c011a6ac7a8f1e6d77ecf651a4b2be9e5eec0",

Arrow is definitely not supported on 32-bit targets. Even if it might work, its performance will probably be suboptimal due to the widespread use of 64-bit integers in the codebase."

Last time I tried compiling on a 32-bit raspberry pi was over a year ago"
