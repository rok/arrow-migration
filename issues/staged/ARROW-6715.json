Plasma embeds CUDA depended code in it's core code. If we want to make nvidia-cuda-toolkit optional for Plasma packages, we need to build Plasma with/without `-DARROW_CUDA=ON` and build two Plasma packages for with/without CUDA like `libplasma-dev` and `libplasma-cuda-dev`. Users must choose one of `libplasma-dev` and `libpalsma-cuda-dev`. They can't install both of them at the same time.\r\n\r\nI don't want to do this approach because it increases packaging build time...\r\n\r\nIt's better that Plasma uses the approach that Apache Arrow C++ core uses."

It wasn't obvious for me from the initial description whether we suddenly had a hard dependency on CUDA in Plasma. This is the setup/reasoning I was aware, so everything fine from my side \ud83d\udc4d"
