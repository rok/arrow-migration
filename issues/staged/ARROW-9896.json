        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9896). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are five tools in go/arrow/ipc/cmd directory. The other four tools are named the same with that described in the code. But the\u00a0'arrow-json-intergration-test' is different. The code name it \"arrow-json\". So maybe it would be better that this directory renamed to 'arrow-json'",
