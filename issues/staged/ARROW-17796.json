Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was wondering if we can use cbind stating particular column names when merging multi datasets using open_dataset(), so that we can bind only those particular cols.\r\n\r\nI was using open_dataset to read multi datasets in a particular directory and wanted to merge  these multi datasets based on some particular columns that are common to all the datasets.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to merge these datasets column wise, since by default open_dataset is merging all the datasets one after the other row-wise?\r\n\r\nDo let me know if there's anything like this or any other work around.",
