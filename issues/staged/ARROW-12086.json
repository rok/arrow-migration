Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am following the instructions in order to build the parquet libraries, and there are some firewall restrictions in our dvpmt environment.\r\n\r\nI have followed the instructions mentioned in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/cpp/building.rst>\r\n\r\nregarding\u00a0Offline Builds:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n./thirdparty/download_dependencies.sh $HOME/arrow-thirdparty >env.sh\r\n. ./env.sh\r\ncd\u00a0cpp\r\nmkdir debug\r\ncd debug\r\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DARROW_PARQUET=ON -DARROW_DATASET=ON ..\r\nmake parquet arrow_dataset\n```\r\nThe result is that the process simply ignores the environment variables and tries to download the packages from the cloud - facing the firewall restrictions, and then it fails after a number of attempts at trying to download the packages.\r\n### \u00a0",

I don't know where the point is where it\ntests this condition.\n\nNow, what happens if the machine is not offline (so the url\nhttps://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/archive/v2.5.0.tar.gz is visible)\nbut the firewall does not allow the application to download it, so it goes\nthrough the loop, failing every time?\n\nMy proposal is that, if the environment variable ARROW_UTF8PROC_URL is set,\njust copy the file it points to, into the corresponding place instead of\neven checking if the url is visible and trying to download it from\nhttps://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/archive/v2.5.0.tar.gz.\n\nI hope I made myself clear enough now.\nThank you.\n\nOn Thu, Mar 25, 2021 at 4:05 PM Antoine Pitrou (Jira) <jira@apache.org>\n\n"
