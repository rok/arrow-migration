        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15612). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA number of Flight APIs use the convention of returning a `Status` and filling an actual return value in a pointer-out (`T*`) parameter. They should be migrated to returning `Result<T>` instead, together with a deprecation notice on the legacy API.\r\n\r\nExamples are `BasicAuth::Serialize`, `BasicAuth::Deserialize`, `Location::Parse`, etc.",
