        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9885](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9885). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe function `numerical_coercion` only uses the operator `op` for its error formatting. But the function's intent can be simply generalized to \"coerce two types to numerically equivalent types\".",
