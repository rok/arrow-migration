Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe memory leaks that were fixed by a workaround before the last release (ARROW-17252) are present again. I had hoped that the improvements to the captured R thread infrastructure in ARROW-11841 and ARROW-17178 would fix this; however, they don't (and it's not even clear that the failures are related to that, since as part of diagnosing those failures the last time I disabled the safe call infrastructure completely and was still able to observe failures).\r\n\r\nThese failures need to be debugged before the release!",
