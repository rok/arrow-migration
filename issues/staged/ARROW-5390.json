Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe now frequently hit the 50 minutes job time limit on Travis-CI on the \"Python 2.7 and 3.6 unit tests w/ Valgrind, conda-forge toolchain, coverage\" job.\r\n\r\ne.g. https://travis-ci.org/pitrou/arrow/jobs/535373888\r\n\r\nHopefully we can soon ditch Python 2.7, which would allow saving a bit of time.",

We're getting closer to the Python 2.7 drop dead date so the number of times we may need to fix 2.7-specific issues is growing limited"
