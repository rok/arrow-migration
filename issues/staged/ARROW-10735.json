Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDepends on ARROW-10734. If we can successfully build Arrow with the C++ library on all of CRAN's platforms, we can remove the conditional build wrapping and codegen. This will simplify the R package's C++ code, remove some bloat, and make for a simpler user experience.\r\n\r\nWe do still though need the conditional build of S3 support.",

Since we're already on the CRAN Solaris blocklist for being flaky/incomplete build anyway, I think the arrow-without-arrow doesn't help us anymore--it's not saving us from CRAN hassle. We build successfully on every other CRAN platform. cc `[~romainfrancois]` `[~bkietz]`"
