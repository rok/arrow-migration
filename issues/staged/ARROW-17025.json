Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a PR gets merged and its description `@` references a user, then the user will get a GitHub notification every time that commit gets pushed to a fork. This can be rather a bother, so it might be nice if the merge script could warn about this, or possibly even rewrite the commit message.",
