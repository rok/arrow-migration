Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome classes' methods use BaseAllocator or cast BufferAllocator to BaseAllocator internally instead of requiring for BufferAllocator directly, e.g. codes in AllocationManager, BufferLedger.\r\n\r\nThis can be optimized by exposing necessary methods from BufferAllocator. \r\n",
