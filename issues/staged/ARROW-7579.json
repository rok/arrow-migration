        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7579](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7579). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should make it possible to _not_ invoke Handshake for services that don't want it. Especially when using it with flight-grpc, where the standard gRPC authentication mechanisms don't know about Flight and try to authenticate the Handshake endpoint - it's easy to forget to configure this endpoint to bypass authentication.",
