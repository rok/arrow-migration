Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur macOS CI builds on Github Actions usually take at least 10 minutes installing dependencies from Homebrew (because of compiling from source?). It would be nice to cache those, especially as they probably don't change often.",

Just over all a lot but still nothing  Isee the cache really speeding up. \r\n\r\nThe timeout is set to 60 minutes so we could just raise that limit if it is not  applicable for the current build complexity (or as you said remove features).
