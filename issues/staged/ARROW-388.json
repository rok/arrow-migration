Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn an IPC setting, you may wish to interpret a file-like object by some other frame of reference. For example, you may want to consider the middle of a file to be the initial 0 position \u2013 this would all be done with zero copy and no \"work\" performed, strictly passing through method calls to the underlying file interface.
