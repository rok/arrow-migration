Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi, I have been trying to connect to HDFS cluster using pyarrow version 3.0.0, connection goes through, but I am unable to perform any operation involving HDFS cluster. Here is the error thrown:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nFile \"pyarrow_test.py\", line 8, in <module>\r\nhdfs.create_dir('test3')\r\nFile \"pyarrow/_fs.pyx\", line 450, in pyarrow._fs.FileSystem.create_dir\r\nFile \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 99, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\nOSError: HDFS create directory failed, errno: 13 (Permission denied)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS: I have checked access permissions and they are correct. I am able to access the files and create directories with the 'hdfs' command. \r\nHadoop cluster is Kerberos enabled, I have used the following line to create connection:\r\n`hdfs = fs.HadoopFileSystem('<hostname>', 8020, user='<username>', kerb_ticket='/tmp/krb5cc_500')`",

Kerberos ticket and username are correct, everything works from command line. Trying to dig deeper, but still no luck. Other operations won't work, either. Any advice on how to debug this?"

We had a bit different versions inside the container with pyarrow and outside, which led to some small differences in CLASSPATH variable. I wonder if it's possible to somehow get a meaningful exception here instead of \"Permission denied\" though."
