        "title": "[Python] Allow usage of field_names in partitioning when saving datasets",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13755](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13755). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen loading back datasets, it's possible to quickly provide the name of the columns for which data was partitioned using\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\npartitioning=pyarrow.dataset.partitioning(field_names=[\"year\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is convenient because it's easier and quicker than providing the whole schema, which can still be autodetected from the loaded data.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, we don't support this when _saving_ data. If you provide `field_names` instead of the `schema` you will get a crash\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\npyarrow/dataset.py in _ensure_write_partitioning(scheme)\r\n    684     if not isinstance(scheme, Partitioning):\r\n    685         # TODO support passing field names, and get types from schema\r\n--> 686         raise ValueError(\"partitioning needs to be actual Partitioning object\")\r\n    687     return scheme\r\n    688 \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient to allow to use `field_names` only even when saving as we can automatically detect the schema from the table itself that we are saving.",
