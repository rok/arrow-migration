Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen casting eg `timestamp('s')` to `timestamp('ns')`, we do not check for out of bounds timestamps, giving \"garbage\" timestamps in the result:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [74]: a_np = np.array([\"2012-01-01\", \"2412-01-01\"], dtype=\"datetime64[s]\")                                                                                                                                      \r\n\r\nIn [75]: arr = pa.array(a_np)                                                                                                                                                                                      \r\n\r\nIn [76]: arr                                                                                                                                                                                                       \r\nOut[76]: \r\n<pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at 0x7f3d1f07cb88>\r\n[\r\n  2012-01-01 00:00:00,\r\n  2412-01-01 00:00:00\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn [77]: arr.cast(pa.timestamp('ns'))                                                                                                                                                                              \r\nOut[77]: \r\n<pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at 0x7f3d1f07cfa8>\r\n[\r\n  2012-01-01 00:00:00.000000000,\r\n  1827-06-13 00:25:26.290448384\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is the same behaviour as numpy, so not sure we should do this. However, since we have a `safe=True/False`, I would expect that for `safe=True` we check this and for `safe=False` we do not check this.  \r\n(numpy has a similiar `casting='safe'` but also does not raise an error in that case).\r\n",
