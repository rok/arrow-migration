Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter reading the installation vignette I'm reporting this installation issue.\r\n\r\nI couldn't install the R package by building the C++ libraries as I hit:\r\n```r\n\r\n# arch arrow install unable to load shared object R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/00LOCK-arrow/00new/arrow/libs/arrow.so\u00a0: undefined symbol: _ZTIN6apache6thrift8protocol9TProtocolE\n```\r\nI tried to set R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH as suggested but it didn't help. Maybe I made a mistake.\r\n\r\nUsing a prebuild arrow binary was failing as the version on the Arch AUR was 0.17.0 while the CRAN was wanting 0.17.1, and the even the AUR 0.17.0 install was failing because there are apparently issues with grpc 1.28+ (I was on 1.29.1) according to <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/arrow/>\r\n\r\nI finally solved the issue by setting -DARROW_FLIGHT to OFF during installation from the AUR ( I also turned -DARROW_WITH_SNAPPY to ON):\r\n```bash\n\r\nyay --editmenu -S arrow\r\n```\r\nThen to install the R package I had to set NOT_CRAN=true & install the 0.17.0 version:\r\n```r\n\r\nSys.setenv(\"NOT_CRAN\"=\"true\")\r\npackageurl <- \"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/arrow/arrow_0.17.0.tar.gz\"\r\ninstall.packages(packageurl, repos=NULL, type=\"source\")\r\n```\r\nThis led to a working R install, but I never solved my issue compiling the C++ binaries during R install. Perhaps this relates to the same issue with grpc?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I didn't save all the error messages I hit, but I've included a working PKGBUILD for my system, edited from <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/arrow/>. I hope it helps.",

A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n- Because arrow is developing quickly, you need to have exact match between the C++ library version and the R package version. Sometimes patch releases will just work but that wasn't the case with 0.17.1.\n- Odd that https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/arrow/ didn't get updated for 0.17.1, must have been an oversight in the patch release process.\n- The bundled C++ build with the R package doesn't involve grpc because the R package doesn't have bindings for Flight, so that wasn't the issue.\n- It appears that the bundled build couldn't find Thrift. I wonder if it would work if you set the environment variable `EXTRA_CMAKE_FLAGS=\"-DThrift_SOURCE=BUNDLED\"` to force the bundled C++ build to build Thrift (rather than rely on system Thrift)."
