Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis would prevent segfaults by putting the externalptr in the wrong kind of R6 container, plus allow us to skip a bunch of hackery where we try to track or guess the class of the object returned from call_function (could be Array, ChunkedArray, Scalar, RecordBatch, or Table).\r\n\r\nreticulate does something along these lines; it's a subclass of environment I think but not exactly an R6 class.",
