Normally the server takes care of parallelism internally. If we have to launch several server instances to get good parallel performance, that would mean a problem in grpc. `[~davidli]`"

The gRPC maintainers say there are cases where multiple servers may be necessary (especially if using TLS), but those are relatively rare...they've never expanded on when.\r\n\r\nSide note, I was wondering why I'm not getting pinged...turns out there is another David Li in JIRA. I am \"@lidavidm\", confusingly."
