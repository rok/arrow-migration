Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor more advanced aggregations, it's helpful to be able to gather the grouped values into a list array. Pandas and Polars both have that feature. And `hash_distinct` already aggregates to lists, so all the building blocks are there.",
