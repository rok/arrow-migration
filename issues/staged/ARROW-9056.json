Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7308. Many/most would no-op (sum, mean, min, max), but maybe they should exist and not error? Maybe they're not needed, but I could see how you might invoke a function on the result of a previous aggregation or something.",
