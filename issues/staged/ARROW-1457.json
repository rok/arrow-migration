Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, if we call WriteTensor on a strided Tensor, it will write the tensor element by element; this can be optimized by combining multiple consecutive writes together.\n\nIf there are long stretches of contiguous data, this might even be able to take advantage of the multithreaded memory copy we have int the FixedSizeBufferWriter.",
