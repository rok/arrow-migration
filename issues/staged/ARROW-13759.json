Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the script in `cpp/build-support/run_clang_format.py` requires modifying to run on any machines/environments where the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python` finds the system python2 instead of python3.   \r\n\r\nUpdating the shebang line to read `python3` instead of `python` would fix this.",
