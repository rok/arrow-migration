The wheels for Windows have been removed due to installation problems (see ARROW-6015), and right now there will need to step up new volunteers to fix the windows wheel building. See the mailing list thread at https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/128a2bec285ad45aa4189ebb39a15b39dcf6d91c4ab0278ff4f7cdea@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E for more discussion.\r\n\r\nYou can install the precompiled python package on Windows using `conda` (from the conda-forge channel)."

Hopefully there will be 0.15.0 Windows wheels available if someone is willing to debug the issue we had with 0.14.1"
