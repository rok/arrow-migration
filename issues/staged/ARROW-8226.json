Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI ran into some overflow issues with the existing 32 bit binary builder. My changes add a new binary builder that uses 64-bit offsets + tests.\r\n\r\nI also added a panic for when the 32-bit offset binary builder overflows.\r\n\r\nFinally I made both binary builders resettable.",
