        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7828](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7828). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`dev/release/binary/id_rsa*` SSH keys are only used to login to local Docker container for\r\nreleasing binary artifacts. They aren't used over network. So putting\r\nthem to this public repository is safe.\r\n\r\nBut there are people who report \"they may be danger\" to us. We should\r\nremove them from this repository and generate them locally instead of\r\ndescribing why they aren't danger to reporters.",
