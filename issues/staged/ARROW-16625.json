        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16625](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16625). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis came up in a Flight/Flight SQL demo a colleague was working on; it was possible to write a batch with a differing schema than what was stated for the stream, which would lead to a decoding failure on the other side. It might be useful in DEBUG mode to DCHECK this and fail-fast.\r\n\r\nThe error message could also be improved; `ArrayLoader.GetBuffer` could at least return the index and the actual # of buffers",
