Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`clang-format` supports command line option `-output-replacements-xml` which (in the case of no required changes) outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version='1.0'?>\r\n<replacements xml:space='preserve' incomplete_format='false'>\r\n</replacements>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this option during `check-format` instead of using python to compute a diff between formatted and on-disk should speed up that target significantly",
