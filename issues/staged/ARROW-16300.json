I can't reproduce here, it probably depends on the underlying malloc implementation."

Running on the most recent nightly removes the malloc error and properly throws\u00a0 `pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Invalid sort key column: No match for FieldRef.Name(bar) in foo: int64`. Will mark as resolved; sorry for the bother, thanks for your work here."
