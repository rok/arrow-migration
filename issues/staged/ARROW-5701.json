Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently build the JIT for all known selection vector types (there are 4 supported types). For very long expressions, this increases the build time by 4x.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nInstead, we should build only for the required selection vector type.",
