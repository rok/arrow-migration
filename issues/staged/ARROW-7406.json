Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis was introduced by ARROW-6866 making parameter hasher useless in hashCode(int index, `ArrowBufHasher`\u00a0hasher), and the child vectors would calculate hashCode using default hasher which is not correct.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis issue should be fixed by passing hasher to child vector when calculating hashCode.",
