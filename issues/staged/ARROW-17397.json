Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm building an API using python and flask. I want to return a dataframe from the API, i'm serializing the dataframe like so and sending it in the response:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nbatch = pa.record_batch(df)\r\nsink = pa.BufferOutputStream()\r\nwith pa.ipc.new_stream(sink, batch.schema) as writer:\r\nwriter.write_batch(batch)\r\npybytes = sink.getvalue().to_pybytes()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to read it with R ? If so can you provide a code snippet.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRoy",
