        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5505). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe package startup message about masking base functions can be scary. We should avoid masking base functions without a compelling reason (i.e. let's do arrow_array() instead of array(), arrow_table()). The arrow versions do very different things than the base functions; plus, end users shouldn\u2019t be dealing directly with Tables and Arrays, so they don\u2019t need to figure so prominently in the public API of the package.",
