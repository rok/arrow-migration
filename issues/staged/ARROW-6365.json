        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6365](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6365). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nR is flexible when it comes to integer vs. floating point, generally obscuring the details inside a \"numeric\" class, but it knows how to make it seem like my integer-looking data stored in a double is actually integer. This means that an R user can think they have integers even when the underlying storage is not. \r\n\r\nSo I would have expected this to work, and indeed to be one reason I'd want to specify a schema when creating a table:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n> table(a = 1, schema = schema(a = int32()))\r\nError in Table__from_dots(dots, schema) : \r\n  Invalid: Cannot convert R vector of type REALSXP to integer Arrow array\r\n```",
