Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen rendering arrowExports.cpp, if the latest glue release is installed (version 1.5.1), we get a huge diff. I imagine that we should update the generation script to render the previous version or somebody should commit the version with updated glue to avoid the file getting updated by too many PRs?",
