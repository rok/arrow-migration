Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9109\u00a0introduced S3 support in manylinux wheels. However, when trying to use S3FileSystem it fails with\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n File \"pyarrow/_fs.pyx\", line 597, in pyarrow._fs.FileSystem.open_input_stream\r\n File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 122, in pyarrow.lib.pyarrow_internal_check_status\r\n File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 99, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\nOSError: When reading information for key 'xxxxx' in bucket 'xxxxx': AWS Error [code 99]: curlCode: 77, Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?) with address\n```\r\nIt seems like it can't find the SSL CA cert directory that is installed in the runtime machine (tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and\u00a0Ubuntu 18.04). It always searches in\u00a0/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt probably because the wheels are built on centos, whereas in Ubuntu the path is\u00a0/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt and is different on other distributions.\r\n\r\nReproduce with:\r\n```java\n\r\nvirtualenv -p python3.8 arrowenv\r\nsource arrowenv/bin/activate\r\npip install --extra-index-url https://repo.fury.io/arrow-nightlies/ --pre pyarrow\r\npython -c \"from pyarrow.fs import S3FileSystem; fs = S3FileSystem(); fs.open_input_stream('mybucket/myfile')\"\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
