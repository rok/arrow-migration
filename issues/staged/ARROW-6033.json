Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome Arrow functions will fail if e.g. the CPU doesn't have the right instruction set extensions (e.g. POPCNT on x86 - see ARROW-5381). We may want to provide a global function that checks requirements and/or otherwise initializes Arrow internal structures (the single one I can think of is `InitializeUTF8()` in `util/utf8.h`).",
