        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13931](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13931). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nList and struct types aren't sortable and one could debate whether they should be equatable or not but coalesce should only require nullable and all data types should be nullable.  So I would expect coalesce to work on any data type.  At the moment it does not support list/struct data types even when all arguments are the same type.",
