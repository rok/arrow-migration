Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt detects the type from the first chunk and uses it for all chunks. Normally this works ok, but it can lead to unexpected behavior, such as:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\ndata <- list(1:10, NaN)\r\nx <- chunked_array(!!!data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nreturns:\r\n`Error: Invalid: Value is too large to fit in C integer type`\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that might fix/change this: \r\n- improved error message\n- chunked arrays not assuming the first chunk's types can be cast safely to all others\n  \n  Note that in this case, specifying the type to int64() does \"work\" with an overflowed NaN value (-9223372036854775808)\n  \n  ```r\n  \n  data <- list(1:10, NaN)\n  x <- chunked_array(!!!data, type = int64())\n  ```\n  \n",
