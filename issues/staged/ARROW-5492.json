Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nread_feather, read_parquet, read_csv_arrow (and read_json, when it exists) should take a `col_select` argument, following the model of [vroom](http://vroom.r-lib.org/articles/vroom.html#column-selection)\u00a0(readr and base R file readers also support this feature, just much more awkwardly).\r\n\r\nCurrently, read_feather has a \"columns\" argument and none of the other readers expose it. Parquet can certainly support it; cf.\u00a0`pyarrow.parquet.read_table.`\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
