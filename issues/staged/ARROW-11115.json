Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAn efficient implementation of the [dot-product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)\u00a0is useful for many machine-learning applications.\r\n\r\nI would propose to treat null as zero for the implementation. This behavior is sensible because it corresponds to dropping any observation where null-data is present.\u00a0",
