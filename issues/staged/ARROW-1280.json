        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1280](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1280). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, we only support lists with a variable size per entry. In some cases, each entry of a list column will have the same number of elements. In this case, we can use a more effective data structure as well as do certain optimisations on the operations of this type. To implement this type:\r\n\r\n- Describe the memory structure of it in Layout.md\n- Add the type to the enums in the C++ code\n- Add FixedSizeListArray, FixedSizeListType and FixedSizeListBuilder classes to the C++ library",

I would like to see support for FixedSizeList in Python/C++ and I wouldn't think it'd be _too_ hard to adapt the List type"
