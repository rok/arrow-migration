        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16008](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16008). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI had expected:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nResult<T> my_result;\r\nT my_value;\r\n```\r\n\r\nto be more or less equivalent statements (as I think of Result<T> as a \"T or Status variant\").  However, a default result initializes itself with an error status and the error message must be allocated and copied.  As a result, it is considerably more expensive (100's of ns compared to 1's of ns).\r\n\r\nI'm not certain how much of an issue this is however.  It's possible we don't often create default results or their creation is optimized out.  I prototyped a solution but did not see much change in any benchmarks.  So perhaps it is not something worth changing but I figured I'd open it up to discussion.",
