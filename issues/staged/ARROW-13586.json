        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13586](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13586). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe use a `flags` param to pass [runtime configuration to docker containers](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/2d1bd96c951a9c6989c4c475781f59db7987d359/dev/tasks/r/azure.linux.yml#L53)\r\n\r\n- \"flags\" is misnamed (since it is typically providing env vars for the docker run phase, e.g. https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/2d1bd96c951a9c6989c4c475781f59db7987d359/dev/tasks/tasks.yml#L1171)\n- Other additional env vars could probably be consolidated into that more transparently (rather than an alternation of CAPITALIZED and lower_case spellings)\n- Is there a jinja-way to iterate over a list of params and do things like prepend `-e `? So that we don't have to form the string \"-e FOO=true -e BAR=11\" \n- Consider using `archery docker run` instead of docker-compose build ... docker-compose run (cf https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/docker-tests/azure.linux.yml)",
