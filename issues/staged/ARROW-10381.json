        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10381](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10381). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the code to sort is centered around creating an array that can be sorted. This is useful for intra-array comparison, but does not allow things like `merge-sort`, where a comparison between two arrays (of the same data type) is needed.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to generalize the current code to support both.",
