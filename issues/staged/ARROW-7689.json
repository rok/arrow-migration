(See https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/21662). It seems instead of a 1.26.1, they're now working on 1.27. Homebrew tracks upstream, so they also ship a (broken) 1.26. (Unfortunately I haven't had time to work through their bug report checklist - I'm also currently on an unsupported MacOS...)\r\n\r\nI'll try bumping us to 1.25.x from 1.24.3."
