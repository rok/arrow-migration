        "title": "[Python] Bump minimum support pandas version to pandas 1.0",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13351](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13351). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we don't really explicitly define a \"minimum supported version\" for pandas, but we have (nightly) test builds with pandas 0.23 and 0.24 (in addition to latest and master) as oldest tested versions.\r\n\r\nI think we can bump the minimum support version (pandas 0.23 was first released May 15, 2018, so more than three years ago). We could maybe directly bump to pandas 1.0 (released January 29, 2020), or otherwise something in between (eg 0.25, released July 18, 2019).\r\n",
