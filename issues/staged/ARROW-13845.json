Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems the two variants of `RandomArrayGenerator::ArrayOf` (one taking a Field, the other taking a Datatype) use completely different implementations, for no obvious reason. They should be reconciled so that the most powerful implementation is used.",
