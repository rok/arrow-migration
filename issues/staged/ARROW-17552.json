        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17552](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17552). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a follow up to [ARROW-15693](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13975), support for the name \"master\" in the `default_branch` property of the `Target` class defined in `dev/archery/archery/crossbow/core.py` should be removed after the migration to \"main\" as the default Git branch is complete.\r\n\r\nMaking this change will also require updating the implementation of the `Target.is_default_branch()` method to use the keyword `is` instead of `in` for checking whether on the default branch.",
