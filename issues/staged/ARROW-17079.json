        "title": "[C++] Improve error message propagation from AWS SDK",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17079](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17079). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDear all,\r\n\r\nI'd like to see if there is interest to improve the error messages that originate from the AWS SDK. Especially for loading datasets from S3, there are many things that can go wrong and the error messages that (Py)Arrow gives are not always the most actionable, especially if the call involves many different SDK functions. In particular, it would be great to have the following attached to each error message:\r\n \\* A machine parseable status code from the AWS SDK\r\n \\* Information as to exactly which AWS SDK call failed, so it can be disambiguated for Arrow API calls that use multiple AWS SDK calls\r\n\r\nIn the ideal case, as a developer I could reconstruct the AWS SDK call that failed from the error message (e.g. in a form the allows me to run the API call via the \"aws\" CLI program) so I can debug errors and see how they relate to my AWS infrastructure. Any progress in this direction would be super helpful.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor context: I recently was debugging some permissioning issues in S3 based on the current error codes and it was pretty hard to figure out what was going on (see <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/19799#issuecomment-1185035602).>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm happy to take a stab at this problem but might need some help. Is implementing a custom StatusDetail class for AWS errors and propagating errors that way the right hunch here? <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/50f6fcad6cc09c06e78dcd09ad07218b86e689de/cpp/src/arrow/status.h#L110>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nPhilipp.",

Do you need to extract that information programmatically, as a user of the filesystem API, or do you just need a better error printout? If the latter, then improving the message for our AWS errors might be sufficient."

A format that allows programmatic extraction would be nice at some point in the future since it would allow better error messages for higher level libraries, but for now we could just print the raw error message from Arrow :)"
