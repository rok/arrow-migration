Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe R package development instructions in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/README.Rmd expect that the developer is working in a particular R-console-centric way, perhaps within RStudio or similar. I think we should have scripts that enable development to be performed entirely on the command line. This would probably already exist, except that our Travis-CI setup is relying on some non-Arrow-specific scripts that live outside of this repository. ",

The only installation line that assumes you're running from R (the `install_github()` line) is easily wrapped to run from the shell like `R -e 'devtools::install_github(\"apache/arrow/R\")'`, though developers wouldn't use that because you'd have a local checkout to install from.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/README.Rmd#L85-L90>\u00a0gives you full build and test at the command line already using the build tools built into R.\r\n\r\nI agree that the language in\u00a0the readme\u00a0could be made more clear for non-R developers, and could more clearly distinguish instructions for end users vs. for arrow developers, but there aren't\u00a0missing scripts that do magic to make a build."
