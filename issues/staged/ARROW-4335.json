Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the documentation (including docstrings) for the sparse tensor classes and methods is very... sparse. It would be nice to make those approachable.\r\n\r\n(also, a suggestion: rename\u00a0`SparseCSRIndex::indptr()` to something else? perhaps `SparseCSRIndex::row_indices()`?)",
