Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment Substrait only supports parquet.  This will be insufficient for Arrow.  I've opened https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/issues/138 to start the discussion into additional formats.\r\n\r\nOnce some kind of mechanism is adopted we should add support in the C++ Substrait consumer for the new mechanism.",
