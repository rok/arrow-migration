Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNot all linuxen have `bash` at `/bin/bash`. Systems that support `#!/bin/bash` support `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. The `env` variant will take the first available bash interpreter as opposed to a hardcoded location.\r\n\r\nHopefully this is relatively uncontroversial.",
