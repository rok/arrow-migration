Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt shouldn't be too hard to create a verification script which checks the linux packages. This could prevent issues like [ARROW-4368] / <https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/3476>\r\n\r\nI suggest to separate the current verification script into one which verifies the source release artifact and another which verifies the binaries:\r\n \\* checksum and signatures as is right now\r\n \\* install linux packages on multiple distros via docker\r\n\r\nWe could test wheels and conda packages as well, but in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\ncc `[~kou]`",
