        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16739](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16739). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn addition to the full protobuf C++ library, there is also a \"lite\" variant of the library that provides a subset of the full functionality (for example, the message class is `MessageLite` instead of `Message`).\r\n\r\ngRPC seems to have support for using that lite protobuf library: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/15604#issuecomment-409690403\r\n\r\nHopefully it could decrease generated code size and also compile times for bundled gRPC builds. It would also make some pieces of functionality, such as reflection, unavailable.\r\n\r\n",
