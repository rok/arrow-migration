        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17199](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17199). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are a number of small bugs in the Java Flight SQL example (e.g. binding parameters to the wrong index, not handling null parameter values, not properly reporting errors, things throwing SQLException that should use Arrow/general Java exceptions) that should be fixed. \r\n\r\nAlso, CommandPreparedStatementQuery is implemented wrong in both C++ and Java servers: only the last parameter value will be bound/executed when executing a prepared statement that returns a result set. But this contradicts the spec, which states \"All of the bound parameter sets will be executed as a single atomic execution\". The server(s) need to cache the uploaded Arrow data and execute using all input rows.",

Right now, in DoPut, the Java/C++ servers bind each row successively, but don't actually execute anything. So when you go to actually execute the query later, you get only one result row (corresponding to the last parameter row)."
