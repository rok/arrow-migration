Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should Validate the bitmask is well formed for child arrays (all bits that don't correspond to a slot should be zero).    Once the validate method is added we should be able to make the parent classes method virtual to avoid new implementors missing it.",
