Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing to CSV, timestamp columns error with cast_string not supporting timestamp[ns]. It would be nice to support this cast this via e.g. [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).\r\n\r\nThis happened when trying to use postgres' `COPY ... FROM STDIN WITH CSV`, which is a method to bulk load data into postgres.",

I can't find it on jira, so will just close it as done. Thanks for checking this!"
