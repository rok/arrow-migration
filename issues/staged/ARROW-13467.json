        "title": "[C++] Support delta dictionaries in the IPC file format",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13467](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13467). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe spec states:\r\n\r\n> In the file format, there is no requirement that dictionary keys should be defined in a\r\n> `DictionaryBatch` before they are used in a `RecordBatch`, as long as the keys are\r\n> defined somewhere in the file. Further more, it is invalid to have more than one **non-delta**\r\n> dictionary batch per dictionary ID (i.e. dictionary replacement is not supported). Delta\r\n> dictionaries are applied in the order they appear in the file footer.\r\n\r\nThis seems to suggest that dictionary deltas (but not replacements) are allowed.  However, both reading and writing an IPC file with a dictionary delta fails.",
