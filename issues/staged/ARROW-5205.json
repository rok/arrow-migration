        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5205](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5205). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn a number of places if a string filepath is passed, it is assumed to be a local file. Since we are developing better support for file URIs, we may be able to detect that the user has passed an unsupported URI (e.g. something starting with \"s3:\" or \"hdfs:\") and return a better error message than \"local file not found\"\r\n\r\nsee\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/55704943/what-could-be-the-explanation-of-this-pyarrow-lib-arrowioerror/55707311#55707311",

Since the C++ library will be handling the local/remote file interface, it might make sense to have it either report a better error message (which would bubble up to Python, R, et al.) or perhaps just attempt to\u00a0connect to the remote files."

We certainly did some effort on this topic in the datasets (eg we now have a `pyarrow.fs._resolve_filesystem_and_path` that has some logic to check if a plain path is available as a local file or not), but I don't know for sure if we already use this helper in all IO methods (eg from a quick check, I think `feather.read_feather` doesn't use that)."
