Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, ArrayFromJSON can only produce timestamps from numbers.\r\n\r\nThis is an impediment for writing tests for JSON and CSV, since those formats parse timestamps from strings and it's not immediately obvious that \"2000-20-29\" corresponds to 951782400",
