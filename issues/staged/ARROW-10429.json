        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10429](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10429). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter this commit to add to_date function in Gandiva: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/f1f4001660a634c311a1580160823bc645806273>, the Travis build started failing due to the TEST_F(TestProjector, TestToDate) test in projector_test.\u00a0It passed during CI but only fails in travis-xenial.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere it runs on docker image,\u00a0so it is likely that it only fails inside that docker image. The base image for docker that we use is an old centos version so its probably some new C++ feature not yet supported in the earlier C++ compiler. That's why it fails during compilation.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",
