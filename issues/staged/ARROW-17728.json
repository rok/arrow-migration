Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe MinGW C++ builds have started failing very recently with (seemingly) unrelated CMake configuration failures. Example:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/actions/runs/3052791203/jobs/4922591671\r\n\r\nThis is happened MSYS2 provides LLVM 15 and Apache Arrow C++ doesn't accept LLVM 15 yet.",
