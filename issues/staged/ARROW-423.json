Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently CMake generators like `ninja` don't work anymore because of the missing source of libraries such as `libgtest.a`. In CMake 3.2 the property `BUILD_BYPRODUCTS` was added to declare by-products of the external projects. This is needed for non-lazy build-tree dependency resolution in ninja.",
