        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18316](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18316). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Travis+Migrations\r\n\r\n> On November 2nd, 2020, Travis-CI announced the end of unlimited support for open source projects.\n> \n> Infra is therefore moving our CI offerings away from Travis-CI in order to keep our builds pipeline  cost-effective\n> \n> Deadline: December 31st 2022\n> \n> Infrastructure is moving ASF projects away from using Travis-CI at the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nWe need to migrate jobs in `.travis.yml` to `dev/tasks/`. `dev/tasks/` are triggered by Crossbow. And Crossbow used in apache/arrow ( https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/ ) can still use Travis CI ( https://app.travis-ci.com/github/ursacomputing/crossbow ) because the Travis CI account is sponsored by Voltron Data not ASF.",
