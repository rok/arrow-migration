Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm able to successfully install\u00a0the C++ and Python libraries from\u00a0conda-forge, then successfully install the R package\u00a0from CRAN if\u00a0I use `--no-test-load`. But after installation, the R package fails to load because `dyn.load(\"arrow.so\")` fails. It throws this error when loading:\r\n```java\n\r\nunable to load shared object '~/R/arrow/libs/arrow.so':\r\n /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.11' not found (required by ~/.conda/envs/python3.6/lib/libarrow.so.14)\r\n```\r\nDo the Arrow C++ libraries actually require GCC 7.1.0 / CXXABI_1.3.11? If not, what might explain this error message? Thanks.",
