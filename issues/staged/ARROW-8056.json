How feasible is it for orc file format to be support with read / write capabilities?",

One bit of complexity is that you'd need to make it conditionally available based on whether Arrow C++ was built with ORC support enabled. AFAICT ORC is not available on Windows. \r\n\r\nThe bigger challenge (or at least effort required) would probably be the C++ dependency building, if we wanted this to be a feature generally available to all (non-Windows) users.

There is one package <https://github.com/vertica/r-dataconnector> that does create R data.frames to orc, however it doesn't appear to be actively maintained.\r\n\r\nTo give abit of context around this feature request. I am currently developing two R packages (<https://github.com/DyfanJones/RAthena> and <https://github.com/DyfanJones/noctua>) that connect to AWS Athena. arrow is used to upload parquet files to AWS S3 and then registered with AWS Athena. I would like to the same with orc files without having to spin up a local spark cluster."
