        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16204](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16204). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile trying to understand a failing test in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12811#discussion_r851128672, I noticed that the `write_dataset` function does not actually always raise an error by default if there is already existing data in the target location.\r\n\r\nThe documentation says it will raise \"if any data exists in the destination\" (which is also what I would expect), but in practice it seems that it does ignore certain file names:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow.dataset as ds\r\ntable = pa.table({'a': [1, 2, 3]})\r\n\r\n# write a first time to new directory: OK\r\n>>> ds.write_dataset(table, \"test_overwrite\", format=\"parquet\")\r\n>>> !ls test_overwrite\r\npart-0.parquet\r\n\r\n# write a second time to the same directory: passes, but should raise?\r\n>>> ds.write_dataset(table, \"test_overwrite\", format=\"parquet\")\r\n>>> !ls test_overwrite\r\npart-0.parquet\r\n\r\n# write a another time to the same directory with different name: still passes\r\n>>> ds.write_dataset(table, \"test_overwrite\", format=\"parquet\", basename_template=\"data-{i}.parquet\")\r\n>>> !ls test_overwrite\r\ndata-0.parquet\tpart-0.parquet\r\n\r\n# now writing again finally raises an error\r\n>>> ds.write_dataset(table, \"test_overwrite\", format=\"parquet\")\r\n...\r\nArrowInvalid: Could not write to test_overwrite as the directory is not empty and existing_data_behavior is to error\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it seems that when checking if existing data exists, it seems to ignore any files that match the basename template pattern.\r\n\r\ncc `[~westonpace]` do you know if this was intentional? (I would find that a strange corner case, and in any case it is also not documented)",
