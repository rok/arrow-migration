Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGiven that when possible we would like to keep Dataset and Table with a similar enough API that allows to perform most convenient operations on Dataset without having to materialise it to a table, it would be good to add proper support for a `Dataset.filter` method like the one we have on `Table.filter`",
