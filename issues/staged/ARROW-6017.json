Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now Flight clients error if the server hands them a Location with an unknown scheme. Also, you can't construct locations with non-gRPC schemes. Since Flight will want to support other transports, we should allow unknown schemes up until a client is constructed for them. This would also make it possible for a Flight service to reference non-Flight services in FlightInfo.",
