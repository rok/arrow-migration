Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed that pandas does not provide a UCS2 wheel for Python 2.7. We're building both UCS2 and UCS4. I am curious if the UCS2 wheels are widely used enough to make this worthwhile",

Perhaps some people self-compile Python in UCS2 mode on Linux...\r\n\r\n`[~xhochy]`"

It is probably a small user base but the overhead for us to build this on release is very small. We should skip it in CI though."
