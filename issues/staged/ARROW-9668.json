Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using\u00a0garrow_numeric_array_compare() to compare arrow array, I got\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0arrow::compute::aggregate::AddSumAvx512AggKernels() \u00a0called.\r\n\r\nBut my compute doesn't support avx512 instructions set, so it crashed and reported:\r\n\r\nProgram terminated with signal 4, Illegal instruction.\r\n\r\n#0\u00a0 0x00007efc082fe1d7 in arrow::compute::aggregate::AddSumAvx512AggKernels(arrow::compute::ScalarAggregateFunction\\*) () from /usr/local/lib64/libarrow.so.200\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs this a bug?\r\n\r\nI found that \u00a0CXX_SUPPORTS_AVX512 flag is decided by whether compiler could compile with\r\n\r\n-march=skylake-avx512 -mbmi2. In my opinion, these options is just tell the compiler try to compile with avx512, if not supported, it doesn't complain anything.",
