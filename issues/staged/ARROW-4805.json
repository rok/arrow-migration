Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe CSV writer should start supporting writing temporal arrays back to disk.\r\n\r\nTo be consistent with norms, we should look at what other libraries do for date and time where the resolution is greater than seconds, and potentially deal with the below:\r\n \\* Is there optionality to how dates are written, or should it always be DD/MM/YYYY.\r\n \\* Should / or - be used?\r\n \\* Should time types be written as HH:MM:SS.ms, or 12345ms, 12345us, 12345ns?\r\n \\* Should timestamps always be written in the ISO8601 JSONlike format?",
