Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA good list of kernels to have would str->bool kernels, similar to:\r\n\r\n<https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalnum>\u00a0and friends.\r\n\r\nI think all but `isidentifier` make sense to have. The semantics of the Python functions seem quite reasonable to have in Arrow, but maybe others can provide feedback if this is a complete/reasonable list to have or not.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if we need more (or less) functions, or if we want more atomic functions, e.g. test for membership in Unicode categories.\u00a0",
