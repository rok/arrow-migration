Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe revdep Crossbow job is currently not functioning correctly. This led to changed behaviour affecting a revdep with the 8.0.0 release, requiring a patch after initial submission.\r\ncc: `[~jonkeane]`\r\n\r\nDue to the time and performance constraints on GHA it does not make sense to have a crossbow job for this. A dockeR job to be able to cleanly run this locally does make sense though, so I renamed the ticket.",

One thing I found while running these is that the {targets} package does not behave well when we use multiple workers when running the revdepchecks. It would be awesome if we could run that one with one worker and then all the others with multiple. "

Even with our few revdeps it takes more than 6 hours(not sure if this also applies to self-hosted runners) which is the hard limit for a GHA step. So we will need to split it up into multiple steps and modify the revdepcheck queue etc.. Or just run it manually prior to release, which of course has the potential to be overlooked (as has happened before)..."
