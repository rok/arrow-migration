Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe parquet.read_table() method in pyarrow 8.0.0 added `schema` parameter which is great for handling timestamps, i.e., they are correctly converted from UTC to the timezone specified in the schema.\r\n\r\nHowever, when `schema` is used together with `filters`, timezone conversion fails with \"Cannot compare timestamp with timezone to timestamp without timezone\" error. This was tested on 2 files created with different versions of spark. The test code, files and the output are attached.",
