Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- Force tests: true fully contains all tests in the false version, so false is redundant\n- The CentOS 7 job previously was useful to catch gcc 4.8 issues, but that's no longer a problem, and the CentOS with devtoolset-8 variant is already tested nightly\n- The Windows builds can be pruned if we test only on current release and development version, which only use UCRT. We test the older build nightly in the r-binary-packages workflow",
