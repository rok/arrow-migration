I'm on ARMv7, so 32-bit. arrow-cpp requires gcc4.9 to compile (I have 8.1), which is not available under my distro's package system, and compiling it is a big hassle due to the sheer number of recursive dependencies that would have to be also compiled and installed. If you make progress I would be very interested in hearing about it."

You might run into problems with the CXX11 ABI but for that you need to set an environment variable to switch to the correct ABI. \n\n@Gerlando mh, that looks ok for me. What is the problem with it?"
