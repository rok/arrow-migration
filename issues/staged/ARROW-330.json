Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe're accumulating a lot of boilerplate for setting various properties (like RPATH on OS X) to make shared libraries work well. We also are not consistently building static libraries (see ARROW-303). We would benefit from a helper macro function to rearrange this cmake code in a more reusable form",
