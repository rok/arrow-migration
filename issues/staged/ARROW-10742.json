        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10742](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10742). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen creating an array from a python sequence using a mask arrow will raise an exception unless:\r\n- mask is a numpy array\n- mask is dtype is bool\n- mask has same length as sequence\n- mask is 1 dimensional\n  \n  [https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d542482bdc6bea8a449f000bdd74de8990c20015/cpp/src/arrow/python/iterators.h#L98-L124](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d542482bdc6bea8a449f000bdd74de8990c20015/cpp/src/arrow/python/iterators.h#L98-L124)\n  \n  But, when creating an array from a numpy array these checks are not done which can lead to surprising results.\n  \n  Example:\n  \n  \n  {code:python}\n  import pytest\n  import pyarrow as pa\n  import numpy as np\n  \n  \n  def test_numpy_masked():\n1. This test fails, because no exceptions are raised\n       n = 100\n       obj = np.arange(n)\n       with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n           arr = pa.array(obj, mask=np.array([None] \\* n, dtype=\"O\"))  # wrong dtype\n       with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n           arr = pa.array(obj, mask=np.array([False] \\* (n // 2)))  # wrong length\n       with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n           arr = pa.array(obj, mask=np.array([False] \\* n, ndmin=2))  # wrong shape\n   \n   \n   def test_sequence_masked():\n1. This test passes, since exceptions are raised as expected\n       n = 100\n       obj = np.arange(n).tolist()\n       with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n           arr = pa.array(obj, mask=np.array([None] \\* n, dtype=\"O\"))  # wrong dtype\n       with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n           arr = pa.array(obj, mask=np.array([False] \\* (n // 2)))  # wrong length\n       with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n           arr = pa.array(obj, mask=np.array([False] \\* n, ndmin=2))  # wrong shape\n   \n   \n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       pytest.main(args=[__file__])\n   \n   {code}\n",
