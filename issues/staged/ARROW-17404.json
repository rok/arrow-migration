Is [ARROW-17081](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17081) cover point (2) por Dataset migration?\n1. Related to (3) point: Do you have some ideas about how do we could implement that?\u00a0\n1.

We can use `find_package(Arrow REQUIRED)` in `CMakeLists.txt` to find installed `libarrow.so`/`libarrow.a`/...\r\n3. Yes. I think that we can produce JNI DLLs easily on Windows too because CMake handles DLL related stuff. But we may need to spend time to prepare Windows CI. As the first step, we need to add a CI job on Windows to `.github/workflows/java.yml` without JNI related stuff. Then we can add JNI related stuff to the added CI job. We also need to add `build-cpp-windows` to `dev/tasks/java-jars/github.yml` to provide jars that support Linux/macOS/Windows."

Because we need to improve our CMake configurations to complete ARROW-17081. For example, ARROW-17081 depends on ARROW-12175 and ARROW-17451. ARROW-17451 is merged but ARROW-12175 isn't merged yet.
