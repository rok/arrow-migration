        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11267](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11267). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFound this while reviewing the fix for ARROW-11239. The reason for the failure seems to be related to the combining of null bitmaps of parent/child data. When I changed `create_list_array` to not include null buffers the test passes.\r\n```java\n\r\n    #[test]\r\n    fn test_list_different_offsets() {\r\n        let a =\r\n            create_list_array(&[Some(&[0, 0]), Some(&[1, 2]), Some(&[3, 4])]);\r\n        let b =\r\n            create_list_array(&[Some(&[1, 2]), Some(&[3, 4]), Some(&[5, 6])]);        let a_slice = a.slice(1, 2);\r\n        let b_slice = b.slice(0, 2);\r\n        test_equal(&a_slice, &b_slice, true);\r\n    } \n```\r\n`[~jorgecarleitao]` [~nevi_me] FYI",
