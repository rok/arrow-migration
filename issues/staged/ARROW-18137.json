        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18137](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18137). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf we could allow TableGroupBy.aggregate to accept no aggregation functions then it would behave like pandas drop_duplicates.\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nt.group_by(['keys', 'values']).aggregate()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did some naive benchmarks and looks like it should be 30% faster than converting to pandas and deduplicating. This was my naive test:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n\u00a0t.append_column('i', pa.array([1]*len(t),pa.int64())).group_by(['keys', 'values']).aggregate([(\"i\", \"max\")]).drop(['i_max'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd on small 5M table it took 245ms while 359ms for t.to_pandas().drop_duplicates()\r\n\r\nActual aggregation without adding dummy column should be\u00a0 even faster still will allow drop_duplicates functionality until better implementation arrives",
