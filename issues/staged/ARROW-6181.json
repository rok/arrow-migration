Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6167\u00a0for backstory. Now that we're on CRAN, we can be less paranoid about build failures getting the package rejected, and we can focus on solidifying the CRAN binary package experience. The macOS binaries for 0.14.1 were built without the C++ library, which we did not expect and cannot reproduce. At this point, it would probably be better to have a failed build than have binaries\u00a0get made but be useless. Plus, word has it that for macOS binary builds, CRAN will retry if they fail for some reason. It's possible that whatever failed for 0.14.1 was transient, and if the build had failed instead of carried on without libarrow, on retry it may have built successfully.",
