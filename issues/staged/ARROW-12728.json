Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImplement count distinct aggregate reusing hash table from hash group by inside of it.\r\n\r\nThis brings support to SQL queries like:\r\nselect a, count(distinct b), count(distinct c) from t group by a\r\n\r\nFor instance to compute count(distinct b), the first group id mapping will give group id based on column a value; then the second group id mapping is done using the key (groupid(a), b) inside count(distinct b) aggregate (similarly for count(distinct c)).\u00a0\r\nAfter all input rows are consumed, the final processing step scans the hash tables based on (groupid(a), b) and updates an array of counts indexed by groupid(a). \r\nThe resulting array of counts represents the output of count distinct aggregate.",

I'd like to take it otherwise to get more familiar with the ExecNode/Grouper infrastructure."
