Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen locally building the `conda-cpp-valgrind` docker image I've realised we are prompting for confirmation:\r\n```java\n\r\n#10 12.35 Confirm changes: [Y/n] \r\n#10 88.01   \n```\r\n\r\nWe should use the -y flag when using mamba install:\r\n```java\n\r\n -y, --yes Do not ask for confirmation.\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change we should no longer see the `Confirm changes` message from mamba.",
