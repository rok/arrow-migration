        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15202](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15202). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`pa.array` supports optimized creation from an object with the `__arrow_array__` method, or from a literal NumPy ndarray. But there's a performance gap if the input object has only an `__array__` method, as it isn't used.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSo the user has to know to call `np.asarray` first. And even if the original object could be extended to support '__arrow_array__`, it doesn't seems like a great workaround if all that method would do is call `pa.array(np.asarray(self))`.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
