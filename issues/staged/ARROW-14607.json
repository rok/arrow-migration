        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14607](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14607). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyarrow currently lacks a group by functionality even though all the building blocks are available. It would be good to expose a very simple to use group_by function leaving more complex use cases to the execution engine once IR execution is available.",
