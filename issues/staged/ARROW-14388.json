I confirmed the test reproduces the issue by reverting the changes in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11465>\u00a0and triggering the segfault.\r\n\r\nI also added an additional check, that I verified does prevent the segfault replacing it with a proper `Invalid(\"Invalid mask type\")` error to catch future regressions.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a way to trigger that error with current codebase on master, so it ends up being uncovered by a test. That's because with current codebase anything that is not a numpy.array gets converted to it so there is no way to end up into that situation normally. Ideally it's a kind of issue I would simulate by monkeypatching, but given that everything runs within Cython I can't monkeypatch `get_values` anyway the check is there and should prevent us from reintroducing the same issue in the future."
