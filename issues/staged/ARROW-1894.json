Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThese should be treated as Buffer-like on serialize. We should consider how to \"box\" the buffers as the appropriate kind of object (Buffer, memoryview, etc.) when being deserialized",

I'm not sure what will be the best way to signal that something's a tensor vs. buffer. We may need to add custom metadata to the Tensor flatbuffer type https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Tensor.fbs#L35"
