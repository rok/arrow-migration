Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowing ARROW-6764, we should try to remove the custom ReadaheadSpooler and use the generic readahead iteration facility instead. This will require reworking the blocking / chunking logic to mimick what is done in the JSON reader.",
