It would be great to be able to do option 3 eventually, but we'd need to do a little work to enable the cast kernels to write into sliced outputs. We will likely want to have the option to either map the chunks independently (which will always be required for string / variable length output) or write output into a single large array. I'll open a JIRA for that (since if the offset is non-zero, the implementations are incorrect)"

We can later optimize for writing into a contiguous output array if we like (after ARROW-1735 is done)"
