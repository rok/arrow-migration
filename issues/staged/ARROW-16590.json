Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe've built up a number of utilities that are based around a row-major encoding.  Understanding these utilities requires a pretty in-depth understanding of this encoding format.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as we start to have external work done on exec nodes I think some of these utilities will be useful to eventually expose externally.\r\n\r\nThis JIRA is for work to refactor the existing row-based utilities and consolidate them into a separate location.",
