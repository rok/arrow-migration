I generated the docs locally with `remote.origin.url=https://github.com/kszucs/arrow`. Do we need to set the git origin remote to apache/arrow before generating the docs?"

We should probably set that option in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/js/typedoc.js and then you don't have to mess with the remote. "
