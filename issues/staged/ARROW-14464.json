Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when `chunk_size` is not given in `write_parquet()` it defaults to 1 chunk of all of the rows in the table. This could be fine for smallish numbers of rows, but when we have lots of rows, we want files that contain a decent number of row groups.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this was added in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5451 and wasn't discussed there, so this default might not be intentional.",
