I was occupied with some other stuff. I also thought I could delay this to yield CI to more critical bugs before the release.\r\n\r\nIt sounds okay to me to close this issue with that PR merged. I'm not sure if it's necessary create a separate PR just for this.\r\n\r\nThere seems a few other points move is used. You may want to replace those in the PR as well:\r\n```java\n\r\n ~/src/ext/arrow/python/pyarrow \ue0b0 \ue0a0 master \ue0b0 grep \"move\" -rnw . | grep -E \".(pyx|pxi|pxd)\"\r\n./_flight.pyx:946:                                               move(handler)))\r\n./_flight.pyx:1358:            new CPyFlightDataStream(result, move(data_stream)))\r\n./_flight.pyx:1485:        new CPyFlightDataStream(result, move(data_stream)))\r\n./includes/libarrow_flight.pxd:378:    unique_ptr[CFlightDataStream] move(unique_ptr[CFlightDataStream]) nogil\r\n./includes/libarrow_flight.pxd:379:    unique_ptr[CServerAuthHandler] move(unique_ptr[CServerAuthHandler]) nogil\r\n./includes/libarrow_flight.pxd:380:    unique_ptr[CClientAuthHandler] move(unique_ptr[CClientAuthHandler]) nogil\r\n./_fs.pyx:249:    def move(self, src, dest):\r\n```\r\ncymove doesn't enforce nogil as it made sense to me to leave decision for the gil to the caller of move (it's just casting after all)."
