The reason is that Breathe in `visit_templateparamlist` tries to parse each template parameter by using Sphinx's DefinitionParser, only if we have Sphinx >= 4.1.0. But Sphinx can't handle `template...`. If we don't have a new enough Sphinx, it'll just append the template parameter as text. Presumably at some point CI updated Sphinx and hence we started failing."
