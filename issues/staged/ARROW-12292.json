Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed at <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9942#issuecomment-815315840,>\u00a0the `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, and `as.character()`\u00a0methods for `ArrowDatum` return R vectors of the specified R types, whereas in dplyr, these same functions perform casts to the analogous Arrow types\u00a0\r\n\r\nCompare the definitions:\r\n \\* `ArrowDatum` methods: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/ace2bfc160e049b4edc7ffb55081cfb7210d6e43/r/R/arrow-datum.R#L139-L145>\r\n \\* dplyr functions: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/f2db785c24015b102db9b268c67a6ea73c5d7e93/r/R/dplyr.R#L399-L432>\r\n\r\nConsider whether the\u00a0`ArrowDatum` methods should instead perform casts but keep the data in Arrow so that the user would have to also call `as.vector()` to return the data as an R vector.",
