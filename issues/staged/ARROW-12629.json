Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are compiling Arrow C++ to WebAssembly and ran into the following issue with the CSV reader:\r\n\r\nBrowsers became very picky about the use of SharedArrayBuffers after the events around Spectre and Meltdown.\r\n\r\nAs a result, you have to compile Arrow to WebAssembly without threads if you don't want to run your website with very strict cross-origin isolation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the CSV reader seems to always spawn a thread for the read-ahead in both, the SerialStreamingReader and the SerialTableReader independent of whether use_threads is set.\r\n\r\nRight now, this effectively means that you cannot use the CSV (and JSON) readers in threadless WebAssembly builds.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/4363fefe46dc357a9013f0f4bcdc235e1e2e8124/cpp/src/arrow/csv/reader.cc#L839>\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/4363fefe46dc357a9013f0f4bcdc235e1e2e8124/cpp/src/arrow/csv/reader.cc#L913>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
