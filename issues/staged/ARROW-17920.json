Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[ARROW-14440] [C++][FlightRPC] Add example of registering gRPC service on a Flight server - ASF JIRA (apache.org)\u00a0\r\n\r\nRelated to the above issue, a portion of the issue notes that currently it is impossible in python for a server implementing FSB to extend to other gRPC messages. While I haven't verified that claim, it seems to be valid.\r\n\r\nComplete composability in python of an arbitrary gRPC service + FlightServer might not be a goal, but rather one possible way to implement a useful production flightserver that responds appropriately to [k8s-style health probes\\|[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command].]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA concrete ask perhaps more idiomatic to FSB is overridable default implementations of [gRPC health check messages\\|[https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md#grpc-health-checking-protocol],] which would allow \"simple\" python derivations of FlightServerBase to be served in production environments (including k8s above which is adding support for the generic gRPC health checking protocol).",
