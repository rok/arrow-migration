        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11622](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11622). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have an aggregate query and the AggregateExpr has this name\r\n```java\n\r\n SUM(l_extendedprice Multiply Int64(1))\n```\r\nThis is hiding the fact that the expression has a CAST operation:\r\n```java\n\r\n expr: BinaryExpr { left: Column { name: \"l_extendedprice\" }, op: Multiply, right: CastExpr { expr: Literal { value: Int64(1) }, cast_type: Float64 } }, nullable: true }\n```\r\nIn Ballista, this causes a problem with serde because after a rountrip, the expression has a name that includes the CAST and this causes a schema mismatch.\r\n```java\n\r\nSUM(l_extendedprice Multiply CAST(Int64(1) AS Float64)) \n```",
