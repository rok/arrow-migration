Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe de-facto practice is to use -1 in FlightInfo to indicate that the number of records/size of the payload is unknown, looking at the Java implementation. However, the Protobuf definition uses an unsigned integer type, as does the C++ implementation.",
