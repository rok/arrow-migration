        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13366](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13366). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the `is_nan`\u00a0C++ kernel returns `null`\u00a0on `null`\u00a0values. Consider adding a boolean option to this kernel\u00a0to control whether to consider `null`\u00a0as `NaN`.\u00a0This would allow the code added in\u00a0ARROW-12850 to be much simplified.",
