        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5572](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5572). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56522977/using-predicates-to-filter-rows-from-pyarrow-parquet-parquetdataset\r\n\r\nFor example, when specifying a column in the filter which is a normal column and not a key in your partitioned folder hierarchy, the filter gets silently ignored. It would be nice to get an error message for this.  \r\nReproducible example:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a': [0, 0, 1, 1], 'b': [0, 1, 0, 1], 'c': [1, 2, 3, 4]})\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\npq.write_to_dataset(table, 'test_parquet_row_filters', partition_cols=['a'])\r\n# filter on 'a' (partition column) -> works\r\npq.read_table('test_parquet_row_filters', filters=[('a', '=', 1)]).to_pandas()\r\n# filter on normal column (in future could do row group filtering) -> silently does nothing\r\npq.read_table('test_parquet_row_filters', filters=[('b', '=', 1)]).to_pandas()\r\n```",
