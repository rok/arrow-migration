Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf I build gandiva alone, I get a link error saying OpenSSL related definitions are not found. After some digging, I found out that `ARROW_USE_OPENSSL` is only turned on if any of the following conditions is met: `PARQUET_REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION`, `ARROW_FLIGHT`, `ARROW_S3`. Adding `ARROW_GANDIVA` to the list solves this issue.",
