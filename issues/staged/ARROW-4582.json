Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen converting DataFrames with numerical columns to Arrow tables we were seeing random segfaults in core Python code. This only happened in environments where we had a high level of parallelisation or slow code execution (e.g. in AddressSanitizer builds).\r\n\r\nThe reason for these segfaults was that we were incrementing the reference count of the underlying NumPy buffer but were not holding the GIL while changing the reference count.",
