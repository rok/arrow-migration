Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-14908 we solved the case of joining a dataset to an in memory table, but did not solve joining two datasets.\r\n\r\nThe previous solution was to add +1 to the thread count, because the hash join logic might be called by the scanner's IO thread. For joining more than 1 dataset, we might have more than 1 IO thread, so we either need to add a larger arbitrary number or find a way to make the state logic more resilient to unexpected threads.",
