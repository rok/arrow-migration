Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-14071 and ARROW-16444 cover evaluating user-defined functions in different ways, but could we extend this behaviour so it be possible to evaluate generics?  Here's an example of how that works in dplyr from a [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73950714/is-it-possible-to-use-generics-in-apache-arrow):\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\ndf <- data.frame(a = c(\"these\", \"are\", \"some\", \"strings\"),\r\n                 b = 1:4)\r\n\r\nboop <- function(x, ...) UseMethod(\"boop\", x)\r\n\r\nboop.numeric <- function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)\r\n\r\nboop.character <- function(x) mean(nchar(x), na.rm =TRUE )\r\n\r\ndf %>% summarise(across(everything(), boop))\r\n```\r\n",
