Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee the discussion [here\\|[https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5280#discussion_r323896532]]. We are currently reading message lengths using machine dependent endianness. Should this be changed to little-endian all the time?\r\n\r\nIt appears the C++ implementation does this same thing - use machine dependent endianness.",
