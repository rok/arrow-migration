        "title": "[C++][FlightRPC] Missing protobuf data_body should result in default value of empty bytes, not null",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10960](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10960). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n# Problem\r\n\r\nProtoBuf `proto3` specifies that [if a message does not contain a particular singular element, the field should get the default value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#default). However, when the C++ `flight-test-integration-server` gets a `DoPut` request with a `FlightData` message for a record batch containing no items, and the `FlightData` is missing the `data_body` field, the server responds with an error \"Expected body in IPC message of type record batch\".\r\n\r\n## What happens\r\n\r\nIf I run the C++ `flight-test-integration-server` and the C++ `flight-test-integration-client` with the `generated_null_trivial` test case, the test passes and I see the protobuf in wireshark shown in the cpp-client-empty-data-body.png attachment.\r\n\r\nNote the `data_body` field is present but has no value.\r\n\r\nIf I run the Rust `flight-test-integration-client` that I'm working on developing, it does not send the `data_body` field at all if there are no bytes to send. I see the protobuf in wireshark shown in the rust-client-missing-data-body.png attachment.\r\n\r\nNote the `data_body` field is not present.\r\n\r\nThe C++ server then returns the error message \"Expected body in IPC message of type record batch\", which comes from [this check for message body](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/519e9da4fc1698f686525f4226295f3680a3f3db/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/reader.cc#L92) called in [`ReadNext` of the record batch stream reader](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/519e9da4fc1698f686525f4226295f3680a3f3db/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/reader.cc#L787).\r\n\r\n##  What I expect to happen\r\n\r\nInstead of returning an error message because of a null pointer, the Message should get the default value of empty bytes.\r\n",
