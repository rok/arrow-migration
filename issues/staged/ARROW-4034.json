Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that the PR (#1978) that resolved Issue #2018 has not cascaded down through the existing ruby interface.\r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with variations of the `write-file.rb` examples, but passing in the append flag as true (`Arrow::FileOutputStream.open(\"/tmp/file.arrow\", true)`) still results in overwriting the file, and trying the newer interface using truncate and append flags throws `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (3 for 2)`.",
