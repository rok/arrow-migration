        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2073](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2073). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowing ARROW-1705, we should support calling `pa.array` with a sequence of tuples, presuming a struct type is passed for the `type` parameter.\r\n\r\nWe also probably want to disallow mixed inputs, e.g. a sequence of both dicts and tuples. The user should use only one idiom at a time.",
