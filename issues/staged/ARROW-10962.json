Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo be compatible with Protobuf implementations, missing fields should not be treated as an error. The C++ implementation has the same issue, and this is causing issues with the C# and Rust implementations (and presumably the Go implementation)",
