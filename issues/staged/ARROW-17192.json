So when you write to a feather file the pandas dataframe gets converted to an arrow table and the conversion infers the datetime to microsecond resolution.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs a workaround you can use `feather.read_table` to read the feather file into an Arrow table and then use `to_pandas` to convert it into a pandas dataframe, but you will have to add `timestamp_as_object=True` keyword so that PyArrow doesn't try to convert the timestamp to `{}datetime64[ns]{`}:\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> feather.read_table(\"to_trash.feather\").to_pandas(timestamp_as_object=True)\r\n                  date\r\n0  1654-01-01 00:00:00\r\n1  1920-01-01 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nBut I think we should still pass through `**kwargs` in `read_feather` to `to_pandas()` so that one could specify `timestamp_as_object=True` keyword there also. So I am keeping the Jira open and will try to make a PR for it in the following week. Contributions are also welcome, I can help if needed."
