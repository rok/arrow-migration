Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn R/deprecated.R we have a few deprecated functions that have been deprecated for some time. In ARROW-15168 we deprecated `type()` in favour of `infer_type()`, and there are a few deprecated methods in dataset.R as well. We should consider removing some of the older deprecations and for the newer ones, we should probably add a comment about when they were deprecated so that we can better schedule their removal (or adopt tidyverse lifecycle terminology: https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html ).",
