Issue shows closed, and I see there have been some PR's in the past, but it wasn't clear if anything was merged. Regardless, when I attempt to collect a float32 value from Spark to R, I get the following warning. Is something that would make sense for me to open a new issue?\r\n```r\n\r\nstr(collect(SparkR::sql(\"SELECT float('1') AS x;\"))$x[[1]])\r\n## num 1\r\n\r\n## Warning message:In value[[3L]](cond) :  The conversion from Spark DataFrame to R DataFrame was attempted with Arrow optimization because 'spark.sql.execution.arrow.sparkr.enabled' is set to true; however, failed, attempting non-optimization. Reason: Error in checkSchemaInArrow(schema(x)): Arrow optimization in R does not support float type yet.\r\n```"
