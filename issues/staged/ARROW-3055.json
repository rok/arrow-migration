The idea was that when a byte is `0xFF` or `0x0` that you could return true/false always in `IsSet/IsNotSet`. So the implementation of `IsSet` would become\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  bool IsSet() const { return byte_all_set_ || (current_byte_ & (1 << bit_offset_)) != 0; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the additional labor of determining `byte_all_set_` negates any performance gains, but it would be worthwhile to determine for certain"
