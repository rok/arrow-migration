Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n**Conclusion**: we will implement this in the R bindings - month will allow integer input: `month(int)` will return `int` as long as `int` is between 1 and 12.\r\n==================================\r\nIn R, more specifically in `{}lubridate{`}, `month()` can be used both to get and set the corresponding component of a date. This means `month()` accepts integer inputs.\r\n```r\n\r\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate)) \r\nmonth(1:12)\r\n#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\r\nmonth(1:13)\r\n#> Error in month.numeric(1:13): Values are not in 1:12\r\n```\r\nSolving this would allow us to implement bindings such as `semester()` in a manner closer to `{}lubridate{`}.\r\n```r\n\r\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\r\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))\r\n\r\ntest_df <- tibble(\r\n  month_as_int = c(1:12, NA),\r\n  month_as_char_pad = ifelse(month_as_int < 10, paste0(\"0\", month_as_int), month_as_int),\r\n  dates = as.Date(paste0(\"2021-\", month_as_char_pad, \"-15\"))\r\n)\r\n\r\ntest_df %>%\r\n  mutate(\r\n    sem_date = semester(dates),\r\n    sem_month_as_int = semester(month_as_int))\r\n#> # A tibble: 13 \u00d7 5\r\n#>    month_as_int month_as_char_pad dates      sem_date sem_month_as_int\r\n#>           <int> <chr>             <date>        <int>            <int>\r\n#>  1            1 01                2021-01-15        1                1\r\n#>  2            2 02                2021-02-15        1                1\r\n#>  3            3 03                2021-03-15        1                1\r\n#>  4            4 04                2021-04-15        1                1\r\n#>  5            5 05                2021-05-15        1                1\r\n#>  6            6 06                2021-06-15        1                1\r\n#>  7            7 07                2021-07-15        2                2\r\n#>  8            8 08                2021-08-15        2                2\r\n#>  9            9 09                2021-09-15        2                2\r\n#> 10           10 10                2021-10-15        2                2\r\n#> 11           11 11                2021-11-15        2                2\r\n#> 12           12 12                2021-12-15        2                2\r\n#> 13           NA <NA>              NA               NA               NA\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently attempts to use `month()` with integer inputs errors with:\r\n```r\n\r\nFunction 'month' has no kernel matching input types (array[int32])\r\n```",

Arrow does not have a \"month array\" concept so month(int) is expected to fail. Are you expecting to do month(int) -> duration?"

In my case the implementation of semester extraction goes through `month()`, and also supports integer inputs (in addition to dates and date times). \r\nI haven't started looking into the `duration` type in lubridate - there lubridate has `dmonths` which could be used to create a `duration` object corresponding to a timespan of x months.
