        "title": "[C++][Flight] Incorrect Arrow Flight benchmark output",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7411](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7411). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen running Arrow Flight benchmark in the following scenario, the output is incorrect. \r\n```Java\n\r\n$ ./arrow-flight-perf-server &\r\n[1] 12986\r\nServer host: localhost\r\nServer port: 31337\r\n$ ./arrow-flight-benchmark -server_host localhost -test_put \r\nUsing remote server: true\r\nTesting method: DoPut\r\nServer host: localhost\r\nServer port: 31337\r\nBytes read: 1280000000\r\nNanos: 496372147\r\nSpeed: 2459.25 MB/s\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Using remote server` should be `false` and `Bytes read` should be `Bytes write`.\r\n\r\nTo correct the result of `Using remote server`, we can:\r\n\r\n- Change `if (FLAGS_server_host == \"\")` to another condition which checks if there is already an `arrow-flight-perf-server` running. This is a bit complicated to do and might add some unnecessary complexity (e.g. we need to make sure it support all OSes.).\u00a0\n  \n- Delete `Using remote server`, since we already have `Server host` in the output.\n  \n  I personally prefer the second option and will make a PR.",
