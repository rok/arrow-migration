Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe compression level selected in Arrow for ZSTD is 1 which is the minimal compression level for the compressor. This leads to very high compression speed at the sacrifice of compression ratio.\r\n\r\nThe user should be allowed to select the compression level as both speed and ratio are data specific.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to expose the knob via an environment variable such as ARROW_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL.\r\n Example:\r\n export ARROW_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=10\r\n ./my_parquet_app\r\n\r\nHere is a test run with compression levels of 1, 2 and 5:\r\nLevel\u00a0 \u00a0Time (s)\u00a0 \u00a0Size (mb)\r\n1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a013.02\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0181\r\n2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 13.10\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0177\r\n5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a019.44\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0148",
