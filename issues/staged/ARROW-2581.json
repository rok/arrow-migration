Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, many vectors have \"reset()\" methods but it's not part of the vector interface and is not implemented by all vectors (e.g. ListVector doesn't have a reset method). I think a similar interface to \"clear()\" would be a good improvement.",
