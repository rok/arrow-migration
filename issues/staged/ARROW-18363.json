        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18363](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18363). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow we have versioned docs, we also have the old versions of the developers docs (eg https://arrow.apache.org/docs/9.0/developers/guide/communication.html). Those might be outdated (eg regarding communication channels, build instructions, etc), and typically when contributing / developing with the latest arrow, one should _always_ check the latest dev version of the contributing docs.\r\n\r\nWe could add a warning box pointing this out and linking to the dev docs. \r\n\r\nFor example similarly how some projects warn about viewing old docs in general and point to the stable docs (eg https://mne.tools/1.1/index.html or https://scikit-learn.org/1.0/user_guide.html). In this case we could have a custom box when at a page in /developers to point to the dev docs instead of stable docs",

I think it would only still be nice if we can special case pages in the /developers section, so that for those pages we can 1) point to the dev docs instead of stable docs, and 2) also show this warning for the stable version."
