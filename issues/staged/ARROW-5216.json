Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was trying to see what was running in appveyor and couldn't find it. Kriszti\u00e1n helped me to find\u00a0<https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow>, but it would be nice to add the badge to the README next to the Travis-CI one for a quick link to it (as well as showing off build status).\r\n\r\nI was just going to add it myself, but unlike Travis, you can't guess the Appveyor badge URL from the project name because they have a hash in them; only someone with sufficient privileges on the project in Appveyor can get to the settings panel to find the URL.",
