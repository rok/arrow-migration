Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[conda-recipes/pyarrow\\|[https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/dev/tasks/conda-recipes/pyarrow]] has S3 and some others enabled, but [conda-forge/pyarrow/feedstock\\|[https://github.com/conda-forge/pyarrow-feedstock/tree/master/recipe]] does not. It seems like `bld.bat` and `build.sh` in conda-forge feedstock are outdated.",
