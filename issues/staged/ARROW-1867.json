Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe new BitVector class after the refactoring does not have some of the APIs from the previous class such as `setRangeToOnes`, etc.  Also, I believe `getNullCount` returned the number of zeros in the vector.",
