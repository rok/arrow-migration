Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDownloading and building third-party libraries may be consuming a significant chunk of time in our CI chain. It would be nice to cache third-party build artifacts accross CI builds, to save time.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I ran accross weird issues (especially on Windows / AppVeyor) when trying to implement this. I don't plan to waste any more time on this soon. Attempt at <https://github.com/apache/arrow/compare/master...pitrou:externals_dir>\r\n\r\nEdit: it seems I finally found the issue on Windows: ninja is case-sensitive, you must be careful to canonicalize paths yourself in custom CMake commands such as in ExternalProject_Add...",

I posted on the CMake mailing-list:\r\nhttps://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2018-September/068177.html\r\n\r\nIt seems that one factor is in-source builds (the `BUILD_IN_SOURCE` option to `ExternalProject_Add`), which render the source tree \"dirty\"."
