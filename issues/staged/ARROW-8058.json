Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis can be costly and is not always necessary.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we could move file validation into the scan tasks; currently all files are inspected as the dataset is constructed, which can be expensive if the filesystem is slow. We'll be performing the validation multiple times but the check will be cheap since at scan time we'll be reading the file into memory anyway.",
