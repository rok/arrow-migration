The ticket was originally meant to provide an entry point for people that want to get started with \"Arrow\". So something like <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/getstarted.html> that introduces them to what Arrow is about, what you can do with it and then links to the more in-depth sections for additional details.\r\n\r\nSo the Install Guide is definitely appreciated, but we also need a landing/introductory page for people viewing arrow for the first time."

The Getting Started section should have no more than a mention and a quick example of the major features (in case of java I'd say `{}ValueVector{`}, `{}VectorSchemaRoot{`}, `{}RW IPC{`}) and then a link to their relative sections for additional details."
