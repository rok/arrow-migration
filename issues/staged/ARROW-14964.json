Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a diversity of utilities for writing kernels in `codegen_internal.h`. Many have to do with actual code generation, but some have to do with type promotions, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to split away the utilities that don't have to do with code generation in separate headers. It would make the utilities easier to navigate, as the code generation utilities are quite long.",
