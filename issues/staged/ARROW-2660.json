        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2660](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2660). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPEP 574 has an implementation ready and a PyPI-available backport (at <https://pypi.org/project/pickle5/> ). Adding experimental support for it would allow for zero-copy pickling of Arrow arrays, columns, etc.\r\n\r\nI think it mainly involves implementing `reduce_ex` on the `Buffer` class, as described in <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0574/#producer-api>\r\n\r\nIn addition, the consumer API added by PEP 574 could be used in Arrow's serialization layer, to avoid or minimize copies when serializing foreign objects.",
