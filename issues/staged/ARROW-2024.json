Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should get rid of the global variables `{{_default_serialization_context`}}\u00a0and `{{pandas_serialization_context`}}\u00a0and replace them with functions `{{default_serialization_context()`}}\u00a0and `{{pandas_serialization_context()`}}.\r\n\r\nThis will also make it faster to do `{{import pyarrow`}}.",
