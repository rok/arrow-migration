Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the [C++ documentation of compute functions](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/cpp/compute.rst), in-table references to notes are placed inconsistently. Some tables have a **Notes** column while others embed note references with corresponding text. To be consistent, use the **Notes** column approach.\r\n\r\nAlso, the raw syntax for in-table references is inconsistent. Some cases use **(1)** while others use **&#92;(1)**.",
