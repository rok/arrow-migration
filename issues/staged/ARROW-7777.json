Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBoth StructBuilder and ListBuilder improperly call init() on sub-builders when they should be calling Reserve. For ListBuilder this occurs on the offsets builder. For StructBuilder it occurs on each of the field builders. This results in a panic from index out of range on Append.",
