        "title": "[C++] Add support for pushdown filtering of nested references",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16275). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow that we support nested field references we should support pushdown predicates based on nested field references.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\ndataset.to_table(filter=ds.field('values', 'one') > 200)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`file_parquet.cc` tests which row groups to include when scanning a parquet fragment using parquet statistics.  At the moment it skips any non-leaf columns.  That will need to change.\r\n\r\nSecond, even if we were able to detect and produce a guarantee based on nested references, it's not clear the simplification logic would be able to detect this and appropriately simplify.  So there may be changes needed there too.",
