        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17981](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17981). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee the followings for the underlying problem:\r\n- ARROW-15664\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15678?focusedCommentId=17613909#comment-17613909\n  \n  We're using the following approaches for this problem:\n- Template: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15678?focusedCommentId=17524280#comment-17524280\n- Optimization flags: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14342\n  \n  It may be better that we use one common approach (the optimization flags approach) for this problem.\n  \n  At first, we need to take a look at codes that may related to this problem to consider whether we can use the optimization flags approach. If we can use the optimization flags approach, we need to create a new CMake function for the approach and use it for each code.",
