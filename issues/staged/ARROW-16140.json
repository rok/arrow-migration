Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe conversion itself works fine (eg when specifying `type=pa.timestamp(\"us\", tz=\"America/New_York\")` in the below example), but inferring the type and timezone from the first value fails if it has a zoneinfo timezone:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [53]: tz = zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='America/New_York')\r\n\r\nIn [54]: dt = datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 3, 10, 3, 14, tzinfo = tz)\r\n\r\nIn [55]: pa.array([dt])\r\n....\r\nArrowInvalid: Object returned by tzinfo.utcoffset(None) is not an instance of datetime.timedelta\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc `[~alenkaf]`",
