        "title": "[Python] DataFrame Index modified during Feather serialization round trip",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15018](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15018). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome (or all) indexes are converted to a\u00a0`RangeIndex` after a Feather serialization/deserialization round trip. I came across this in pyarrow 3.0.0 and 6.0.1 for both a `MultiIndex`\u00a0and an empty dataframe (`{}Dataframe.index{`} -> `{}RangeIndex{`}).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDesired behavior: A dataframe with any type of index would be supported and a serialization/deserialization round trip would preserve the index and yield an identical dataframe\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to modify priority and issue type as appropriate, thanks!",
