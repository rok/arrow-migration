Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt looks like the fix that I thought would work in DuckDB did not, in fact fix the error! The previous ticket, ARROW-17643, just skipped the test until the new release of duckdb (which just happened).",
