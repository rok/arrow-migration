        "title": "[Plasma] Add higher level API for putting and getting Python objects",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1412](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1412). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow that we can serialize Python objects in Arrow, let's include a slightly higher level API to the plasma Python bindings that exposes storing Python objects in Plasma (we also need this for Ray).\n\nThe API I'd like to propose is very simple:\n\ndef put(PlasmaClient client, value, object_id=None)\n\nPuts the Python object value into the store and returns the Object ID associated with it. If object_id is set, use that one instead of generating a random one.\n\ndef get(PlasmaClient client, object_ids, timeout_ms=-1):\n\nReturns a list of Python objects represented by the Object IDs.\n\nLet me know if you have feedback or thoughts!",
