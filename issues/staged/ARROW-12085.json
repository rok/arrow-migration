A downloaded `cmake` for x86 is called, which cannot be executed on the ppc platform. However, that error is silently ignored, the installation continues.\r\n\r\nBuilding of `arrow.so` and installing the R code works. I'm calling install.packages in a conda environment that has pyarrow and arrow-cpp already installed. After installing the matching Arrow 3.0.0 from CRAN, I can load and use it. Passing data between the R API and the Python API via reticulate works, too.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, I can collect some installation log output.\r\n\r\nSomething to keep in mind for the ppc platform is that there are different system page sizes in use. The arrow builds from conda-forge don't work on RedHat because of that."

It does not look like a cmake binary is available to download at https://cmake.org/download/, so we can't get one on the fly, but you should be able to install it on your system prior to building arrow."
