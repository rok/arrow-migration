        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7914](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7914). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSorry in advance if I mess anything up. This is my first issue.\r\n\r\nI have hourly data for 3 years using a\u00a0 Pandas datetime as the index. Pandas allows me load/save .csv with the following code (only one month with 2 variables shown):\r\n`\r\n# Write data to .csv\r\n\r\njan90.to_csv('PEC fine course 1 grid 199001.csv', index=True)\r\n# Load data from .csv\r\n\r\njan90 = pd.read_csv('PEC fine course 1 grid 199001.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)\r\n`\r\nUsing .csv works, but is slow when I get to the full dataset of 26k+ rows and 21.6k+ columns (and more columns may be coming if I have to add lags to my data). So, a more efficient load/save routine is very desirable. I was excited when I found feather, but the lost index is a no-go for my use.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.",
