            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6792?focusedCommentId=16969593) by Neal Richardson (npr):*\nI took a look at this in the course of writing documentation for ARROW-6340. Some observations:\r\n\r\n- It's all or nothing. If we use the new roxygen at all, we have to update all of our existing docs. In that PR I added `r6 = FALSE` to the RoxygenNote to keep the old behavior for now.\n- The first disqualifying feature I noticed is the that the new R6 stuff doesn't like how we documented several classes in the same file. It just repeats \"Super classes\" and \"Methods\" sections down the page. See https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/961.\n- Bad crossreferences (reported https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1177)"
