Maybe we could change this to\u00a0r\"</sup>~~?(\\d+\\.\\d+)(e~~?(\\d+))?$\" or similar stuff to allow scientific notation of real number inferred as float?\r<br>\r<br>\u00a0\r<br>\r<br>(The RE I currently proposed doesn't handle \"5e-4\" correctly though)\r<br>\r<br>\u00a0\r<br>\r<br>And I would wish we could infer \"3.\" or \".3\" as float too. I will come up with an exact RE when I get time.\r<br>\r<br>\u00a0|\n",
