        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15827](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15827). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using `write_dataset()`, if we set `max_rows_per_file` without also setting `max_rows_per_group`, we always get the error shown below.  \r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\ntd <- tempfile()\r\ndir.create(td)\r\nwrite_dataset(mtcars, td, max_rows_per_file = 5L)\r\n#> Error: Invalid: max_rows_per_group must be less than or equal to max_rows_per_file\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should change the behaviour so we can specify one without having to also specify the other.\r\n",
