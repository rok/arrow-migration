        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12188). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have been working on using a new theme (the [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with some custom styling for Arrow) for the sphinx documentation.\r\n\r\nInitially, I tried out a few variants (see below), but unless more people give their preference, I will keep the layout the same as it is now (a single sidebar, option 3 below).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nA few options for the layout, with a preview that I pushed to github pages:\r\n\r\n1. Navbar + sidebar: the navbar contains the main sections (format, libraries, development), and then the sidebar further up to each page. \r\n Two example links: <https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/arrow-docs-preview/html-option-1/format/CDataInterface.html> and <https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/arrow-docs-preview/html-option-1/python/parquet.html>\r\n\r\n2. Navbar with dropdown + sidebar: similar as above, but with an additional dropdown for the different libraries (languages). As a consequence, the sidebar only contains the items for one language (eg python) at a time (giving a better view if you're only looking at the python docs IMO, but needs more clicks to switch to another language). \r\n The same two example links: <https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/arrow-docs-preview/html-option-2-dropdown/format/CDataInterface.html>, <https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/arrow-docs-preview/html-option-2-dropdown/python/parquet.html> (note that this option definitely still needs a better clue that you are eg in the python sub-part of the docs)\r\n\r\n3. Only sidebar: this is similar in structure to what we have today with the RTD theme. \r\n The same two example links: <https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/arrow-docs-preview/html-option-3-single-sidebar/format/CDataInterface.html>, <https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/arrow-docs-preview/html-option-3-single-sidebar/python/parquet.html>\r\n\r\nLastly, I also made a option 4 that uses a single sidebar as option 3, but with a dropdown to choose the topic: https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/arrow-docs-preview/html-option-4-sidebar-with-dropdown/format/CDataInterface.html, https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/arrow-docs-preview/html-option-4-sidebar-with-dropdown/python/parquet.html\r\n\u00a0\r\nProbably those previews can be further improved with some additional (CSS) tweaks. I \"just\" took the orange-like color that is also used on the home page as the main color for the navigation, to give it a bit a custom touch.\r\nBut so feedback on both which general structure you like most as details you would like to see improved is certainly welcome.\r\n\r\nAn additional question is if we want to integrate this somehow with the navbar we already have from the home page.\r\n",

They might look cleaner, but it's annoying having to guess where to click to navigate (especially in #1 where everything is hidden under a very subtle dropdown).\r\n\r\nI wouldn't mind #4 but it's easier to ctrl-F for something in #3. And while minor, #4 obscures that some of the language docs are not under Sphinx."

So the PR I opened (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9876) is implementing #3, which seems what most people like the most\r\n\r\n> especially in #1 where everything is hidden under a very subtle dropdown\r\n\r\n`[~lidavidm]` which dropdown do you mean?

I personally like that \"idea\", but I am not yet sure how it could work in practice in combination with #3"

Now it's only the sub-part with the navigation that scrolls, keeping the logo and search box always in view. Another option is to have the full sidebar scroll (so when scrolling down to look at the navigation items, the logo will scroll away). That would make the \"view\" on the navigation a bit larger when scrolling down (as now it's smaller because the logo is always there)."
