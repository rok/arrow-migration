Let's use \"column\" instead of \"array\".\r\n\r\n`GArrowColumn` is consists of a field and chunked arrays. `GArrowTable` represents a logical table from different size physical arrays (`GArrowChunkedArray` s). A record batch represents a physical table from the same size physical arrays (`GArrowArray` s)."
