        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10402](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10402). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, equality between two arrays requires downcasting the array to the correct type before comparing them. This is not very ergonomic.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this is that array equality currently depends on the concrete types. I.e. the actual calculations depend on the concrete type.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this task is to simplify array equality by making it independent of the concrete type that the array depends on.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
