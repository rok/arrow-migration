Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith [https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2016](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2016#pullrequestreview-121047089)\u00a0we provide a convenience docker container so that one can develop Arrow but does not directly run into the hassles of setting up the development on chain his machine.\r\n\r\nThe current base image is not build automatically as we are waiting for input from INFRA on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-16533\r\n\r\nOnce we know how to upload continously to docker hub, we should move the Dockerfile appropriately.",

User then should be able to pull with `docker pull apache/arrow-dev`. You will only get the apache prefix though if it's an automated build through the docker hub infrastructure.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor the `manylinux1` image we use at the <https://quay.io/repository/xhochy/arrow_manylinux1_x86_64_base>\u00a0which is done via my arrow fork (I gave various PMC member write access to it but that's still suboptimal)."
