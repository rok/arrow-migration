        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9854](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9854). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent S3 support is limited to (1) being able to instantiate an S3FileSystem object, primarily from a URI, and (2) ability to open_dataset from an S3 URI. Before widely declaring that we support S3 in R, we should be able to:\r\n\r\n- download dataset (i.e. copy files/directory recursively)\n- read_parquet/feather/etc. from S3 (use FileSystem->OpenInputFile(path))\n- write_$FORMAT via FileSystem->OpenOutputStream(path)\n- write_dataset\n- for linux, an argument to install_arrow to help, assuming you've installed aws-sdk-cpp already (turn on ARROW_S3, AWSSDK_SOURCE=SYSTEM)\n- testing with minio on CI\n- set up a real test bucket and user for e2e testing\n- update docs and vignettes",
