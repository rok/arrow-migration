Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have table with a column, let\u2019s call the column c. c.type returns Decimal {scale: 3, precision: 12}. c.get(0) returns [519500, 0, 0, 0]. I know the value should be 519.5. After much digging, I found that the value is actually an arrow \u201cbig number\u201d (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/ccdbbe3b765d4df9b2b91270a69ad78a086f2d77/js/src/util/bn.ts), so it has a valueOf function which returns 519500 (with the obvious caveat that it\u2019ll overflow if the number is more than 53-bits). I could divide that by 10^scale from c.type to get 519.5. Is there some easier way to do that?\r\n\r\nFiled by bmatcuk@gmail.com",
