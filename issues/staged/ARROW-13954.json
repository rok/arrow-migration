        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13954](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13954). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13952 introduced testing for the various computer kernel signatures.  The current compute kernel type testing passes in all arguments as arrays.  We should extend it to account for cases where an argument is allowed to be a scalar.",

You are correct, this is not about testing python's type support but actually testing the C++ compute kernels via python.  I have attempted to clarify."
