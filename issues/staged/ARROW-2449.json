        "title": "[Python] Efficiently serialize functions containing NumPy arrays ",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2449](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2449). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt is my understanding that pyarrow falls back to serializing functions (and other complex Python objects) using cloudpickle, which means that the contents of those functions are also serialized using the fallback method, rather than the efficient method described in <https://ray-project.github.io/2017/10/15/fast-python-serialization-with-ray-and-arrow.html.>\u00a0It would be good to get the benefit of fast zero-copy (de)serialization for objects like NumPy arrays contained inside functions.\r\n```java\n\r\nIn [1]: import numpy as np, pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\nIn [2]: pa.__version__\r\nOut[2]: '0.9.0'\r\n\r\nIn [3]: arr = np.random.rand(10000)\r\n\r\nIn [4]: %timeit pa.deserialize(pa.serialize(arr).to_buffer())\r\nThe slowest run took 38.29 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.\r\n10000 loops, best of 3: 68.7 \u00b5s per loop\r\n\r\nIn [5]: def arr_f(): return arr\r\n\r\nIn [6]: %timeit pa.deserialize(pa.serialize(arr_f).to_buffer())\r\nThe slowest run took 5.89 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.\r\n1000 loops, best of 3: 539 \u00b5s per loop\r\n```\r\nFor comparison:\r\n```java\n\r\nIn [7]: %timeit cloudpickle.loads(cloudpickle.dumps(arr))\r\n1000 loops, best of 3: 193 \u00b5s per loop\r\n\r\nIn [8]: %timeit cloudpickle.loads(cloudpickle.dumps(arr_f))\r\nThe slowest run took 4.02 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.\r\n1000 loops, best of 3: 429 \u00b5s per loop\r\n```\r\ncc\u00a0 `[~pcmoritz]`",
