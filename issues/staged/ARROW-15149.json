        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15149](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15149). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis might not be necessary in the long run, but we've had a few days of RSPM being intermittently accessible[1]. We could add a check [when we construct the RSPM url](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/etc/rprofile) that checks the URL we're using for http response and then sets the url to NULL if it errors. Something like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n# Check the url from RSPM first\r\n  .ensure_rspm_works <- function(url) {\r\n    if (is.null(url)) {\r\n      return(NULL)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n# check for curl, if it doens't exist, return the URL anyway\r\n    if (system(\"command -v curl\") == 0) {\r\n# curl to get the http response\r\n      code <- tryCatch({\r\n      system(\r\n        paste0(\r\n          'curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\" ',\r\n          paste0(url, \"/cran/latest/src/contrib/PACKAGES\")\r\n        ),\r\n        intern = TRUE\r\n      )\r\n# if this errors, assume the URL works and the error was in curl\r\n      }, error = function(e) \"200\")\r\n\r\n# if the response code is in the error range, then return null.\r\n      if (as.numeric(code) >= 400) {\r\n        return(NULL)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    url\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then wrap `.pick_cran()` with this function at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/6e20c6b9d7131af41f2e979529d06e507c731373/ci/etc/rprofile#L46\r\n\r\n[1] Here's one PR where that happened for a few days: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11965\r\n",
