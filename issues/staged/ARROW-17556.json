Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a projection expression is unbound then we should bind it to the (augmented) dataset schema and carry on.  Instead it appears we are interpreting \"unbound expression\" as \"nothing set at all\" and loading all fields.",
