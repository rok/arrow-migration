Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm developing a new project based on plasma store with CUDA capability. But I found it is unfriendly for user to compile arrow with cuda capability and install it on their systems. Therefore I'm wondering whether dev team will consider release C++ library with CUDA capability. Or how can I make my own distribution using tools like pip?",

Otherwise, in contrast things like Tensorflow, we only use a limited set of CUDA features, so we can compile for the oldest supported CUDA version and it will work on all newer.\r\n\r\nI'm still +1 on dropping Plasma from the Arrow source tree, we get a lot of bug reports but zero maintenance. Having it in tree leads to false expectations."

However, if you decided to deprecate plasma, It would be nice if you move it to a new repo with proper build guide linking with arrow (only C++ should be fine). Thanks"

Currently I think there is only the willingness to delete code, not for any further work :("
