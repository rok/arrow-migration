Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe core of the algorithm (as python) is\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nfor i, elem in array:\r\n  output[i] = (elem in memo_table)\r\n```\r\n\u00a0Often the right operand list will be very small, in this case, the hashtable should be replaced with a constant vector.\u00a0",
