        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16915](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16915). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInternally, Acero uses ExecBatch everywhere, without schemas.  Originally, the various exit nodes would simply attach a boring schema based on the output data types and an inference of field names.\r\n\r\nHowever, as part of Substrait integration and other improvements the various sink nodes are being amended to support:\r\n\r\n \\* Custom field names\r\n \\* Custom metadata\r\n\r\nHowever, the current implementation is somewhat inconsistent.\r\n\r\nSinkNode:\r\n - Does not support custom field names or metadata\r\nConsumingSinkNode:\r\n - Supports custom names but not custom metadata\r\nWriteNode\r\n - Supports custom metadata but not custom names\r\n\r\nWe should create a `SinkNodeOptions` base class that supports custom names and custom metadata and we should have a single place with utility methods for attaching a schema to an outgoing exec batch.  Then all of our sink nodes should use this single tool for modifying outgoing batches.",
