Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`sort_indices` supports sorting by timestamp arrays, but `array_sort_indices` does not. Here's some example R code to demonstrate this (but this example code depends on ARROW-11703 to run):\r\n```java\n\r\ntbl <- tibble::tibble(\r\n  dttm = lubridate::ymd_hms(c(\"2021-01-01 00:00:00\", \"1900-01-01 00:00:00\")),\r\n)\r\nrb <- arrow::record_batch(tbl)\r\n\r\n# this fails:\r\narrow:::call_function(\r\n  \"array_sort_indices\",\r\n  rb$dttm,\r\n  options = list(order = F)\r\n)\r\n## Error: NotImplemented: Function array_sort_indices has no kernel matching input types (array[timestamp[us, tz=UTC]])\r\n\r\n# this fails because it internally calls array_sort_indices\r\narrow:::call_function(\r\n  \"sort_indices\",\r\n  rb,\r\n  options = list(names = \"dttm\", orders = 0L)\r\n)\r\n## Error: NotImplemented: Function array_sort_indices has no kernel matching input types (array[timestamp[us, tz=UTC]])\r\n\r\n# this succeeds\r\narrow:::call_function(\r\n  \"sort_indices\",\r\n  rb,\r\n  options = list(names = c(\"dttm\", \"dttm\"), orders = 0L)\r\n) \r\n## Array\r\n## <uint64>\r\n## [\r\n##   1,\r\n##   0\r\n## ]\n```",
