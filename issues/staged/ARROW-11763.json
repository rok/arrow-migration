Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn saving a pyarrow Dictionary-type column to parquet, any non-int32 index gets coerced to an int32 index without warning:\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nfrom pyarrow import parquet as pq\r\n\r\nschema = pa.schema({\r\n    'foo': pa.dictionary(pa.int8(), pa.string(), ordered=False),\r\n})\r\n\r\ndef make_trivial_dict_array(dict_type, value, size):\r\n    return \r\n\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pydict({\r\n    'foo': pa.DictionaryArray.from_arrays(\r\n        pa.nulls(1, schema.field('foo').type.index_type).fill_null(0),\r\n        ['bar'])\r\n})\r\n\r\npq.write_table(table, 'test_dict_int8.parquet', version='2.0', data_page_version='2.0')\r\n\r\nprint(f\"dict index type before saving to parquet: {table.schema.field('foo').type.index_type}\")\r\n\r\ndel table\r\n\r\ntable = pq.read_table('test_dict_int8.parquet')\r\nprint(f\"dict index type after saving to parquet: {table.schema.field('foo').type.index_type}\")\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```java\n\r\ndict index type before saving to parquet: int8\r\ndict index type after saving to parquet: int32\r\n```\r\nWhile this is surprising for smaller index types, coercing an int64 index to an int32 index without warning the user seems like asking for trouble.",

I am afraid the C++ code of arrow is far beyond my skills. I looked at it a while back and found it positively daunting to even navigate the code."
