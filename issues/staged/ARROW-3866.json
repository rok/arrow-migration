        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3866). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello everyone,\r\n\r\ntransferring this from Github for Pyarrow. While working with pyarrow I noticed that field metadata does not get carried foreward when creating a table out of several columns. Is this intended behaviour or is there a way to add column metadata later on? The last command in my example does not return anything.\r\n I also could not verify whether this data would be written to parquet later on, because I could not find a way to add field metadata directly to a table.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> import pyarrow.parquet as pq \r\n>>> arr1 = pa.array([1,2]) \r\n>>> arr2 = pa.array([3,4]) \r\n\r\n>>> field1 = pa.field('field1', pa.int64()) \r\n>>> field2 = pa.field('field2', pa.int64()) \r\n\r\n>>> field1 = field1.add_metadata({'foo1': 'bar1'}) \r\n>>> field2 = field2.add_metadata({'foo2': 'bar2'}) \r\n\r\n>>> field1.metadata\r\n{b'foo1': b'bar1'} \r\n>>> field2.metadata\r\n{b'foo2': b'bar2'} \r\n\r\n>>> col1 = pa.column(field1, arr1) \r\n>>> col2 = pa.column(field2, arr2) \r\n>>> col1.field.metadata\r\n{b'foo1': b'bar1'} \r\n\r\n>>> tab = pa.Table.from_arrays([col1, col2]) \r\n>>> tab\r\npyarrow.Table field1: int64 field2: int64 \r\n>>> tab.column(0).field.metadata\r\n```",
