Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, Arrow Substrait does not support a plan with custom output field names. The proposal is to add support for flat (i.e. without nested fields) schemata only at this time.",

            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15901?focusedCommentId=17532284) by Yaron Gvili (rtpsw):*\nTo explain the issue a bit more, the current situation is the following:\r\n1. In Ibis-Substrait protobuf definitions, a plan includes [either a relation or a root-relation](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-substrait/blob/5ca22613b8b9dc5fdc697384c7652675e071f4fc/proto/substrait/plan.proto#L14-L19), while [a root-relation includes a relation and custom output field names](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-substrait/blob/5ca22613b8b9dc5fdc697384c7652675e071f4fc/proto/substrait/algebra.proto#L230-L235).\n1. Arrow-Substrait, which is an Ibis-Substrait plan consumer, [does not support custom output field names defined in a root-relation](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/1dba9fb79eb7800556e387a1cf4851912ce7d724/cpp/src/arrow/engine/substrait/serde.cc#L70-L72).\u00a0\n   \n   Without support for custom output field names, Arrow-Substrait can only process an Ibis-Substrait plan with a (non-root) relation that does not include a specification of output field names. This leads to an output schema (for the plan) with inconvenient field names, and prompts a user to execute a second plan just to apply a field-renaming projection. This is undesirable, of course, and the user would rather have everything done in a single Ibis-Substrait plan. This is fixed by adding support for custom output field names in Arrow-Substrait."
