        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3983](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3983). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGandiva is getting some transitive dependencies to Boost from Arrow. Since we are using the static version of arrow in the packaged gandiva library, it was thought that we would be using the static versions of boost.\r\n\r\nThis holds true in linux where there is no dependency on shared arrow library, but in mac there seems to be a dependency on shared boost libraries even for the static arrow library.\r\n\r\nSo using \"ARROW_BOOST_USE_SHARED\" to force use the boost static libraries while packaging Gandiva in Crossbow.",
