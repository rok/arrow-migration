Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe is_in_meta_binary and index_in_meta_binary functions do not have any \"_doc\" elements.  I had simply ignored them assuming they were some kind of specialized function that shouldn't be exposed for general consumption (see ARROW-13949) but I recently discovered they are legitimate binary variants of their unary counterparts.\r\n\r\nIf we want to continue to expose these functions we should rename them (meta I assume means meta function but the python/r user has no idea what a meta function is) and add _doc elements.",
