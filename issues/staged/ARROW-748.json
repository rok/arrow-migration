Uninstalled 0.1.  Installed 0.2 using\n```Java\nconda install -c conda-forge pyarrow\n```\n\nBut then, when I try ```Java\nimport pyarrow\n```, I get the following error\n```Java\nImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-1-6218b61e718a> in <module>()\n----> 1 import pyarrow as pa\n\n/Users/gnilrets/miniconda3/envs/pyitketl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pyarrow/__init__.py in <module>()\n     26 \n     27 \n---> 28 import pyarrow.config\n     29 from pyarrow.config import cpu_count, set_cpu_count\n     30 \n\nImportError: dlopen(/Users/gnilrets/miniconda3/envs/pyitketl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pyarrow/config.cpython-35m-darwin.so, 2): Symbol not found: __ZN5arrow2io9Writeable5FlushEv\n  Referenced from: /Users/gnilrets/miniconda3/envs/pyitketl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pyarrow/libpyarrow.dylib\n  Expected in: /Users/gnilrets/miniconda3/envs/pyitketl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pyarrow/../../../libarrow_io.dylib\n in /Users/gnilrets/miniconda3/envs/pyitketl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pyarrow/libpyarrow.dylib\n```",

I tried `conda install -c conda-forge arrow-cpp` and it did update the version, but I still got a similar error (different symbol was missing though).  Then I uninstalled pyarrow and arrow-cpp (which also uninstalled parquet-cpp) and reinstalled the 0.2 version.  Now it works!\n\nThanks!"
