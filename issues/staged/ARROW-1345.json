Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe inferred types are the largest ones, and then later conversion fails on any arrays with smaller types because only exact conversions are implemented thus far",
