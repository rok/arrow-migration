        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15118](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15118). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCast kernels seem to always create and populate the null bitmap even if the input data structure had a `nullptr` null bitmap. This automatic and extra allocation is not desirable, and not consistent.\r\n\r\nIt seems some cast kernels use COMPUTED_NO_PREALLOCATE and others use the default (INTERSECTION). We could change INTERSECTION to be a general case where if all inputs have no nulls, then a null bitmap should not be emitted.",

Grep for `null_handling` on files with `cast` word in them gave the following output and none seem to be setting null_handling as `INTERSECTION`.\r\n\r\n\r\n> src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_cast_dictionary.cc:  kernel.null_handling = NullHandling::COMPUTED_NO_PREALLOCATE;\n> src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_cast_internal.cc:  kernel.null_handling = NullHandling::COMPUTED_NO_PREALLOCATE;\n> src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_cast_internal.cc:  kernel.null_handling = NullHandling::COMPUTED_NO_PREALLOCATE;\n> src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_cast_nested.cc:  kernel.null_handling = NullHandling::COMPUTED_NO_PREALLOCATE;\n> src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_cast_nested.cc:  kernel.null_handling = NullHandling::COMPUTED_NO_PREALLOCATE;\r\n\r\nPerhaps, it is being set somewhere but I haven't been able to place it yet."
