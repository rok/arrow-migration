Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor some APIs, it has been a long time since they were annotated deprecated. During this time, a number of releases have been published. So it is time to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that some APIs representing unsupported operations should not be annotated deprecated, unless the overriden APIs are deprecated in the super classes/interfaces.
