Where should this property be attached? MemoryManager/Device?\r\n\r\nWhen this is available, it should probably be used to update `parquet::DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE` and `arrow::datasets::ParquetFileFormat`",

Copying memory is so cheap that other costs (such as system calls, bookkeeping...) might dominate."
