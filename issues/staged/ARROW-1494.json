Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI ran into an issue where a now-temporary column was being deferenced, causing a segfault. In older versions of Arrow, the RecordBatch internally retains boxed arrays. We might separately consider returning to this internal data model even though it results in worse IPC performance in some cases. ",
