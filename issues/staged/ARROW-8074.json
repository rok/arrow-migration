        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8074](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8074). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current `pyarrow.parquet.read_table`/`ParquetFile` can work with buffer (reader) objects (file-like objects, pyarrow.Buffer, pyarrow.BufferReader) as input when dealing with single files. This functionality is for example being used by pandas and kartothek (in addition to being extensively used in our own tests as well).\r\n\r\nWhile we could keep the old implementation to handle single files (which is different from the ParquetDataset logic), there are also some advantages of being able to handle this in the Datasets API.  \r\nFor example, this would enable to filtering functionality of the datasets API, also for this single-file buffers use case, which would be a nice enhancement (currently, `read_table` does not support `filters` in case of single files, which is eg why kartothek implements this themselves).\r\n\r\nWould this be possible to support?\r\n\r\nThe `arrow::dataset::FileSource` already has PATH and BUFFER enum types (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/08f8bff05af37921ff1e5a2b630ce1e7ec1c0ede/cpp/src/arrow/dataset/file_base.h#L46-L49), so it seems in principle possible to create a FileSource (for a FileSystemDataset / FileFragment) from a buffer instead of from a path?",
