        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12940](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12940). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimilar to pyarrow's export_to_c and import_from_c methods. We have c++ wrappers like ImportRecordBatch but they aren't exported from the package namespace, so attaching them to the R6 objects would provide a way to do that. \r\n\r\nLifecycle management of the C pointers they read/write to (allocate/delete) is left outside of these methods (as it is in the non-exported wrappers today).\r\n\r\nexport_to_c should be a method on an object. import_from_c should be a \"class method\" like `$create()`.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, we should inform duckdb of this so that they can remove their `getFromNamespace()` workaround.",
