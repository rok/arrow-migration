        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7035](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7035). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThank you so much for adding support for reading and writing parquet files in R! I have a few questions about the user interface and optional arguments, but I want to highlight how great it is to have this useful filetype to pass data back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe defaults for the optional arguments in `arrow::write_parquet` aren't always clear. Here were my questions after reading the help docs from `write_parquet`:\r\n \\* What's the default `version`? Should a user prefer \"2.0\" for new projects?\r\n \\* What are acceptable values for `compression`? (Answer: `uncompressed`, `snappy`, `gzip`, `brotli`, `zstd`, or `lz4`.)\r\n \\* What's the default for `use_dictionary`? Seems to be `TRUE`, at least some of the time.\r\n \\* What's the default for `write_statistics`? Should a user prefer `TRUE`?\r\n \\* Can I assume `allow_truncated_timestamps` is `FALSE` by default?\r\n\r\nAs someone who works in both R and Python, I was a little surprised when pyarrow uses snappy compression by default, but R's default is uncompressed. My preference would be having the same default arguments, but that might be a fringe use-case.\r\n\r\nWhile I was digging into this, I was surprised that `ParquetReaderProperties` is exported and documented, but `ParquetWriterProperties` isn't. Is that intentional?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

I had similar questions in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5451 where this feature was added. Would you be interested in submitting a pull request to improve the documentation? \r\n\r\nSome specific answers:\r\n\r\n- The R bindings defer the default behavior to C++. You can find the defaults there at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/properties.h#L87-L98 and https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/properties.h#L586-L590. The Python docstring may also be useful: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L347-L385\n- Acceptable values for compression are https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/R/enums.R#L79, but all of them may not be available: it also depends on what your C++ library was built with. In the dev version of the package, you can query that with `codec_is_available(codec)`.\n- I don't have an opinion about whether pyarrow and the R package should have the same defaults here, particularly if they differ from what the C++ defaults are. I could see both sides of the argument for changing the default compression to snappy (though if you did, you'd have to check if snappy were available, and otherwise fall back to uncompressed). FWIW the pyarrow parquet writer also has other features (like `flavor = \"spark\"`) that aren't (yet) in the R implementation.\n- ParquetWriterProperties and ParquetArrowWriterProperties should be documented and exported, probably in the same file.
