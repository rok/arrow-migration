Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis will serve as a sink ExecNode which dumps all the batches it receives to disk. The PR should probably also replace `FileSystemDataset::Write` with an ExecPlan based implementation",

I think PartitionNode would:\r\n- use a Grouper for id-ing their destination partition\n- sort batches by their partition id\n- emit slices of input batches with equal partition id\n    - the partition expression is stored in ExecBatch::guarantee\n  (note: does not utilize a dataset::Partitioning)\n  \n  Then WriteNode would only use a Partitioning to format ExecBatch::guarantees to an output directory. I think this approach would allow us to delete Partitioning::Partition too, since that behavior would now be encapsulated by PartitionNode.\n  \n  Also note that whatever approach you take is going to impinge on ARROW-13338 since ExecPlans don't support sync scanning and FileSystemDataset::Write depends on [[deprecated]] Scanner::Scan"
