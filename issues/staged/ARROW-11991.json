Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently it returns Partitioning::UnknownPartitioning(num_partitions) based on the sum of partition counts (if available) of the underlying inputs. In case of another partition scheme - such as hash partitioning, it would be better to keep that information available, so other optimizations could be used.",
