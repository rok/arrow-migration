Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe invocation would look something like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  std::shared_ptr<Table> out_table;\r\n  ARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK(arrow::compute::MakeExecNode(\r\n      \"table_sink\", plan, {terminal_node}, arrow::compute::TableSinkOptions{&out_table}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the plan is finished (assuming a successful finish) then `out_table` will be the output of the plan collected into a table.  The schema of the table will be `terminal_node->output_schema()`",

Since we want to provide the output from the exec system to an outside system or resume outside the exec-plan, this could be sufficient.\u00a0\r\n\r\n`[~westonpace]` any thoughts?\u00a0"

At some point we are going to have to figure out how to support those operations mid-plan and so I think we can come up with a more general solution at that time."
