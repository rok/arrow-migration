        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16728](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16728). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe ParquetDataset() constructor itself still defaults to `use_legacy_dataset=True` (although using specific attributes or keywords related to that will raise a warning). So a next step will be to actually deprecate passing that and switching the default, and then only afterwards we can remove the code.",
