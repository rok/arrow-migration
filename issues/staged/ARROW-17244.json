        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17244](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17244). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe \"Website\" component is used to identify [issues requiring changes to the Arrow website](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20component%20%3D%20Website). These changes are made independent of Arrow releases, rendering the fixVersion field pointless. Existing tools and procedures continue to populate this field, though, and resulting in website-only changes being included in version-specific release notes months later. By way of example, the [8.0.0 release notes](https://arrow.apache.org/release/8.0.0.html) include:\r\n \\* ARROW-14776\u00a0- [Website] Don\u2019t include squashed commits in merge commit message\r\n \\* ARROW-15472\u00a0- [Website] Add Flight SQL blog post\r\n \\* ARROW-15491\u00a0- [Website] Rotate PMC chair for 2022\r\n \\* ARROW-15902\u00a0- [Website] Add new committers: Raphael Taylor-Davies, Wang Xudong, Yijie Shen, Kun Liu\r\n \\* ARROW-15931\u00a0- [Website] Add explicit Apache LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files to apache/arrow-site repository\r\n \\* ARROW-15683\u00a0- [Website][Rust][DataFusion] Make a 7.0.0 release announcement blog\r\n \\* ARROW-16411\u00a0- [Website] Migrate to Matomo from Google Analitics\r\n\r\nThe fixVersion should not be populated with an Arrow release version for website-only changes. It could be left blank, or a website-only version value could be created.",
