Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`scalar_temporal.cc` takes a lot of time to compile, even in debug mode. This may be due to the large combination of compute functions and input types. It would be nice to try to make compile times smaller.",
