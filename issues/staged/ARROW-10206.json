Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNote that this requires using grpc-cpp version 1.25 or higher.\r\n\r\nThis requires using GRPC's TlsCredentials class, which is in a different namespace for 1.25-1.31 vs. 1.32+ as well.\r\n\r\nThis class and its related options provide an option to disable server certificate checks and require the caller to supply a callback to be used instead.",

Prior to 1.27, the features in gRPC needed to support this don't exist. The option to disable server verification fails at runtime if used.\r\n2. Between 1.27 to 1.31 (inclusive), the features needed are in the grpc_impl::experimental namespace. Compile the code in Flight client using that namespace.\r\n3. From 1.32 and later, the features are in the grpc::experimental namespace. Compile the code in Flight client using that namespace."
