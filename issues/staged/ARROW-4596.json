Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd support for COUNT aggregate function. See SUM function in aggregates.rs for inspiration.\r\n\r\nSQL parser should support COUNT(1) and COUNT ( \\* ) syntax for counting rows as well as COUNT(column_name) for counting non-null values for a column.\r\n\r\nCOUNT(DISTINCT expr) should be handled in a separate issue since it is more complex.",
