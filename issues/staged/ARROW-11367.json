        "title": "[C++] Implement approximante quantile utility",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11367](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11367). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis utility is to approximate quantiles of arbitrary length inputs with constant space (not storing input data points) [1]. It will be used in implementing approximate quantile kernel and calculating latencies in flightrpc benchmark.\r\n\r\nt-digest [2] is state-of-the-art algorithm for quantile approximation. It performs well on both edge (0.01, 0.99, etc)  and normal cases (0.3, 0.5, etc). And t-digest can run in parallel, which means multiple chunks can be processed at same time and combined later.\r\n\r\nT-Digest author maintains an java implementation [3]. There are some open source c++ versions available, including facebook folly [4]. I planned to port one of them but finally came up with my own implementation, which (I suppose) is more efficient in space and time.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] A Survey of Approximate Quantile Computation on Large-scale Data\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08255v1\r\n[2] Computing Extremely Accurate Quantiles Using t-Digests\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04023\r\n[3] https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/\r\n[4] https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/stats/TDigest.h\r\nhttps://github.com/derrickburns/tdigest\r\nhttps://github.com/SpirentOrion/digestible",
