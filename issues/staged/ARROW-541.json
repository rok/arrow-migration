        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-541](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-541). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would really like to see an implementation of Arrow that is compatible with NodeJS and modern web browsers. This would enable streaming columnar data to the browser without an intermediate conversion to JSON \u2013 I could imagine web-based data visualization systems would benefit substantially from this functionality. \n\nBecause Google's Flatbuffers library has first-class JS support, this should be achievable. Carlos Scheidegger created a prototype implementation of the Feather file format (basically: mini-Arrow) last year: https://github.com/wesm/feather/tree/master/js\n\nThis JIRA can be an umbrella issue for the JS implementation. As soon as we find interested contributors to work on this, we can create JIRAs and attach them to this issue until we reach a certain level of maturity.\n\nWithout starting a bike shed discussion, I humbly request that the implementation be done in TypeScript https://www.typescriptlang.org/",

Here's one I worked on last year: https://github.com/danrobinson/jsarrow. It is probably out of date with the spec and certainly the C++ implementation (with which it was fairly tightly coupled), so I'd be fine starting from scratch if you or others have a roadmap in mind, and maybe cannibalizing it for parts (like the C++ bindings).\n\n+1 to TypeScript (another reason I would scrap most of that old repo)."

I worked on a (very basic) library last fall focused on reading arrow files in the browser/node for data visualization. Unfortunately its a private repo and I can't link it here but I've got the go-ahead to cannibalize parts of it for an official implementation.\n\nTypeScript does seem like the way to go for this."

Have worked on a lot of demanding projects using Java + Python (sadly for closed-source investment banks), and my code quality is generally pretty good.   Happy to adopt code styles from high quality Typescript projects and put in some good sweat equity to implement an implementation that the community can be happy with..\n\nI'm esp. interested in getting cool projects like this to work with Arrow (https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable).  [i.e. Super cool but begging for higher quality I/O that Arrow would provide.]"
