Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParquet files cannot be opened in Windows Parquet Viewer when stored with Arrow Version 9.0.0. It worked when stored with version 8 and earlier.\r\n\r\nWindows Parquet Viewer: 2.3.5 and 2.3.6\r\n\r\npyarrow version: 9.0.0\r\n\r\nError: System.AggregateException: One or more errors occured. ---> Parquet.ParquetException: encoding RLE_DICTIONARY is not supported.\u00a0\r\n\r\nat Parquet.File.DataColumnReader.ReadColumn(BinaryReader reader ... in DataColumnReader.cs: line 259\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter further checking I found that it seems the problem seems to relate to a default parquet version change.\r\n\r\nWhen I use pyarrow 9 and configure version to 1.0 it works again from the windows tool - when its 2.4 its not working (or supported in the windows tool).\r\n\r\ndf.to_parquet(r'C:\\temp\\test_10.parquet', version='1.0')\r\ndf.to_parquet(r'C:\\temp\\test_24.parquet', version='2.4')\r\n\r\nQuestion might be if such a default change is a bug or a feature.\r\n\r\nFinally found:\u00a0\r\n \\* ARROW-12203\u00a0- [C++][Python] Switch default Parquet version to 2.4 (#13280)\r\n\r\nSo probably its a feature - and we need to adapt our code\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Hopefully Windows Parquet Viewer will add support for the more recent version soon."
