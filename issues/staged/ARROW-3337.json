Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe JS writer only serializes dictionaries for [top-level children](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/ee9b1ba426e2f1f117cde8d8f4ba6fbe3be5674c/js/src/ipc/writer/binary.ts#L40) of a Table. This is wrong, and an oversight on my part. The fix here is to put the actual Dictionary vectors in the `schema.dictionaries` map instead of the dictionary fields, like I understand the C++ does.",
