Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs you can see in [ARROW-10368](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10368), I had quite a hard time figuring out that the TableProvider trait could be used to provide custom source implementations for DataFusion.\r\n\r\nI think that adding a `read_table(provider: Box<dyn TableProvider + Send + Sync>) -> Result<Arc<dyn DataFrame>>` method to the ExecutionContext and an example in the tests and/or in the examples folder would make the API more explicit.",
