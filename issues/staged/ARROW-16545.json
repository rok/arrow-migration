So you don't need to wrap an fsspec HadoopFileSystem again in ArrowFSWrapper. \r\n\r\nThe pyarrow methods like `pq.read_table` do accept fsspec-compatible filesystems (under the hood we will wrap those in a `pyarrow.fs.FSSpecHandler`). So in your test script, you can pass the `hdfs` fsspec filesystem object directly to `pq.read_table` (as you noticed that this works).\r\n\r\nNow, in practice, if you don't need other fsspec functionality, and since the fsspec HadoopFileSystem is wrapping a pyarrow HadoopFileSystem, you could also directly use the pyarrow filesystem instead, in this case."
