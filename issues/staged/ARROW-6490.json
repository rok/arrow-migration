Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the allocator close throws an exception that includes some details in case of memory leaks. However, if there is a hierarchy of allocators and they are all closed at different times, it's hard to find the cause of the original leak.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we also log a message when the leak occurs, it will be easier to correlate these.",
