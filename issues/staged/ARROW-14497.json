Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are a lot of hardcoded urls referencing non-sphinx documentations across the generated HTML files, couple of examples:\r\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/c_glib/\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/java/reference/\n  \n  Using the new versioned docs the `https://arrow.apache.org/docs/5.0/java/index.html` links should point to `https://arrow.apache.org/docs/5.0/java/reference/` instead of `https://arrow.apache.org/docs/java/reference/`\n  \n  cc `[~jorisvandenbossche]`",
