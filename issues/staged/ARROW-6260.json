Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-4473 added CI/CD for the website, but there was some discomfort about having a committer provide a GitHub personal access token to do the pushing of the built site to the asf-site branch. Investigate using GitHub Deploy Keys instead, which are scoped to a single repository, not all public repositories that a user has access to.",
