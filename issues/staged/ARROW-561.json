        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-561). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current build for arrow uses a interesting work around for hamcrest conflict between JUNIT and mockito which results in mockito being in the compile scope. This is not suitable for some downstream users.\n\nPython setup file also leaves out test dependency (not overly important but useful for developers) & we can clarify parquet-cpp as an \"extra\" dependency for people requiring parquet support (already mentioned in the README file but good to have clarity in setup.py as well).",
