(hash_distinct, hash_count, hash_sum)\r\nYes I think we should aim for that (or nearly that; there might be a few exceptions where it does not make sense.) Comparing the lists of aggregation functions and hash (grouped) aggregation functions in [compute.rst](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/cpp/compute.rst), they are mostly the same already, with just a few differences. I think this issue and ARROW-13309 are the most important two additions to bring these two lists closer to parity."
