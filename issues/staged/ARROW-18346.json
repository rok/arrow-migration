Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- Writer options are not very discoverable. Perhaps \"file_options\" should mention compression as an example of something you can control, so people looking for it know where to go next?\n   \\* Compression seems like it might be common enough to warrant a top-level parameter somehow (even if it gets implemented differently internally)?\n   \\* Either way, this needs a cookbook example.\n   \\* `make_write_options` is lacking a docstring\n   \\* Writer options objects are lacking `{}__repr__{`}s",
