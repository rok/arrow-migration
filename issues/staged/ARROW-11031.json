        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11031](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11031). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have started updating tasks in Jira that were missing assignees.\r\n\r\nI see that [~nevi_me]\u00a0 `[~alamb]` `[~jorgecarleitao]` have asked about how to do this in the past so I will briefly explain here.\r\n\r\nFirst you need admin permissions to Jira (I will grant these to you now).\r\n\r\nNext you need to add new contributors to the \"contributors\" role in JIRA. To do this, go to the project setting for Apache Arrow. Select \"users and roles\" on the left. Click \"add user to role\" in top right. Then enter the user name and choose the \"contributor\" role.\r\n\r\nAfter that you can assign issues to that user (and they can self-assign too)",
