Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe example in the documentation states:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n// This example shows how one can slice an array.\r\n// The initial (float64) array is:\r\n// [1, 2, 3, (null), 4, 5]\r\n//\r\n// and the sub-slice is:\r\n// [3, (null), 4]\r\n```\r\nHowever, the initial array is actually `[1, 2, 3, -1, 4, 5]` and the sub-slice is actually `[3, -1, 4]`.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
