Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGenerate object identifiers for Projector and Filter, so that we can test the external layer to C++ if the identifier is the same to ensure that caching is not broken.\r\n\r\nIntroduce JNI api to query for the same.\r\n\r\nHowever this is not of high priority since we have tests in the core gandiva layer for the same.\r\n\r\nCurrent tests depend on time but it is causing spurious failures.",
