Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe'd like to open a file (using HadoopFileSystem) and then read a block of data specified by the offset and the length. We don't want any read ahead to happen.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe libhdfs driver supprots hdfsPread, and it exposes a ReadAt method in the RandomAccessFile interface. However, there is no way to access it from python.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe add a read_at method to pyarrow.NativeFile that would expose this functionality.\u00a0",
