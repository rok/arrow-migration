This returns an empty pandas dataframe.",

I was able to reproduce the issue with the 5.0.2 release.  I could not reproduce the issue with the candidate 6.0.0 code.  The segmentation fault originates from Converted_DIctionary and I'm fairly certain this is a duplicate of ARROW-14321 which has been resolved.  6.0.0 will be releasing soon but you can try out a nightly build if you want to test this earlier."
