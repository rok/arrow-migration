Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `Resize` and `Reserve` methods only reserve space for the value offsets. When building binary/string arrays with a known size (or some reasonable estimate), it would be more efficient to reserve once at the beginning to prevent internal reallocations",
