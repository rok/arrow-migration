        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18001). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis question came up in the GitHub issue: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14025> .\r\n###### Description:\r\n\r\nIf a user wants to change a type of one single column when using `to_parquet` in pandas (or dask) they currently need to specify the schema with all columns included. If a column is not specified in the schema, it will not be included in the parquet file.\r\n\r\nThe type inference happens when converting a python object (eg pandas dataframe, or a dict, ..) to an Arrow Table, and once you have such table with a fixed schema, writing to Parquet doesn't do type inference anymore (since arrow types map to parquet types).\r\n###### Proposal\r\n\r\nThere should be a possibility to provide a way to specify the type of a subset of columns for `{}from_pandas{`}.",
