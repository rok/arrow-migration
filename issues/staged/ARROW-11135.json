Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm working on connecting Arrow/Gandiva with Apache Calcite. Overall the integration is working well, but I'm having issues. As [suggested on the mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r93a4fedb499c746917ab8d62cf5a8db8c93a7f24bc9fac81f90bedaa%40%3Cuser.arrow.apache.org%3E), using Dremio's public artifacts solves the problem. Between two Apache projects however, there would be a strong preference to use Apache artifacts as a dependency.",

I am working on the same branch as `[~mmior]` (see CALCITE-2040).

But I noticed that Apache Arrow Gandiva 3.0.0 was released on 2021/01/25 and the artifacts are on [Maven central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.arrow.gandiva/arrow-gandiva/3.0.0/jar), so I have been trying to switch to that version and run on macOS.\r\n\r\nSome background: In order to merge CALCITE-2040 to Calcite's master branch as a beta feature, we must use artifacts from Maven central, rather than from Dremio's maven repo, or Usra labs' snapshots, or a .jar committed to Calcite's git repo; I don't mind as much whether the artifacts are for Linux or macOS.\r\n\r\nI am running into errors which I think mean I need to install protobuf2.5 on my Mac.

I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nIn case I didn't make it clear: We have used the ursa-labs nightly build, and in fact we checked one of the jars into a git branch during development. But in order to merge into Calcite's master branch (from which releases will be made), we can only depend on released artifacts in Maven central.  Our criteria are:\r\n- master branch MUST NOT contain binary files (e.g. .jar);\n- a source release MUST NOT contain binary files;\n- master branch and release builds MUST NOT depend on snapshot or nightly artifacts, only released artifacts;\n- code SHOULD run on at least Linux and macOS (windows would be nice, but it's not feasible);\n- all platforms SHOULD use the same jar file;\n- artifacts SHOULD be in maven central (another repo might be possible). \n  \n  These are fairly typical for an ASF project, I think. They are designed to reduce friction for people who want to use or develop this feature."
