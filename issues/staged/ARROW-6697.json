Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen reading a partitioned Parquet file in DataFusion, the schema is read from the first partition and it is assumed that all other partitions have the same schema.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to actually validate that all of the partitions have the same schema since there is no support for schema merging yet.",
