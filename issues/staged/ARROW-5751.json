        "title": "[Packaging][Python] Python macOS wheels have dynamic dependency on libcares",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5751](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5751). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm afraid while\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4685>\u00a0fixed the macOS wheels for python 3, but the python 2.7 wheel is still broken (with a different error):\r\n```java\n\r\nImportError: dlopen(/Users/pcmoritz/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/lib.cpython-36m-darwin.so, 2): Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/c-ares/lib/libcares.2.dylib\r\n\r\n\u00a0 Referenced from: /Users/pcmoritz/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/libarrow_python.14.dylib\r\n\r\n\u00a0 Reason: image not found\n```\r\nI tried the same hack as in\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4685>\u00a0for libcares\u00a0but it doesn't work (removing the .dylib fails one of the earlier build steps). I think the only way to go forward on this is to compile grpc ourselves. My attempt to do this in\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/compare/master...pcmoritz:mac-wheels-py2>\u00a0fails because\u00a0OpenSSL is not found even though I'm specifying the\u00a0OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR (see\u00a0<https://travis-ci.org/pcmoritz/crossbow/builds/550603543>). Let me know if you have any ideas how to fix this!",
