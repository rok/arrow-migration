Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo create new arrays from existing buffers in Python, we would need to call into the C++ `MakeArray` method. This would\u00a0then construct the Array and we would only wrap it in Python to have construction support for all Array types.\r\n\r\nThis would also mean that we need to have a Python representation of `ArrayData`",

We could simply make it implicit in our factory method, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\ncdef class Array:\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def from_buffers(cls, type, length, buffers, null_count=-1, offset=0):\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n"
