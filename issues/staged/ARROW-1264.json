Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment if the Python PlasmaClient cannot connect to the store after a certain number of retries, the Python interpreter is terminated with ARROW_LOG(FATAL), see:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/plasma/io.cc#L167\n\nInstead we should raise an exception in Python.\n\nThis has for example caused problems in pytest, because pytest surpresses output and displays it at the end of the test run; if the interpreter is killed in the above manner, the output is never shown.",
