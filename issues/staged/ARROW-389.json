Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `pyarrow.parquet.write_table`\u00a0only supports strings as filename arguments and thus can only store files locally. The implementation should match the behaviour of `pyarrow.parquet.read_table`.",
