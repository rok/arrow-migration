Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are a number of optional components in the Arrow C++ library. In Python we have feature flags to turn on and off parts of the bindings based on what C++ libraries have been built. There is also some logic to try to detect what has been built and enable those features.\r\n\r\nWe need to have the same thing in R. Some components, like Plasma, are not available for Windows and so necessarily these will have to be flagged off. ",
