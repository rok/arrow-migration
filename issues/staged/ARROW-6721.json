Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current `AvroAdapterBenchmark`\u00a0actually only run once during JMH evaluation, since the decoder was consumed for the first time and the follow-up invokes will directly return.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we use `BinaryDecoder`\u00a0explicitly in benchmark and reset its inner stream first when the test method is invoked.",
