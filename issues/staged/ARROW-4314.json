        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4314](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4314). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee the proposal I made on\u00a0 `[~csun]`'s repository [here](https://github.com/sunchao/parquet-rs/issues/205) for more details.\r\n\r\nThis aims to let the user opt in to strong typing and substantial performance improvements (2x-7x, see [here](https://github.com/sunchao/parquet-rs/issues/205#issuecomment-446016254)) by optionally specifying the type of the records that they are iterating over.\r\n\r\nIt is currently a work in progress. All pre-existing tests succeed, bar those in src/record/api.rs which are commented out as they require reworking. Where relevant, pre-existing tests and benchmarks have been duplicated to make new strongly-typed tests and benchmarks, which all also succeed. I've tried to maintain pre-existing APIs where possible. Some changes have been made to better align with prior art in the Rust ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAny feedback while I continue working on it very welcome! Looking forward to hopefully seeing this merged when it's ready.",
