        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6884](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6884). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHere is what an error looks like when a client RPC fails in the server\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nE   pyarrow.lib.ArrowException: Unknown error: gRPC returned unknown error, with message: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'\r\nE   In ../src/arrow/python/flight.cc, line 201, code: CheckPyError(). Detail: Python exception: TypeError\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"line 201, code:\" business is added by -DARROW_EXTRA_ERROR_CONTEXT=ON so the normal use won't see this\r\n\r\nIt might be nice to re-raise the same exception type in the client with some extra context added to make clear that it is a server-side error",

But we could do more on the server (I think we don't log exceptions or anything, so there is nothing on the server side to tell you what happened by default)."
