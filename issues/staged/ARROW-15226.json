Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter consolidating ChunkedArray constructors in ARROW-15194, the [Cython binding for the single parameter constructor](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/includes/libarrow.pxd#L728) was not removed. Also, need to set default value for the long-form constructor.",

We need to provide declarations for each overloaded version, which is how it is right now, so no change is required."
