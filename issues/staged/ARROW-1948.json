Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt is valid for ipc to send a validity buffer with no values set that indicate all values are non-null.  This is already handled by all vectors except ListVector, which will throw an invalid index exception when this is the case because it does not build the validity buffer with all elements set. ",
