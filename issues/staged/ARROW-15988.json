Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a follow up to [ARROW-15694](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15694).\r\n\r\nOnce Apache Infra switches the default Git branch from master to main in apache/arrow-site, we should completely remove support for triggering the deploy.yml CI workflow on a push to master.\r\n\r\nThis should be straightforward and would involve removing master from the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` push trigger condition.",
