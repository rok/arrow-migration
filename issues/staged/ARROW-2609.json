Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe converter `pyarrow.Field.from_jvm` currently only works for primitive types. Types like List, Struct or Union that have children in their definition are not supported. We should add the needed recursion for these types and enable the respective tests.",
