Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUseCase: I was trying to simultaneously read and write an arrow file which in turn gave me an Error. It is leading to file corruption. I am currently using read_feather and write_feather functions to save it as a .arrow file. Do let me know if there's anything in this regard or any other way to avoid this.\u00a0\r\n\r\n[Error: Invalid: Not an Arrow file]",

When you say \"it is leading to file corruption\", do you mean that when you try to read from a file which has not been fully written yet, then if you try to read if after it has been fully written, it is corrupted? Or something else?"
