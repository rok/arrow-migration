Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`read_parquet` currently handles a path to a local file or an Arrow input stream.\u00a0 Would it be possible to add support for a raw vector containing the contents of a parquet file?\r\n\r\nApologies if there is already a way to do this.\u00a0 I have tried populating a buffer and passing that as input, but\u00a0that is unsupported as well.\u00a0 An example of how to work using an input stream would be useful as well.",

Out of curiosity, why are you trying to do this? Why do you have a Parquet file in memory as a raw vector? I'm wondering if there's a better solution to your actual problem than extending `read_parquet` to read raw vectors."

You may also consider syncing the files from HDFS to your local file system and passing the file path to `read_parquet`; if the files are large that will be much more efficient with memory."
