Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeveral aliases were introduced in v7 to ease conversion from v6 -> v7 with some of the renaming that had been done such as `array.Interface` becoming `arrow.Array`.
