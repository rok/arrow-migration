Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow spec allows makes the null bitmap optional if an array has no nulls `[~carols10cents]`, so the tests that were failing were because we're comparing `None` with a 100% populated bitmap.",
