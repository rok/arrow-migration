        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11117](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11117). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow C++ ORC reader does not process types correctly. In particular it does the following:\r\n1. It converts the ORC STRING type to the Arrow STRING type despite the fact that all ORC STRINGs are large.\r\n\r\n2. It converts the ORC LIST type to the Arrow LIST type despite the fact that all ORC LISTs are large.\r\n\r\n3. It converts the ORC MAP type to LISTS of STRUCTS with hardcoded field names while an actual MAP type exists in Arrow (note that the ORC MAPs are large so we need to filter out large ones when converting).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese issues need to be fixed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
