Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/121 for ARROW-262, the `Struct` name is reserved in Flatbuffers, so we temporarily used the ``Tuple`` name. We should either use a tweaked name like `Struct_` that does not cause conflicts or choose a name for the Struct concept (e.g. `Tuple`) and use that consistently in format documents and implementation.\n\nThe least disruptive solution is to use the `Struct_` name in the Flatbuffers IDL.",
