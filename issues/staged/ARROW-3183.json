Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPython Version: Anaconda 3.6\r\n PyArrow Version: 0.9.0 and 0.10.0\r\n Installed by: conda\r\n\r\n`The function pa.get_library_dirs() points to the wrong directory`\r\n\r\n`import pyarrow as pa`\r\n `print(pa.get_library_dirs())`\r\n\r\nreturns (Notice the extra lib in the middle of the 2nd string):\u00a0\r\n\r\n`['C:\\\\Anaconda\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\pyarrow', 'C:\\\\Anaconda\\\\lib\\\\Library\\\\lib']`\r\n\r\nbut it should be:\r\n\r\n`['C:\\\\Anaconda\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\pyarrow', 'C:\\\\Anaconda\\\\Library\\\\lib']`\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is dependent on how `pyarrow` was installed on the system.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

But wanted to verify that my logic wasn't flawed. I thought other projects(Turbodbc) were already using this function, so I wanted to verify I wasn't doing something wrong.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n@wesm to answer your question on the [`TODO`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/e0c07f4dfe4305aadfd7288403f6f3c6272a8369/python/pyarrow/__init__.py#L222-L223).\r\n\r\nI don't use `conda` to build my local Cpp extensions, so that section of code is useful for the cases in which the user uses `setuptools` directly to build."
