Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPOC to move Arrow Java module to Single/Multi module mode.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are supporting Arrow Java JSE1.8 to be able to consume by JSE11,17,18 in **legacy mode** that is enabled when the compilation environment is defined by the `{}--source{`},\u00a0`--target.`\r\n\r\nThis POC is to validate changes needed in case Arrow java decided to implement \"{**}Single module mode{**}\" or \"{**}Multi-module mode{**}\"",

For instance Flight should probably be in a separate module, anything using JNI should be in a separate module, and possibly adapters like arrow-avro and arrow-jdbc should be in their own modules?"

Currently Arrow Java are configured as a multi module that help us a lot at compile time, then is needed to analyze how do we could take advantage about Java Modular for Arrow Java at runtime."
