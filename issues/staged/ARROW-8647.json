Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the Python ParquetDataset implementation, the partition fields are returned as dictionary type columns. \r\n\r\nIn the new Dataset API, we now use a plain type (integer or string when inferred). But, you can already manually specify that the partition keys should be dictionary type by specifying the partitioning schema (in `Partitioning` passed to the dataset factory). \r\n\r\nSince using dictionary type can be more efficient (since partition keys will typically be repeated values in the resulting table), it might be good to still have an option in the DatasetFactory to use dictionary types for the partition fields.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6303#discussion_r400622340",
