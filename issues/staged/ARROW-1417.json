Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `ParquetDataset` currently only supports filesystems derived from the `pyarrow.filesystem.FileSystem` and the `S3FileSystem`, see [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L646)\n\nA more generic filesystem acceptance would be useful to enable external code to use the `ParquetDataset` directly",
