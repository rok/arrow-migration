Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would expect `rng.Boolean(length, 0.99)` to generate an array that is 99% \"true\" on average. \r\n\r\nThe docs say \"/// \\param[in] probability the estimated number of active bits\", but this is not what the function does (the opposite, actually).
