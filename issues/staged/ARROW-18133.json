        "title": "[C++] Update \"options\" handling for Substrait functions",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18133](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18133). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-17966 will adjust to the new style of options.  However, many of our existing mappings are treating options incorrectly, largely because the Substrait function definitions changed after the mappings were added.  For example, the arithmetic functions are always looking for an \"overflow\" option, even though that option is only defined for integral kernels.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, this is mostly harmless.  No producers that I am aware of specify options yet.  When they do, some of these issues will probably still be harmless.  For example, it should not hurt to look for an overflow option when it can never be defined.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should do a pass through and cleanup our handling of options once the Substrait spec has stabilized.",
