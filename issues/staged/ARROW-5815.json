It also would be weird since it is asym in that other vector types may not be able to support the behavior.\u00a0"

It improves code readability, and make the program logic easier to reason about. \r\nIn addition, it helps JIT optimization (I am not sure if this is true?). \r\n\r\nAre there any other reasons?\r\n"
