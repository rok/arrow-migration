        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5034](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5034). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are times when callers are in a synchronous method and need to write an Arrow stream. However, ArrowStreamWriter (and ArrowFileWriter) only\u00a0expose WriteAsync methods, which means the caller needs to\u00a0call the Async method, and then block on the resulting Task.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should also expose Write methods that complete in a synchronous fashion, so the callers are free to choose the sync or async methods as they need.",
