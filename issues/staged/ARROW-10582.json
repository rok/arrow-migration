        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10582](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10582). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe repartition operator should read batches from its input partitions and then map that data to its output partitions using a specific partitioning scheme.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and most efficient partition schema would be a \"round robin batch partitioner\". For each input batch, it would pick the next output partition to write to. This is a convenient way to change the number of partitions up or down with minimal overhead.\r\n\r\nAnother example of a partitioning scheme would be a hash partitioner, which computes the hash of the partition keys on each incoming row and then applies a modulus to determine which output partition to write to.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
