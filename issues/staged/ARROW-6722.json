Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the getName method is defined in BaseValueVector, as an abstract class. However, some vector does not extend the BaseValueVector, like StructVector, UnionVector, ZeroVector.\r\nIn this issue, we move the method to ValueVector interface, the base interface for all vectors.\r\nThis makes it easier to get a vector's name without checking its type.",
