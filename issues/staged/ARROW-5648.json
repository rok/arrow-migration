Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee comment on\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3758\u00a0and [chat discussion](https://ursalabs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/180245-dev/topic/Need.20help.20with.20Windows.20compilation/near/168456857). In the toolchain used to build R packages,\u00a0`codecvt` [isn't found](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nealrichardson/arrow/builds/25367079#L1177). This was apparently made into a harder requirement with the filesystem work last month.\r\n\r\nWe'll need some kind of workaround.\u00a0<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15615136/is-codecvt-not-a-std-header>\u00a0suggests Boost.Locale.",
