Some C++ coding questions:\r\n\r\n- Should all classes that are public exports use the pImpl pattern (both ClientMiddleware and ClientMiddlewareFactories would in this case)?\n- Do we have a ConcurrentMap class? If not, would the preference be to implement a simple implementation of one or just use std::lock and a map?\n- Thinking of using boost spirit for parsing the cookie string. I don't see boost itself being used in the codebase very much though \u2013 are we trying to avoid boost dependencies within the implementation?"
