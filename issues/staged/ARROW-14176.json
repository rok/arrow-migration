        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14176](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14176). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis originates from [this SO question\\|[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69379083/read-a-partitioned-parquet-dataset-from-multiple-files-with-pyarrow-and-add-a-pa].]\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a portioning scheme that would allow to construct a primary key from the filename.\r\n\r\nLet's say that one is trying to read `/data-N.parquet` where `N` is an integer. That information should go in a primary key for later reference.\r\n\r\nThis is quite similar to have the files laid-out like this : `/N/data.parquet` so I imagine this is technically feasible.",
