Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-12861 adds a `sign` kernel to the C++ library. Add a mapping to this in the R package.\r\n\r\nI think this should be as simple as just adding\r\n```java\n\r\n\"sign\" = \"sign\",\n```\r\nto `.unary_function_map` in `expression.R`, plus a simple test.\r\n\r\nNote that the C++ library's `sign` kernel returns integer output whereas base R's `sign`\u00a0function returns numeric (double) output, so a test written with `expect_dplyr_equal()`\u00a0might fail unless it explicitly converts the output from `sign()`\u00a0using\u00a0`as.numeric()` or `as.integer()`.",
