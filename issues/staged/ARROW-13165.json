Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `project` kernel creates a column of struct (equivalent to a column of named lists in R). Add to `make_compute_options` in `compute.cpp` so we can pass `ProjectOptions` to the `project` kernel.\r\n\r\nOne practical application of the `project` kernel is to create a binding for the stringr function `str_locate` which returns a column of named lists.",

Note that there isn't a static `$create()` for other array types...you can create a `StructArray` using `Array$create()` (just like you can for the other array types).\n- After ARROW-13371, you can access `make_struct` by creating a nested data frame in `dplyr::mutate()`, but this doesn't pass through additional options (existing or otherwise)."

But not if you have Arrays. Here's an illustration:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n> a <- Array$create(1:5)\r\n> b <- Array$create(6:10)\r\n\r\n# I can make a RecordBatch fine:\r\n> record_batch(a = a, b = b)\r\nRecordBatch\r\n5 rows x 2 columns\r\n$a <int32>\r\n$b <int32>\r\n\r\n# But how can I make a StructArray?\r\n> Array$create(a = a, b = b)\r\nError in Array$create(a = a, b = b) : unused arguments (a = a, b = b)\r\n```"
