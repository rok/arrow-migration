Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`FileOutputStream` has a constructor option named `append`, but all it does is prevent truncation of the file, i.e. it doesn't move the file pointer to the end. And given `FileOutputStream` doesn't have a seek method, this option is useless unless you manually seek using the file descriptor.",
