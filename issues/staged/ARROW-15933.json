        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15933](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15933). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe datasets API currently allows users to plug in their own file formats.  The Substrait consumer only allows parquet & IPC.  There is an open Substrait issue to make the file format extensible: https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/issues/138\r\n\r\nOnce that feature is added we will need some kind of extension point in our Substrait consumer so that users can register their file format accordingly.",
