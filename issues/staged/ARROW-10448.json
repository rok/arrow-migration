        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10448](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10448). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, PrimitiveArray::new passed with `null_count != 0` creates an array that does not follow the specification, as it is initialized with a\u00a0`None` null bitmap but a non-zero null_count.\r\n\r\nThis method also makes no attempt to check for the buffer's aligment, which leads to UB.\r\n\r\nSince a change in this method's signature requires a backward incompatible change, and it is only used in tests, I propose that we just remove it: we have good offers to create primitive arrays:\r\n \\* from an `ArrayData`,\r\n \\* from a vector or vector of optionals\r\n \\* from an iterator\r\n\r\nwhich covers all major cases.",
