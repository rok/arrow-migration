It works fine when the **open_mode is \"r\"** or the {**}file is located locally{**}.\r\n\r\nsome snippets:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport fsspec\r\nhdfs_file_path = \"hdfs://xxxxxx\"\r\nwith fsspec.open(hdfs_file_path, \"rb\") as f: \r\n# raise UnspportedOperation\r\n    f.readline() \n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nError logs:\r\n\u00a0\r\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/io.pxi in pyarrow.lib.NativeFile.readline()\r\n\r\nUnsupportedOperation:\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally from: https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/issues/810",

(I suppose there is no direct need for it for pyarrow itself)"
