The error means that for some reason, importing the pyarrow engine failed. This basically imports `pyarrow.parquet`. But it would be strange that this fails, since other tests with pyarrow.parquet just passed. The pyarrow engine also does `import pandas.core.arrays._arrow_utils` (see https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/42fd7e7d9a2c115af9a52f7f896d48b75a271efe/pandas/io/parquet.py#L74-L83), so maybe you could put that in the test explicitly to see it if errors.\r\n\r\nOn master we preserve the original import error and append it to the generic message, so that would help with debugging such cases. But so the released pandas does not yet do that.\r\n\r\n"
