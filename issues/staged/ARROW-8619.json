Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a breaking API change, but `MonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType` are different data types (and have different value sizes, which is not true of timestamps) and thus should be distinguished in the same way that DATE32 / DATE64 are distinguished, or TIME32 / TIME64 are distinguished\r\n\r\nThis may nominally simplify function / kernel dispatch",
