        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6866). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImprove the performance of hashCode(int) method for StructVector:\r\n1. We can get the child vectors directly, so there is no need to get the name from the child vector and then use the name to get the vector. \r\n2. The child vectors cannot be null, so there is no need to check it.\r\n\r\nThe performance improvement depends on the complexity of the hash algorithm. For computational intensive hash algorithms, the improvement can be small; while for simple hash algorithms, the improvement can be notable. ",
