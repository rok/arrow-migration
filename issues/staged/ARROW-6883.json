Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI didn't see other JIRA issues about this, but this is one significant matter to have complete columnar format coverage in the C++ library.\r\n\r\nThis functionality will flow through to the various bindings, so it would be helpful to add unit tests to assert that things work correctly e.g. in Python from an end-user perspective",
