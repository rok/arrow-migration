Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs referenced in [apache/arrow#13277\\|[https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13277],] we allocate scratch space memory every time we want to skip rows in the Go parquet reader despite this memory simply being discarded. We ideally should reuse scratch space when skipping to avoid these unnecessary allocations.",
