Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFragments are created on the fly when invoking a Scan. This means that a lot of the auxilliary/ancilliary data must be stored by the specialised Dataset, e.g. the FileSystemDataset must hold the path and partition expression. With the venue of more complex Fragment, e.g. ParquetFileFragment, more data must be stored. ",
