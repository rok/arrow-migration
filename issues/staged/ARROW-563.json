Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are some GCC versions in the wild that use `gcc-Version`\u00a0vs `gcc version`\u00a0in their version string. These are ones built with a different locale.\n\nNot a blocker as these are very rare occasions and rather more builds of GCC with uncommon/wrong flags.",
