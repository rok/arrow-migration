        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17414](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17414). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf we run the following code in R, we will get a C++ derived error message telling us to use `assume_timezone`.\r\nHowever, this error message is not helpful because there is no binding for the `assume_timezone` function in R.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\ntf <- tempfile()\r\nwriteLines(\"2004-04-01 12:00\", tf)\r\narrow::read_csv_arrow(tf, schema = arrow::schema(col1 = arrow::timestamp(\"s\", \"UTC\")))\r\n#> Error:\r\n#> ! Invalid: In CSV column #0: CSV conversion error to timestamp[s, tz=UTC]: expected a zone offset in '2004-04-01 12:00'. If these timestamps are in local time, parse them as timestamps without timezone, then call assume_timezone.\r\n#> \u2139 If you have supplied a schema and your data contains a header row, you should supply the argument `skip = 1` to prevent the header being read in as data.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to improve the error message or to allow `assume_timezone` to be used from R as well.\r\n(although `lubridate::with_tz()` and `lubridate::force_tz()` could be more useful within a dplyr query)",
