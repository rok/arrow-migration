        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16246](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16246). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are three possible elements to this:\r\n\r\nFirst, if the sink is slow, the hash-join node needs to pause emitting batches (after the hash table has been built, only applicable if we are doing spillover)\r\n\r\nSecond, if the left input to the hash join node is slow we may want to pause reading from the right input while we wait for the left input to catch up (I may have this backwards).  This is useful even if we don't have spillover.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we are busy spilling to disk we may need to ask the source to pause (not clear if this will be needed or not)",
