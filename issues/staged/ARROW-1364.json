Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe purpose would be to write only the record batch to the device memory, while leaving the Schema on the CPU. Similarly, record batches can be reconstructed through pointer arithmetic (the IPC loading as in `arrow/ipc/reader.h`) without having to copy the data to main memory",
