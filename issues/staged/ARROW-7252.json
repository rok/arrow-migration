        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7252](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7252). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile reading a very large parquet file with basically all string fields was very slow(430MB gzipped), after profiling with osx instruments, I noticed that a lot of time is spent in \"convert_byte_array\", in particular, \"reserving\" and allocating Vec::with_capacity, which is done before String::from_utf8_unchecked.\r\n\r\nIt seems like using String as the underlying storage is causing this(String uses Vec<u8> for its underlying storage), this also requires copying from slice to vec.\r\n\r\n\"Field::Str<String>\" is a pub enum so I am not sure how \"refactorable\" is the String part, for example, converting it into a &str(we can perhaps then defer the conversion from &[u8] to Vec<u8> until the user really needs a String)\r\n\r\nBut of course, changing it to &str can result in quite a bit of interface changes... So I am wondering if there are already some plans or solution on the way to improve the handling of the \"Field::Str\" case?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Reading a 1.5MM, 1000 column file(440mb) gz.parquet file, on MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019), improved from 3m20s to 2m20s.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut the problem is this will modify the signature of the Field::Str Variant."
