        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15586](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15586). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe substrait consumer currently interprets the ReadRel::filter in a Substrait plan as a best effort push-down filter.  It's not clear if this is the correct semantic interpretation at the moment.  I have opened https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/issues/137 to investigate.  Once that is resolved, if we predicted the semantics incorrectly, we should fix the consumer.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the Substrait semantics are found to agree with our interpretation we can close this issue.",
