Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe intent of `children_` was to use these in nested type builders. But `StructBuilder` has its own differently-named child builders member `field_builders_`. This bit of cruft should be cleaned up",
