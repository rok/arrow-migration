Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn some tests in the Arrow test suite there are cases where arrays are made without allocating real buffers of data, using `Buffer` of length 0 and with `nullptr`\u00a0as their data.\r\n\r\nIn this cases the `Array::ToString()` does lead to segfault, at least for Int arrays.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x0)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 frame #0: 0x0000000101dac696 libarrow.500.dylib`std::__1::enable_if<is_integer_type<arrow::NumericArray<arrow::Int32Type>::TypeClass>::value, arrow::Status>::type arrow::ArrayPrinter::WriteDataValues<arrow::NumericArray<arrow::Int32Type> >(this=0x00007ffeefbfea98, i=0)::'lambda'(long long)::operator()(long long) const at pretty_print.cc:152:73\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 149 \t\u00a0 enable_if_integer<typename T::TypeClass, Status> WriteDataValues(const T& array) {\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 150 \t\u00a0 \u00a0 const auto data = array.raw_values();\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 151 \t\u00a0 \u00a0 // Need to upcast integers to avoid selecting operator<<(char)\r\n-> 152 \t\u00a0 \u00a0 WriteValues(array, [&](int64_t i) { (*sink_) << internal::UpcastInt(data[i]); });\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 153 \t\u00a0 \u00a0 return Status::OK();\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 154 \t\u00a0 }\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 155\u00a0\t \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue can probably be worked around by checking if the data in the array is valid (at least for the most obvious cases, like NULLS or 0-length data) when building the string representation",

Also checking `raw_values != nullptr` might be another easy check."
