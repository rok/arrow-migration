Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen applying pyarrow.array() to a list of dict, the dict keys are reordered in ascending order.\r\n\r\nBecause of this I cannot preserve the original parquet data schema when doing transformations from py to arrow.\r\n\r\nIs the key reordering the intended behaviour ?\r\n\r\nIs there an existing workaround ?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEg.\r\n\r\nx = [\u00a0 \\{'z': '', 'y': {'b': '', 'a': ''}} ]\r\ny = pyarrow.array( x )\r\nprint( y )\r\nprint(y.to_pylist())\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
