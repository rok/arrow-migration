Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, `ExecBatch` does not handle chunked arrays when printing or slicing. The code assumes that if a value is not a scalar then it is an array, and so will fail on chunked array values.",

I bumped into this when working on ordered aggregation. The test cases I worked out for this involved chunked arrays (but not an `ExecPlan`) that triggered the described failure that led to this issue.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is possible to split to multiple `ExecBatch` instances, but I think this is not convenient for the user and potentially less efficient, e.g., in the context of streaming it is more efficient to consume a large `ExecBatch` with a chunked array than to consume multiple smaller `ExecBatch` instances with the same data.\r\n\r\nI believe the proposed code is simple enough to warrant a review. Let me know your thoughts."
