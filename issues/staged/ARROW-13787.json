Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI think it might be helpful to have cmake use an SHA256 hash to verify the third-party files it downloads. I can submit a PR for this.\r\n\r\nUpsides:\r\n - Downloads are further verified for integrity (in addition to the verification from https)\r\n - cmake stops complaining about missing verification (when `ARROW_VERBOSE_THIRDPARTY_BUILD=ON`)\r\n\r\nDownside:\r\n - Slightly more work in the future to add or update a third-party dependency.\r\n\r\nThe [cmake docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html) note:\r\n> Specifying\u00a0[URL_HASH] is strongly recommended for URL downloads, as it ensures the integrity of the downloaded content. It is also used as a check for a previously downloaded file, allowing connection to the remote location to be avoided altogether if the local directory already has a file from an earlier download that matches the specified hash.\r\nSHA256 was introduced in [cmake 2.8.7](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-2-8-7-now-available/), released in late 2011.",
