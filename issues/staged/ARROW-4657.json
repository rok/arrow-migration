Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`gbenchmark` is built during verification and thus we require a minimal version of CMake 3.6. I would have guessed that we should not require it as we do not need to build the benchmarks during the verification. I guess that a recent fix from `[~wesmckinn]` may have fixed this, but we should verify this before doing the next release.",
