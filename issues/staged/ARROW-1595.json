Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are installing package requirements for the Python build in two steps, and the second step is causing conda to downgrade NumPy, resulting in an ABI conflict and broken build. I'm not sure why this suddenly started happening, but installing the packages all at once and pinning the NumPy version should fix it\n\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/278202858#L9106",
