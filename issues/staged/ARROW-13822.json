Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo support ARROW-13813 we need a kernel that implements URL percent encoding (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1).  There is probably some nuance here.  For example, some encoders differentiate between encoding URL segments (which should encode '/') and full URLs (which should not encode '/') or whether or not UTF characters need to be encoded.\r\n\r\nHowever, a fairly narrow interpretation (always encode '/') would probably be sufficient for ARROW-13813.",
