Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRunning S3FileSystem::GetFileInfo() where the path is in the form \"bucket-name/dir-name\" and this is a bucket on AWS S3, it throws the following error:\r\n\r\n\"When reading information for key 'dir-name' in bucket 'bucket-name': AWS Error [code 15]: No response body.\r\n\r\nI tracked down the issue to the IsEmptyDirectory method, and noticed that removing kSep from this line:\r\n req.SetKey(ToAwsString(key) + kSep);\r\n\r\nfixes the issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't know why kSep is needed in the first place so I'm not sure what a good solution would be.\r\n Also, the key variable on entering IsEmptyDirectory is just the name of the directory (doesn't have separators).",
