        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4543](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4543). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to support zero-copy reads, we should update to the latest Google Flat Buffers code. A recent change now allows [C# support for directly reading and writing to memory other than byte](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/pull/4886)[]\u00a0which will make reading native memory using `Memory<byte>` possible.\r\n\r\nAlong with this\u00a0update, we should mark the flat buffers\u00a0types as `internal`, since they are an implementation detail of the library. From an API perspective, it is confusing to see multiple public types named \"Schema\", \"Field\", \"RecordBatch\" etc.",
