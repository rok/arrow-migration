I don't believe there are any examples yet, but there is a Flight implementation in C#.\r\n\r\nI did just start writing an example client in this PR, which might be helpful: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12044>\r\n\r\nThe particulars of Dremio's setup (e.g. authentication) are not going to be covered there, however. They have example clients for Java, Python, and Go which you can reference: <https://github.com/dremio-hub/arrow-flight-client-examples>\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
