Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a lot of verbosity in the construction of Arrays for testing purposes (multiple lines of setSafe(...) or set(...).\r\nWe should start adding a utility class to make test setup clearer and more concise, note this class should be located in arrow-vector test package and could be used in other module\u2019s testing by adding dependency:\r\n\r\n`<dependency>`\r\n`<groupId>org.apache.arrow</groupId>`\r\n`<artifactId>arrow-vector</artifactId>`\r\n`<version>${project.version}</version>`\r\n`<classifier>tests</classifier>`\r\n`<type>test-jar</type>`\r\n`<scope>test</scope>`\r\n`</dependency>`\r\n\r\nUsage would be something like:\r\n> try (IntVector vector = new IntVector(\u201cvector\u201d, allocator)) {\n> ValueVectorPopulator.setVector(vector, 1, 2, null, 4, 5);\n> output = doSomethingWith(input);\n> assertThat(output).isEqualTo(expected);\n> }",
