Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`google-cloud-cpp` was a monolithic package in `vcpkg` until 2021-08-31.  To support GCS I need to add this package to the `cpp/vcpkg.json` file.  I also want to take advantage of features to keep the build times under control.\r\n",
