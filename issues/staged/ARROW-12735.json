Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOne common issue when using gdb with Arrow is that it's non-trivial to explore and display Arrow data and metadata using built-in gdb functionality. One usually needs lots of hand typing of expressions.\r\n\r\nOne way to alleviate this would be to write a gdb plugin giving a higher-level view of Arrow C++ objects. This should be possible using the gdb Python API (though not trivial):\r\nhttps://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Python.html#Python\r\n\r\nA simple example:\r\nhttps://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/third_party/gdb_pretty_printer\r\n\r\nA sophisticated example of this is the gdb plugin for Python itself:\r\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/gdb/libpython.py\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttps://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdbundle-plugin-manager\r\nhttps://github.com/memfault/gdbundle\r\n",
