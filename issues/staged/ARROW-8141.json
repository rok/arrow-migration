See below the results on CLX 8280 cpu which is capable of AVX512.\r\n\n|Indictor|default sse build|avx512 build|avx512 build + Intrinsics|Intrinsics improvements|\r|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|BM_PlainDecodingBoolean/1024(G/s)|1.55394|3.77701|5.02805|1.331224964|\r|\n|BM_PlainDecodingBoolean/4096(G/s)|1.83472|5.3826|8.3443|1.550235945|\r|\n|BM_PlainDecodingBoolean/32768(G/s)|2.00957|6.1258|10.3793|1.694358288|\r|\n|BM_PlainDecodingBoolean/65536(G/s)|2.02249|6.20035|10.5778|1.706000468|\n",
