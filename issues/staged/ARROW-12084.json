Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn addition to `divide` which returns only the quotient, it'd be useful to have a function which returns both quotient and remainder (these are efficient to compute simultaneously), probably as a `struct<quotient: T, remainder: T>`.
