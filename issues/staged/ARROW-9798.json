Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would like to create a Decimal128Array in arrow.\r\n\r\nFor the StructArray, ListArray, MapArray we have constructors taking buffers, null_bitmap and such and the way to create arrays is clear.\r\n\r\nHowever, the only constructor available for Decimal128Array is with an ArrayData which seems strange. Why can't we have a constructor using a data buffer and a bitmap buffer?\r\n\r\nIf that is not possible, I would be interested with code for creating a Decimal128Array from a data and bitmap buffer.",
