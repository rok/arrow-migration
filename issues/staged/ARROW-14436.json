Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCopied from <https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/11279>\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nCompile arrow_objlib with ccache, clang and CCACHE_DEBUG=1 CCACHE_LOGFILE=./ccache.log\r\nFind in ./ccache.log:\r\nFailed; falling back to running the real compiler\r\nResult: unsupported compiler option\r\nDropping -fcolor-diagnostics fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nI suggest either opting into color diagnostics with WITH_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS or adding a way to disable it via DISABLE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS.\r\nIt would be good if this wouldn't be tied to ARROW_USE_CCACHE since its also relevant for:\r\n-DARROW_USE_CCACHE=OFF -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=emscripten_ccache.",
