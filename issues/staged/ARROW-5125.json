        "title": "[Python] Cannot roundtrip extreme dates through pyarrow",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5125](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5125). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nYou can roundtrip many dates through a pyarrow array:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```\n\r\n>>> pa.array([datetime.date(1980, 1, 1)], type=pa.date32())[0]\r\ndatetime.date(1980, 1, 1)\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut\u00a0(on Windows at least), not extreme ones:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```\n\r\n>>> pa.array([datetime.date(1960, 1, 1)], type=pa.date32())[0]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n File \"pyarrow\\scalar.pxi\", line 74, in pyarrow.lib.ArrayValue.__repr__\r\n File \"pyarrow\\scalar.pxi\", line 226, in pyarrow.lib.Date32Value.as_py\r\nOSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument\r\n>>> pa.array([datetime.date(3200, 1, 1)], type=pa.date32())[0]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n File \"pyarrow\\scalar.pxi\", line 74, in pyarrow.lib.ArrayValue.__repr__\r\n File \"pyarrow\\scalar.pxi\", line 226, in pyarrow.lib.Date32Value.as_py\r\n```\r\nThis is because datetime.utcfromtimestamp and datetime.timestamp fail on\u00a0these dates, but it seems we should be able to totally avoid invoking this function\u00a0when deserializing dates. Ideally we would be able to roundtrip these as\u00a0datetimes too, of course, but\u00a0it's less clear that this will be easy. For some context on this see\u00a0<https://bugs.python.org/issue29097>.\r\n\r\nThis may be related to ARROW-3176 and ARROW-4746",
