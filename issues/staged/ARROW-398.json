Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom the format specification \"Arrays having a 0 null count may choose to not allocate the null bitmap. Implementations may choose to always allocate one anyway as a matter of convenience, but this should be noted when memory is being shared.\"\n\nWhen the null count is 0 and the validity buffer has length 0, then in Java for now the simplest thing will be to allocate a new validity buffer with all 1's. See the corresponding C++ logic where a 0-length buffer is being written when the null count is 0: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/adapter.cc#L83\n\n",
