        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5971](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5971). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI think it's a good time to be bringing more attention to our work over the last 12-14 months on Arrow Flight. \r\n\r\nI would be OK to draft an initial version of the blog post, and I can circulate to others for review / edit / comment. If there are particular benchmarks you would like to see included, contributing code for that would also be helpful. My plan would be to show tcp throughput on localhost, and node-to-node throughput on a local gigabit ethernet network. I think the localhost throughput is important to show that Flight is a tool that you would want to reach for for faster throughput in high performance networking (e.g. 10/40 gigabit)",

We're also working on a post of our own, though that probably won't come in the near future.\r\n\r\nIt might be interesting to show Python numbers as well - it actually performs better than Java in our tests (don't think I can share actual data though)."
