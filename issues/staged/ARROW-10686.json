        "title": "[Rust] [DataFusion] Combine conjunctive filters",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10686](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10686). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using the DataFrame API, it is natural to chain together filter operations like this:\r\n```java\n\r\n.filter(col(\"l_commitdate\").lt(col(\"l_receiptdate\")))?\r\n.filter(col(\"l_shipdate\").lt(col(\"l_commitdate\")))?\r\n.filter(col(\"l_receiptdate\").gt_eq(lit(\"1994-01-01\")))?\r\n.filter(col(\"l_receiptdate\").lt(lit(\"1995-01-01\")))?\n```\r\nThis results in the following plan:\r\n```java\n\r\n    Filter: #l_receiptdate Lt Utf8(\"1995-01-01\")\r\n      Filter: #l_receiptdate GtEq Utf8(\"1994-01-01\")\r\n        Filter: #l_shipdate Lt #l_commitdate\r\n          Filter: #l_commitdate Lt #l_receiptdate\n```\r\nWe could implement an optimizer rule that combines these into a single filter:\r\n```java\n\r\nFilter: #l_receiptdate Lt Utf8(\"1995-01-01\") AND #l_receiptdate GtEq Utf8(\"1994-01-01\") AND #l_shipdate Lt #l_commitdate AND #l_commitdate Lt #l_receiptdate  \n```\r\nThis will lead to a more concise plan and possibly will reduce some overhead.",
