        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2671](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2671). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLately the main Travis CI build is running nearly 40 minutes long, e.g. here is the latest commit on master\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/builds/387326546\r\n\r\nA fair chunk of the long runtime is spent running the Python benchmarks at the end of the test suite. We should absolutely keep these running smoothly. However:\r\n\r\n- It may be just as valuable to run them on master nightly, and report in if they are broken\n- We could add a check to look at the commit message and run them in Travis CI if requested\n  \n  If others agree, I suggest that as soon as the packaging bot / nightly build tool is working properly, that we make these changes in the interest of improving CI build times",

I will add Slack notifications in ARROW-2682 to get notified about broken nightlies and I just have set up a daily builds for the Arrow Travis job. We need to check for `TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE == 'cron'` in the build then for tasks that should only run as part of the nightly."
