Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUntil we formally stop supporting Trusty it would be useful to be able to verify in Docker that builds work there. I still have an Ubuntu 14.04 machine that I use (and I've been filing bugs that I find on it) but not sure for how much longer",

Due to the conda-forge gcc7 migration, maintaining Trusty support has grown to be more of a pain.\r\n\r\nI've been able to get the conda-forge stuff working on Trusty with some effort so we might make the Travis build entry that builds Gandiva on Java use trusty, so we have both trusty and xenial CI entries"

Build as much possible with system packages? Build using our bundled ExternalProject setup? Or using the conda toolchain (then we would also need to use their compilers and nothing from trusty except libc)?"
