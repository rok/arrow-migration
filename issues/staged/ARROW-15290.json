        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15290](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15290). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAPI documentation for pyarrow has a few confusing \"mis\"links. As an example, on the page below, the link for \"csv.ReadOptions\" actually takes me to \"json.ReadOptions.\"\r\n\r\nI'm filing a bug because the pages were similar enough that I initially just assumed the csv parsing had limited functionality instead of realizing I was looking in the wrong place.\u00a0\r\n\r\nExample page:\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.dataset.CsvFileFormat.html>\r\n\r\nwhere ReadOptions and ParseOptions incorrectly link me to the JSON versions instead of CSV versions. ConvertOptions is correct, though.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how widespread this issue is as I have only looked and noticed the issue on this one page linked above.",

See the development branch where they now explicitly reference the csv module: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/4ddcb352dc49f7a91ffd160c8a708908cf003f33/python/pyarrow/_dataset.pyx#L1252-L1266>"
