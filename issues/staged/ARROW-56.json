Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Layout.md, we describe bitmaps for nulls (presumably same encoding for boolean data) and provide the C code for accessing a bit:\n\n`bitmask[j / 8] & (1 << (j % 8))`\n\nImplicitly this is LSB bit-endianness (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering) \u2013 see the discussion of bitpacking in the Parquet format: https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/Encodings.md#run-length-encoding--bit-packing-hybrid-rle--3\n\nIf this is what we want, we should make this aspect of the format explicit.
