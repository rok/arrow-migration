Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was doing some benchmarking and noticed that this function showed up as slow due to `\\_\\_memmove_avx_unaligned_erms`. I'm interested to investigate why this is, but for me it's fixed by changing the `std::vector::reserve` call to `std::vector::resize` and instead assigning elements into `buffered_indices_`. I'll add a Python benchmark that illustrates the problem to see if it shows up on other systems",
