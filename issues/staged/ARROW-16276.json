Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI typically use a command like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\ngit log fcab481 --grep=\".*\\[R\\].*\" --format=\"%s\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will find all the commits with `[R]`, since commit fcab481. I found commit fcab481 by going to the 7.0.0 release branch and then finding the last commit that is in the master branch as well as the 7.0.0 release. \r\n\r\n",
