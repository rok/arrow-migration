Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion on GitHub for ARROW-2676. We are setting CMAKE_C_FLAGS to the value of CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS, which is rather heavy-handed. Most of the stuff we are putting in the CXX_FLAGS is C++-specific related to warning suppressions, etc. The number of C-specific flags we need should be much smaller, probably just the optimization level, position-independent code setting, -fno-strict-aliasing, and some other standard stuff",
