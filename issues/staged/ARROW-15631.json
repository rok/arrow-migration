        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15631](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15631). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe always use `arrow-libs` for all versions for now. It has the following problems:\r\n\r\n1. `dnf update` is failed until downstream packages are rebuilt for new release.\r\n2. Users can't use different major versions such as 6.0.0 and 7.0.0 in the same system.\r\n\r\nExample for 1.: Groonga https://groonga.org/ uses Apache Arrow and it provides RPM package built with `arrow-libs`. If Groonga's package is built with `arrow-libs` for 6.0.0, `dnf update` is failed when we release `arrow-libs` for 7.0.0. Because `dnf update` tries to update `arrow-libs` to 7.0.0 from 6.0.0 but Groonga's package depends on `arrow-libs` for 6.0.0 not 7.0.0. This isn't resolved until Groonga's package is rebuilt with `arrow-libs` for 7.0.0. If we provide `arrow6-libs` for 6.0.0 and `arrow7-libs` for 7.0.0, `dnf update` isn't failed without rebuilding Groonga's package with `arrow7-libs`.\r\n",
