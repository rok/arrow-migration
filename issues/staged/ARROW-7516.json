Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6030#issuecomment-571877721>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt looks like the issue is that in the Benchmarks, `Length` is specified as `1_000_000`, and there has only been ~730,000 days since `DateTime.Min`, so this line fails:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/4634c89fc77f70fb5b5d035d6172263a4604da82/csharp/test/Apache.Arrow.Tests/TestData.cs#L130\r\n\r\nA simple fix would be to cap what we pass into `AddDays` to some number like `100_000`, or so.",
