        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18050](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18050). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a follow-up to ARROW-17966.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit tricky because we basically just pass the call today to:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n  using SubstraitCallToArrow =\r\n      std::function<Result<arrow::compute::Expression>(const SubstraitCall&)>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we have no way of knowing which options were actually used by the call.  Since we don't know this we have no way of checking to make sure we used all of the given options.\r\n\r\nThis is rather important since a given, but not recognized, option should be rejected.  This means the producer is asking for some kind of specific behavior and we are probably not going to be able to provide it.",
