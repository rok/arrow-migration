        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14496](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14496). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have some hardcoded links in the sphinx toctree to other parts of the docs (eg to <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/c_glib/, or https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/). \r\n\r\nThat means that for the versioned docs, those links still are absolute links, and not pointing to the versioned ones. \r\n\r\nFor those parts of the docs that we include in the versioning (so those that are hosted in the github pages, which is the case for C/GLib, js and R, and not the case for C#, Go, Rust, Julia, Matlab and Ruby), we should see if we can trick sphinx in creating a relative url (which in principle only is possible for internal links to another part of the sphinx docs).\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/27979803/external-relative-link-in-sphinx-toctree-directive has some potential ideas\r\n\r\nSee also thread on github issue: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/701#issuecomment-659062227",

Would make it easier to make the multi-version doc migration right after the 6.0.1 release."
