Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe added copies of these a while back as GitHub releases to handle rate limiting to our own bintray. We've since bumped our dependency versions but didn't update our copies in these mirrors, so they're currently useless.",

This week I had a GHA task fail when downloading from\u00a0<https://github.com/ursa-labs/thirdparty/releases/download>\u00a0with the error:\r\n```java\n\r\nConnection state changed (MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS == 100)!\r\nThe requested URL returned error: 429\r\nstopped the pause stream! \n```\r\nSo when these packages are updated, could we consider also uploading them to another place for added redundancy (and adding those URLs to ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake)?"

So this could be done manually pretty quickly. For more automated updating, see ARROW-6407."

This is now fixed. Note for future reference: when updating the third-party dependency mirror , be sure to set the tag to `latest` before clicking `Update release`.\r\n![image-2021-05-03-14-07-06-351.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13024937/image-2021-05-03-14-07-06-351.png)"
