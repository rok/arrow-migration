Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, to ensure fork safety when dealing with system resources, we add hand-baked getpid() tests in relevant APIs.\r\n\r\nWe could instead have a centralized after-fork facility such as:\r\n```c++\n\r\nAfterForkToken RegisterAtFork(std::function<void()> after_fork);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe returned token would have to be kept alive for as long as the after-fork callbacks are to be registered.\r\n\r\n(a more elaborate overload with before-fork, after-fork-in-parent, after-fork-in-child callbacks could also be added if necessary)\r\n",
