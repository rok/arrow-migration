Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe IPC reader operates at the granularity of an entire record batch; even if you're loading only a few columns, the entire record batch is read. ARROW-12683 partially addressed this issue by enabling this capability for sync read API, however, async read API still lacks of this capability.",
