        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7229](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7229). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nToday we have ConcatenateTables() and ConcatenateTablesWithPromotion() in C++. It's anticipated that they will allow more customization/tweaking. To avoid complicating the API surface, we should introduce a ConcatenateTableOption object, unify the two functions, and allow further customization to be expressed in that option object.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion:\u00a0<https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/1fa85b078dae09639de04afcf948aad1bfabd48ea8a38e33969495c5@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

The API has been unified and an option struct has been introduced. Maybe the test cases in table_test.cc could be refactored to reflect closely the API change."
