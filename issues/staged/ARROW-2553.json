Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current `pyarrow` wheels are not usable on older OSX releases due to a problem in the newest Xcode SDK. We need to set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to an older OSX release to avoid getting `Symbol not found: _os_unfair_lock_lock`.",
