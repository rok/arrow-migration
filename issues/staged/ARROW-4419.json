Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Java implementation will fail to decode a schema message if the message also contains (empty) body buffers (see ArrowMessage.asSchema's precondition checks). However, clients using default Protobuf serialization will likely write an empty body buffer by default.",

I suppose we can write a test harness in Python that uses gRPC directly to make sure our custom message emitting/parsing is all compliant with the Protobuf protocol"
