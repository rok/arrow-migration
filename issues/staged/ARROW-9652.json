Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was trying to write a reproducer for another bug, and I hit this one:\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE repro\r\nSTORED AS CSV\r\nLOCATION 'repro.csv';\r\n\r\nselect * from repro;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe contents of repro.csv are as follows (also attached):\r\n```Java\n\r\na,b\r\n1,100\r\n1,200\r\n2,100\r\n2,200\r\n2,300\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: a table of 2 columns, 5 rows is returned\r\n\r\nActual behavior: A panic occurs:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n> select * from repro;\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 0 but the index is 0', datafusion/src/optimizer/projection_push_down.rs:238:31\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll try and look into it myself, but I wanted to get the repro up first.\r\n",

Query took 0 seconds.\r\n```\r\n\r\n I still think the error message could use improvement (I think the error stems from the fact that the table is created with no columns). \r\n\r\nPerhaps the error should be on table creation if the columns are not specified"
