Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe way that Spark treats non-timezone-aware timestamps as session local can be problematic when using pyarrow which may view the data coming from toPandas() as time zone naive (but with fields as though it were UTC, not session local). We should document carefully how to properly handle the data coming from Spark to avoid problems.\n\ncc `[~bryanc]` `[~holdenkarau]`",
