        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13436](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13436). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe documentation for pyarrow.parquet.read_table states:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n \\* **columns** (_list_) \u2013 If not None, only these columns will be read from the file. A column name may be a prefix of a nested field, e.g. \u2018a\u2019 will select \u2018a.b\u2019, \u2018a.c\u2019, and \u2018a.d.e\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what should be the expected result if columns is an empty list.\u00a0 In pyarrow 3.0 this read in all columns (as long as use_legacy_dataset=False).\u00a0 In pyarrow 4.0 this doesn't read in any columns.\u00a0 I think this behavior (not reading in any columns) is the correct behavior (since None can be used for all columns) but we should clarify that in the docs.",

Note that the table still has the correct length (`num_rows`), even though it has no rows. Would be good to clarify in the docs.\r\n\r\n"
