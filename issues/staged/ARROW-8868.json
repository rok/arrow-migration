        "title": "[Python] Feather format cannot store/retrieve lists correctly?",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8868](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8868). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm seeing a very weird behavior when I try to store and retrieve a Pandas data-frame using the Feather format. Simplified example:\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame(data={\"scalar\": [1, 2], \"array\": [[1], [7]]})\r\n>>> df\r\n scalar array\r\n0     1   [1]\r\n1     2   [7]\r\n>>> df.to_feather(\"test.ft\")\r\n>>> pd.read_feather(\"test.ft\")\r\n  scalar                  array\r\n0      1                   [16]\r\n1      2  [1045468844972122628]\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the retrieved data is incorrect. I was originally trying to use the `feather-format` (not using Pandas directly) and that didn't work well either.\r\n\r\nBy playing around with the data-frame that is to be stored I can also get different but still incorrect behavior, e.g. a larger list, an error that says the file size is incorrect, or simply a segmentation fault.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is my first time using Feather/Arrow BTW.",

That's clearly buggy, and I suppose it is the same issue as the one I opened for structs (it's also a nested data type): ARROW-8860\r\n\r\nTemporary workaround is to disable compression, as I do in the linked issue (`compression=\"uncompressed\"` (the only problem is that this keyword is only passed through in pandas master, not yet released, for using it in `df.to_feather`)"
