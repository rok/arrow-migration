        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6281). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs follow up to ARROW-5028 and other issues, in a case like\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nvals = [['x' * 1024]] * ((2 << 20) + 1)\r\narr = pa.array(vals)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe child array of the ListArray cannot hold all of the string data. After the patch for ARROW-5028, an exception is raised rather than returning a malformed array. We could (with some effort) instead produce a chunked array of list<string> type",
