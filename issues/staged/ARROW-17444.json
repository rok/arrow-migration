        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17444](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17444). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello,\r\n\r\nI encountered this issue because it breaks my tests when I run\r\n```java\n\r\nrhub::check_for_cran()\n```\r\nBecause of this, I know it only affects Windows, all other OS checks pass.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you write files to a directory using arrow's\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nwrite_*\n```\r\n\u00a0functions, and then\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ncollect(open_dataset(directory))\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0you cannot delete a file in the directory, you get an error. This is best demonstrated in a reprex:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n# setup ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nlocal_prefix <- tempfile()\r\ndf <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5])\r\n\r\n\r\n# works fine -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nfs <- LocalFileSystem$create()\r\nfs$CreateDir(local_prefix)\r\nfsdir <- fs$cd(local_prefix)\r\nwrite_parquet(df, fsdir$path(\"1.parquet\"))\r\n\r\n#open_dataset(local_prefix) %>% collect()\r\n\r\nfsdir$DeleteFile(\"1.parquet\")\r\nunlink(local_prefix, recursive = TRUE)\r\n\r\n# doesn't work -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nfs <- LocalFileSystem$create()\r\nfs$CreateDir(local_prefix)\r\nfsdir <- fs$cd(local_prefix)\r\nwrite_parquet(df, fsdir$path(\"1.parquet\"))\r\n\r\nopen_dataset(local_prefix) %>% collect() # <-- ERROR IS CAUSED BY THIS\r\n\r\nfsdir$DeleteFile(\"1.parquet\") # <-- HERE IS WHERE YOU GET AN ERROR\r\nunlink(local_prefix, recursive = TRUE)\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere is the error I keep getting:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nError: IOError: Cannot delete file 'C:/Users/riaz/AppData/Local/Temp/Rtmp8qUlcx/file233c22f923d0/1.parquet'. Detail: [Windows error 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote that\r\n \\* I do not create an object from the `open_dataset` function. I simply call it.\r\n \\* I also call `collect` in order to pull the data. So I cannot see why the connection to the file should exist after collect is called\r\n \\* as mentioned above, all other OSes don't exhibit this behaviour.\r\n \\* my environment pane looks identical in both instances.\r\n \\* I do not need to restart R to delete the file. I can simply clear all objects from the workspace (rm(list = ls()) and then it works fine.",
