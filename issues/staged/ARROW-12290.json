Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor lineage and diffing purposes (used by protocols like DeltaLake) it can be useful to know the source of input data for a Dataframe. This adds the `input_file_name` function which, like Spark, returns the name of the file being read, or NULL if not available.",
