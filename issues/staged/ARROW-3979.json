I've added this to the `valgrind.supp` file:\r\n```java\n\r\n# Various issues in the re2 regexp constructor (used by Gandiva)\r\n{\r\n    <re2>:Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)\r\n    Memcheck:Cond\r\n    ...\r\n    fun:_ZN3re23RE2C1E*\r\n}\r\n{\r\n    <re2>:Use of uninitialised value of size 8\r\n    Memcheck:Value8\r\n    ...\r\n    fun:_ZN3re23RE2C1E*\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnother issue is the following macro:\r\n```java\n\r\n#define REGISTER_EXPORTED_FUNCS(classname) \\\r\n  static bool _registered_##classname = ExportedFuncsRegistry::Register(new classname)\r\n```\r\nIt allocates an object that's never deleted. One solution is to use a `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` instead. If not possible, then it should be silenced in the suppressions file."

Last week I have found out 5 issues. I have surpassed re2 and also silenced the second issue that you mentioned. I have fixed another two issues and remaining with one. Plan is to get it done today, if it spills, should be done by tomorrow."
