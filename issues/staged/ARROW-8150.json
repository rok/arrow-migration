It looks like there was a plan for this previously but it has not been implemented yet.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/a1eb440c92ae1c8edc93bc9ae646a8e371d756c6/rust/parquet/src/file/writer.rs#L182>\r\n\r\nI have a working implementation that adds a `key_value_metadata` field to the `WriterProperties` struct",
