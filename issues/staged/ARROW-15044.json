        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15044). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile it is odd for a library to configure OpenTelemetry exporters, there is a reason for this: the actual end-user is unable to configure it directly (as we use the C++ implementation, and the user is likely in Python or R), and often the \"important\" bits are all in C++, so it would be nice to have a way to dump the information collected.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, it would be nice to dump the data in an easily parseable format for further consumption.\r\n\r\nWe should enable the ostream exporter, as well as a custom exporter that dumps JSON. See <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/1111> for an example. See discussion on <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11906> as well.",
