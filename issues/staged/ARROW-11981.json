        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11981](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11981). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUnionDataset allows Fragments of multiple schemas and differing file formats to be scanned together as a single Dataset. This is useful functionality but makes the Dataset interface somewhat difficult to reason about since it must be general enough to accommodate UnionDataset.\r\n\r\nAfter ARROW-11928 it will probably be more natural to support unioning of datasets through a subclass of ExecNode. Reconciliation of differing schemas can then be trivially handled by a full ProjectNode.\r\n\r\nNote this would obviate both ARROW-11001 and ARROW-11749. In addition, Dataset could be simplified to a concrete class containing a set of compatibly typed/formatted Fragments.\r\n",
