Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe purpose of this is to avoid having to ever having to statically link libthrift.a into more than one shared library. Currently we are statically linking into libparquet.so, but there are some other efforts (e.g. libarrow_hiveserver2, which I'd eventually like to become production-worthy) where Thrift symbols are required. By factoring out the serialization code into a helper library we avoid the linking conundrum",
