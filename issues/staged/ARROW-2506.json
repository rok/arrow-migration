Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince the upgrade to flatbuffers 1.9.0, I'm seeing this error on the Ray CI:\r\n\r\narrow/cpp/src/plasma/format/plasma.fbs:234:0: error: default value of 0 for field status is not part of enum ObjectStatus\r\n\r\nI'm planning to just remove the '= 1' from 'Local = 1'. This will break the protocol however, so if we prefer to just put in a 'Dummy = 0' object at the beginning of the enum, that would also be fine with me. However, the ObjectStatus API is not stable yet and not even exposed to Python, so I think breaking it is fine.",
