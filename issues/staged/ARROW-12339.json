        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12339](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12339). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf you try to run a `COUNT (DISTINCT ..)` query on a boolean column you get the following panic:\r\n\r\nthread 'tokio-runtime-worker' panicked at 'Unexpected DataType for list', datafusion/src/scalar.rs:342:22\r\n\r\nWhile there is unlikely to be a big usecase for this, it would be nice for completeness sake. At the very least we should add a proper error message rather than a panic\r\n\r\nReproducer:\r\n```Java\n\r\necho \"true\" > /tmp/foo.csv\r\n ./target/debug/datafusion-cli\r\n\r\n> CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE t (a boolean) STORED AS CSV LOCATION '/tmp/foo.csv';\r\n\r\n0 rows in set. Query took 0 seconds.\r\n> select count(distinct a) from t;\r\n\r\nthread 'tokio-runtime-worker' panicked at 'Unexpected DataType for list', datafusion/src/scalar.rs:342:22\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\r\nArrowError(ExternalError(Canceled))\r\n```",
