Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently you need to do `fs.get_file_info([path])[0]` to get the info of a single path. We can make the function also accept that directly (instead of a list): `fs.get_file_info(path)`.",
