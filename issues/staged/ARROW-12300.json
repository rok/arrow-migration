        "title": "[C++] ArrowCUDA erroneously links to CUDA Runtime while only using CUDA Driver API",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12300](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12300). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs far as I can tell the Arrow GPU code only uses the CUDA driver API, but the CMake links it to the CUDA Runtime: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-3.0.0/cpp/src/arrow/gpu/CMakeLists.txt#L39 (`${CUDA_LIBRARIES`} is defined via the CMake `FindCUDA` module here: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDA.html#result-variables)\r\n\r\nBy default the static library for the CUDA Runtime will be used and things will get statically linked inside of the Arrow GPU library unnecessarily. Additionally, this can cause issues related to CUDA initialization as shown here: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/7600",
