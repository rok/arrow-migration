Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe print method for `SubTreeFileSystem` objects prints only the class name. Make it print more useful information, such as a filesystem URI including scheme. For example:\r\n```r\n\r\nprint(s3_bucket(\"ursa-labs-taxi-data\"))\r\n## SubTreeFileSystem: s3://ursa-labs-taxi-data\r\n```",
