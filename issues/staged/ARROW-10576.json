The next release is likely to be between Jan and Feb 2021, and the arrow crate will indeed support stable (if not using features that require nightly) in that release.\r\n\r\nAny opinions on this\u00a0 `[~jorgecarleitao]`?"

Therefore, this needs to wait for the next release.\r\n\r\n`[~comicfans]`, would pointing to a git hash in `Cargo.toml` help meanwhile?"
