Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing a dict column using pyarrow.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\norig = pd.read_parquet(\"original.parquet\")\r\norig.to_parquet(\"first_write.parquet\")\r\n\r\nfirst_write = pd.read_parquet(\"first_write.parquet\")\r\n\r\nprint(orig.equals(first_write))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n This incorrect results start appearing after index 1024. first_write.parquet was created after reading and then writing it again. I don't see any obvious pattern in the shuffled rows.\r\n\r\n![image-2020-12-30-01-20-45-183.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13017858/image-2020-12-30-01-20-45-183.png)\r\n \u00a0Original records\r\n ![image-2020-12-30-01-19-20-491.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13017857/image-2020-12-30-01-19-20-491.png)\r\n\r\nWritten records",
