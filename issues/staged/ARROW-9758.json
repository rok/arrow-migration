Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would like the ability to extend DataFusion by providing my own:\r\n \\* Logical plan optimization rules\r\n \\* Physical query planner for converting logical plan to physical plan\r\n\r\nLater, I would also like to be able to provide physical plan optimization rules but we don't have a physical optimizer yet.\r\n\r\nThese changes would allow people to extend DataFusion easily without implementing their own competing DataFrame APIs.",
