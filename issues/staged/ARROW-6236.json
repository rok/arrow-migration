Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI suspect that deserialization performance from Arrow to R vector can be improved by deduplicating strings locally prior to setting into R character vectors. You can see our corresponding deduplication logic in Python (which is a slightly different situation because Python does not have a GSHT, but we can have many references to the same object in an output NumPy array)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/python/arrow_to_pandas.cc#L409",
