Change the default IpcWriteOptions to write with V5 of the metadata\n1. Add tests from 1.0.0-little-endian along the 0.17.1 golden files (look at the IPC reader and writer unit tests)\n1. Fix any test failures (I think only NullArray is problematic).\n   \n   I have a draft of the above somewhere on my fork, if someone's interested in helping out, please reach out to me."
