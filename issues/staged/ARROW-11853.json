Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen cancellation (e.g. from a signal) happens, the CSV streaming reader will just hang.\r\n\r\nIt seems the problem is due to the fact that `TaskGroup::Append` will short-circuit if a cancellation occurred, but `csv::ColumnDecoder` doesn't expect errors from\u00a0`TaskGroup` (instead, it uses futures internally to communicate those errors).\r\n\r\nIncidentally,\u00a0`csv::StreamingReader` never calls `TaskGroup::Finish`.",
