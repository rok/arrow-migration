        "title": "[CI][Python] Ability to include pip packages in the conda environments",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14967](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14967). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor creating various conda environments, we currently have files like `conda_env_cpp.txt`, `conda_env_sphinx.txt`, `conda_env_python.txt`, etc \r\n\r\nThose can then be combined to create a specific conda environment with the subset of features you want, eg from the python docs:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n    conda create -y -n pyarrow-dev -c conda-forge \\\r\n        --file arrow/ci/conda_env_unix.txt \\\r\n        --file arrow/ci/conda_env_cpp.txt \\\r\n        --file arrow/ci/conda_env_python.txt \\\r\n        --file arrow/ci/conda_env_gandiva.txt \\\r\n        compilers \\\r\n        python=3.9 \\\r\n        pandas\r\n```\r\n\r\nor installed as additional packages into an existing one (eg `conda install --file arrow/ci/conda_env_python.txt` in conda-python.dockerfile).\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage of this approach is that you cannot (as far as I am aware) not list pip packages in those .txt files.   \r\nYou can do that with environment.yml files, but those then don't really compose together as we do with the txt files, I think.\r\n\r\ncc `[~kszucs]`",
