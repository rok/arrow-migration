Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'd like to be able to link arrow statically into my application.\n\nAt the moment, arrow can be built as a static library using the 'LIBARROW_LINKAGE' variable in CMakeLists.txt. I'd like to configure this behavior from the command line. Are there any objections of exposing the variable as a cached variable?",

I'll try to get that fixed in parquet-cpp before any work on arrow is done as we then would have a working template."
