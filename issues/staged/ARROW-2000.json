Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now when the plasma store replies to a GetRequest from a client, it sends many file descriptors over the relevant socket (by calling `send_fd`). However, many of these file descriptors are redundant and so we should deduplicate them before sending.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote that I often see the error \"Failed to send file descriptor, retrying.\" printed when getting around 100 objects from the store. This\u00a0may alleviate that.",
