        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9751](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9751). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMost math functions accept float32 and float64, `length` will accept Utf8 and lists soon, etc.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this story is to allow UDFs to accept more than one datatype.\r\n\r\nDesign: the accepted datatypes should be a vector ordered by \"faster/smaller\" to \"slower/larger\" (cpu/memory). When the plan reaches a UDF, we try to cast the input expression like before, from \"faster/smaller\" to \"slower/larger\".\r\n\r\n",
