Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should not expose gRPC symbols/APIs publicly, but should still provide a way to configure gRPC options as they may be needed in deployments (for instance, we ran into an issue with gRPC keepalives). In Java, this is fortunately solvable with reflection, but this is impossible in C++/Python.",
