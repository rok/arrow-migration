The packaging scripts for wheels need to be updated to also build against the AWS C++ SDK.  \r\nOptions to install it right now it to use the conda packages (or install from source).\r\n\r\nSo it's essentially a packaging task, but the error message you get could be more informative, though. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
