I've been asked enough about \"which style to use\" that I like the idea of UsePascalCaseForEverything https://github.com/google/styleguide/commit/db0a26320f3e930c6ea7225ed53539b4fb31310c#diff-26120df7bca3279afbf749017c778545R4277",

A canonical example is an inline method that just returns one\n -of the class's member variables.\""
