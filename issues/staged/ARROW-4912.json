        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4912](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4912). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently I think there is no way to specify custom column names for CSV files. It's possible to specify the full schema of the file, but not just column names.\r\n\r\nSee the related discussion here:\u00a0ARROW-3722\r\n\r\nThe goal of this is to re-use the CSV type-inference but still allow people to specify custom names for the columns. As far as I know, there is currently no way to set column names post-hoc, so we should provide a way to specify them before reading the file.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, ParseOptions(header_rows=0) is not currently implemented.\r\n\r\nIs there any current way to do this or does this need to be implmented?",

That sounds more universal than adding ad hoc options to the CSV reader.\r\n\r\nAs for the header_rows=0, can you open a separate issue?"
