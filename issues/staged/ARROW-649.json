Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~matei]` and the Stanford team have just open sourced Weld. It would be interesting to evaluate how we could move Arrow data to Weld's internal representation.\n\nWeld is here: https://github.com/weld-project/weld",

If that's the case, then building a bridge in C to pass contiguous memory held in Arrow C++ arrays should not be complicated.\n\nAs one logistical matter with missing data, Weld may not yet be able to interact with Arrow's validity bitmaps. We'll want to make sure that there's a primitive operator in the Weld DSL (or a plan to implement one) that can handle bitmap propagation in operations.\n\nLooks like Weld does not support null data yet: https://github.com/weld-project/weld/blob/master/python/grizzly/grizzly_impl.py#L285 \u2014 so the benchmarks presented aren't exactly apples to apples (having missing data handling in all pandas operations comes at high expense).\n\nI'm also interested to enable Weld to understand Arrow's string memory layout (offsets + data buffers).
