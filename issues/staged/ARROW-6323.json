Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAll file paths in R are wrapped in `fs::path_abs()`, which handles relative paths, but it doesn't expand `~`, so this fails:\r\n```java\n\r\n> df <- read_parquet(\"~/Downloads/demofile.parquet\")\r\n Error in io___MemoryMappedFile__Open(fs::path_abs(path), mode) :\r\n \u00a0 IOError: Failed to open local file '~/Downloads/demofile.parquet', error: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\nThis is fixed by using `fs::path_real()` instead.\r\n\r\nShould this be properly handled in C++ though? cc `[~pitrou]`",
