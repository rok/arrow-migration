Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom discussion in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11782\r\n\r\nIt'd be useful to consumers of Scanner to receive an iterator of scanned record batches or apply a visitor to batches as they are scanned without handling ScanTasks. For example, this could enable aggregations or other computations which don't require the entire table to be materialized.",
