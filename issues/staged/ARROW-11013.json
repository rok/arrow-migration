        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11013](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11013). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the CSV Reader assumes very clean input data which does not have things like leading spaces. This means parsing data like the TPC-H 'answers' set from the databricks/tpch_dbgen repo does not work (like below).\r\n\r\n```\r\nl|l|sum_qty|sum_base_price|sum_disc_pricesum_chargeavg_qtyavg_priceavg_disccount_order           \r\nA|F|37734107.00|56586554400.73|53758257134.87|55909065222.83|25.52|38273.13|0.05|               1478493\r\n```",
