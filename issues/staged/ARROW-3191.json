        "title": "[Java] Add support for ArrowBuf to point to arbitrary memory.",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3191](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3191). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now ArrowBuf can only point to memory managed by an Arrow Allocator. This is because in many cases we want to be able to support hierarchical accounting of\u00a0memory and the ability to transfer memory ownership between separate allocators within the same hierarchy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time,\u00a0there are definitely times where someone might want to map some amount of arbitrary off-heap memory. In these situations they should still be able to use ArrowBuf.\r\n\r\nI propose we have a new ArrowBuf constructor that\u00a0takes an input that subclasses an interface similar to:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\npublic abstract class Memory\u00a0 {\r\n  protected final int length;\r\n  protected final long address;\r\n  protected abstract void release();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe then make it so all the memory transfer semantics and accounting behavior are noops for this type of memory. The target of this work will be to make sure that all the fast paths continue to be efficient but some of the other paths like transfer can include a conditional (either directly or through alternative implementations of things like ledger).",

It would be great to\u00a0be able to start using the Memory abstraction for several things. For example, being able to put an ArrowBuf in an ArrowBuf while\u00a0overloading the release() semantics becomes possible."
