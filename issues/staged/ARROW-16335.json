Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`verify-release-candidate.bat` uses the following command to run the C++ tests:\r\n```Java\n\r\nctest -VV\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has two problems:\r\n- output is verbose even for successful tests, making it difficult to find errors in the log\n- tests are run serially even on a many-core machine\n  \n  I would suggest instead something like:\n  ```Java\n  \n  ctest -jN --output-on-failure\n  ```\n  \n  (where N is the available number of hardware threads / CPU cores)",
