        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13333](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13333). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe existence FileSystemDatasetWriteOptions::basename_template would seem to imply that the dataset writer may write multiple files for a given partition.\u00a0 However, the current implementation will always create one file per directory.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the desired behavior is here but the two obvious choices are:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\\* Get rid of FileSystemDatasetWriteOptions::basename_template (or at least the \\{i} parameter)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\\* Add an option to limit how many rows/bytes are put in a single file\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nARROW-12358 is probably worth mentioning as whatever strategy is come up with here should probably be compatible with supporting append mode in the future.",
