See example below.\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nprint(pa.__version__)\r\n# 2.0.0\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"time\": pd.to_datetime([0, 0])})\r\n\r\ntime_field = pa.field(\"time\",type=pa.timestamp(\"ms\", tz=\"utc\"), nullable=False)\r\nschema = pa.schema([time_field])\r\n\r\ntab = pa.Table.from_pandas(df, schema)\r\n\r\ntab.to_pandas() \r\n\r\n# File \".../pandas_compat.py\", line 777, in table_to_blockmanager\r\n#   table = _add_any_metadata(table, pandas_metadata)\r\n# File \".../pandas_compat.py\", line 1184, in _add_any_metadata\r\n#   tz = col_meta['metadata']['timezone']\r\n# TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/705",

If you remove `tz=\"utc\"`, it does not error. (Not proposing that as a solution, just trying to provide more information on where the error is being triggered.)"

That is certainly a case that should work, but so the to_pandas conversion cannot deal at the moment with this inconsistent metadata.\r\n\r\nWill take a look at it next week"
