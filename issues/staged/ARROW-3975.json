Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome integration tests with 3rd party projects have gotten moved to https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/integration which doesn't look right to me. I suggest we either find a new home in the codebase for the protocol integration tests or move the 3rd party integration tests somewhere else",
