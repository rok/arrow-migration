Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRIght now, we publish the ts source files alongside the js, mjs, map, and .d.ts files. Because of how tsc works (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10704), it will use the ts files instead of the d.ts files. That can lead to problems with compiling with never tsc versions and is more expensive than if tsc uses the d.ts files. To avoid this problem, we should move the sources into a sources directory. We need to make sure that declaration maps still work. ",
