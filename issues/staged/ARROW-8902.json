Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, as far as I can tell, when you perform a `select count(\\*) from dataset` in datafusion against a parquet dataset, the way this is implemented is by doing a scan on column 0, and counting up all of the rows (specifically I think it counts the # of rows in each batch).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, for the specific case of just counting _everythign_ in a parquet file, you can just read the rowcount from the footer metadata, so it's O(1) instead of O(n)",
