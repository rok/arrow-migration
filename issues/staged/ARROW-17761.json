Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen reading from s3 failed, the error message user get is\u00a0\r\n> Error in url(file, open = \"rb\") : URL scheme unsupported by this method\r\nThe reason is in arrow:::make_readable_file, the code tries to create a filesystem from path and if this step failed, it tries to run is_url which doesn't supports s3. s3 reading can fail due to many reasons, from auth to s3 path doesn't exist. The request is to make the error message more useful.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n> > arrow:::make_readable_filefunction (file, mmap = TRUE) \n> \\{\n> if (inherits(file, \"SubTreeFileSystem\")) {\n> filesystem <- file$base_fs\n> path <- sub(\"/$\", \"\", file$base_path)\n> file <- filesystem$OpenInputFile(path)\n> }\n> else if (is.string(file)) \\{\n> if (is_url(file)) {\n> file <- tryCatch({\n> fs_and_path <- FileSystem$from_uri(file)\n> fs_and_path$fs$OpenInputFile(fs_and_path$path)\n> }, error = function(e) \\{\n> MakeRConnectionInputStream(url(file, open = \"rb\"))\n> })\n> }",
