        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1509](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1509). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe structure of the stream in `arrow::py::WriteSerializedObject` is generated on an ad hoc basis \u2013 the components of the stream would be easier to manipulate if this were internally a generic stream of IPC messages. For example, one would be able to examine only the union that represents the structure of the serialized payload and leave the tensors undisturbed",
