        "title": "[Java] Remove dependency on optional JDBC ResultSet method",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16529). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~jswenson]` points out that the fix for ARROW-16035 uses the ResultSet.isLast() method, which is listed as optional for vendor support in the (likely common) condition that the result set is forward-scrollable only.\u00a0 This new code replaced dependency on ResultSet.isAfterLast(), which is similarly annotated as optional in the same context (and has the additional challenge of being non-deterministic in the case of empty result sets).\u00a0 To eliminate these dependencies, we propose the following:\r\n1. The ArrowVectorIterator returned from processing ResultSets will _always_ have at least one element, meaning hasNext() will return true initially, even in the case of empty ResultSets.\n1. Calling ArrowVectorIterator.next() will establish whether there is actual data to be supplied, and will return an \"empty\" VectorSchemaRoot when an empty ResultSet was supplied originally.\n1. Subsequent calls to ArrowVectorIterator.hasNext() will return false in the case when an empty ResultSet was supplied.\n   \n   This is a behavior change, in that the current ARROW-16035-patched code returns false today when an empty ResultSet was supplied, _and_ the JDBC driver optionally implements ResultSet.isLast().",
