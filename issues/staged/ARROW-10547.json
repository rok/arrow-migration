        "title": "[Rust][DataFusion] Filter pushdown loses filters if below a user defined node",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10547](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10547). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have a LogicalPlan like this (where \"Extension\" is some extension node type):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n    Extension [non_null_column:Utf8]\r\n      Filter: #state Eq Utf8(\"MA\") [city:Utf8;N, state:Utf8;N, borough:Utf8;N]\r\n        InMemoryScan: projection=None [city:Utf8;N, state:Utf8;N, borough:Utf8;N]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run this plan through `ExecutionContext::optimize` the plan that results is as follows (note the filter has been lost):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n    Extension [non_null_column:Utf8]\r\n      InMemoryScan: projection=Some([0, 1, 2]) [city:Utf8;N, state:Utf8;N, borough:Utf8;N]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have debugged the problem and the root cause of the issue is that the FilterPushdown logic is not recursing into the inputs of user defined nodes. I will get a PR up showing and fixing the problem.\r\n\r\nMore generally, I am not sure how / if the filter pushdown logic would work if there are multiple child inputs as no existing LogicalPlan variant his multiple inputs at this time. We will have to handle this when / if we want to support joins (typically filters get  pushed down each join input if possible)\r\n",
