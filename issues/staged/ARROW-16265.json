        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16265](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16265). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd a note [here](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/windows.html#windows-dependency-resolution-issues) that `ZSTD_MSVC_STATIC_LIB_SUFFIX` will be automatically set to `_static `if MCVS is used (see [PR #7388](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7388)) and the option needs to be passed as` -DZSTD_MSVC_STATIC_LIB_SUFFIX=. `Maybe a Log message in case of set suffix would also make sense.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue due to the current VCPKG version deviating from the zstd_static.lib naming scheme in a recent commit,",
