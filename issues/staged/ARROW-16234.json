Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDidn't see this in the library already so apologies if overlooked, but I think it would be nice to add a compute kernel for ranking. Here is a similar function in pandas:\r\n\r\n<https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.rank.html>",

However, I'm wondering if you think we should mirror what pandas does in cases of ties or pick another default. Pandas interpolates an average for tied rankings by default, which of course is going to change our returned data type. Not sure if we want to stray from the integral return value as a default or instead pick another thing like dense ranking"

In my current design I was thinking we should delegate as much responsibility to the standard sorting behavior, but AFAICT there are only SortOptions to rank NULLs at the start or the end, not necessarily to ignore NULL altogether. If we want to completely remove NULL from being calculated in the ranking algorithm I wonder if we should try and work that up the class hierarchy a bit to to the same thing in general sorting"

This is what we do for other similar kernels (e.g. quantile I think where you can choose to interpolate and get a float, or not interpolate and get the original data type)."
