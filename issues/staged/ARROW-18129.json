Similar to numpy.get_include\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \"\"\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 return _os.path.join(_os.path.dirname(__file__), 'include') \n```\r\nThis returns something like:\r\n```java\n\r\n/path/to/myconda/envs/envname/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pyarrow/include\n```\r\nwhich does not exist in a conda environment. The path where the headers actually get installed is to:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n$ echo $CONDA_PREFIX\r\n/path/to/myconda/envs/envname\r\n\r\n$ ls $CONDA_PREFIX/include/arrow | head\r\nadapters\r\napi.h\r\narray\r\narray.h\r\nbuffer_builder.h\r\nbuffer.h\r\nbuilder.h\r\nc\r\nchunked_array.h\r\nchunk_resolver.h\r\n```",

            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18129?focusedCommentId=17634821) by Alenka Frim (alenka):*\nYes, in case of using conda the Arrow C++ headers are not found in the python package (`{}pyarrow/include){`} due to conda recipe using `{}PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP_HEADERS=0{`}, see: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/16fd7f3fabbe663c161899d197deb66a7ec188b5/dev/tasks/conda-recipes/arrow-cpp/build-pyarrow.sh#L11>\r\n\r\nWith Apache Arrow 10.0.0 the C++ code connected to PyArrow (PyArrow C\\\\) has been moved to the python package and so the header files for PyArrow C\\\\ should always be included in the package itself. To track that work we created another issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18340.\r\n\r\nRegarding the headers for Arrow C\\\\: we should add info in the documentation/docstrings to make it clear that the\u00a0 Arrow C\\\\ header files are not located in the python package if one is using conda.\r\n\r\nWe could also add `$CONDA_PREFIX/include/arrow` path in the `get_include()` function if one is using conda. `[~apitrou]` what is your opinion on that?"
