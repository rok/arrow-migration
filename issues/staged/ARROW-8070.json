Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWas messing around with some nested arrays and found a pretty easy to reproduce segfault:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nPython 3.7.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jan  7 2020, 22:33:48)\r\n[GCC 7.3.0] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import numpy as np, pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> pa.__version__\r\n'0.16.0'\r\n>>> np.__version__\r\n'1.18.1'\r\n>>> x=[np.array([b'a',b'b'])]\r\n>>> a = pa.array(x,pa.list_(pa.binary()))\r\n>>> a\r\n<pyarrow.lib.ListArray object at 0x7fd948b108a0>\r\n[\r\n  [\r\n    61,\r\n    62\r\n  ]\r\n]\r\n>>> a.cast(pa.string())\r\nSegmentation fault\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know if that cast makes sense, but I left the checks on, so I would not expect a segfault from it.",
