Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should be able to provide a custom data stream as the result of Flight do_get in Python. In particular, when returning data produced on the fly, or when returning a large Pandas DataFrame, it'd be nice to provide data in chunks as it becomes available, rather than having to copy everything into a Table first.\r\n\r\nOn the Python side, a FlightDataStream wrapper that accepts RecordBatches from a Python generator should suffice.",
