Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee ARROW-9083. The current `IndexBoundsCheck` is specialized to skip a comparison for unsigned integers and uses 0 as the lower bound for signed integers. This could be generalized so that we could check e.g. if int64 values will fit in the int32 range",
