        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4427](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4427). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's hard to find and modify the [\"Contributing to Apache Arrow\"](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW/Contributing+to+Apache+Arrow) and other developers' wiki pages in Confluence.\u00a0If these were moved to inside the project web page, that would make it easier.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 steps to this:\r\n1. Create a new directory inside of `arrow/docs/source` to house the wiki pages. (It will look like the [cpp](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/docs/source/cpp) or [python](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/docs/source/python) directories.)\n1. Copy the wiki page contents to new `\\*.rst` pages inside this new directory.\n1. Add an `index.rst` that links to them all with enough description to help navigation.\n1. Modify the Sphinx index page [`arrow/docs/source/index.rst`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/index.rst) to have an entry that points to the new index page made in step 3\n1. Modify the static site page [`arrow/site/_includes/header.html`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/8e195327149b670de2cd7a8cfe75bbd6f71c6b49/site/_includes/header.html#L33)\u00a0to point\u00a0to the newly created page instead of the wiki page.\n   \n   \u00a0",

Am I understanding that maybe a number of the wiki pages should be moved\u2014anything not directly related to Jira?
