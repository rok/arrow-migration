        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6481](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6481). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCase: Dataset wit 20k columns. Amount of rows can be 0.\r\n\r\n`pyarrow.csv.read_csv('20k_cols.csv')` works rather fine if no convert_options provided.\r\n\r\nTook 150ms.\r\n\r\nNow I call `read_csv()` with column types mapping that marks 2000 out of these columns as string.\r\n\r\n`pyarrow.csv.read_csv('20k_cols.csv', convert_options=pyarrow.csv.ConvertOptions(column_types=\\{'K%d' % i: pyarrow.string() for i in range(2000)}))`\r\n\r\n(K1..K19999 are column names in attached dataset).\r\n\r\nMy task globally is to read everything as string, avoid any inferring.\r\n\r\nThis takes several minutes, consumes around 4GB memory.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't look sane at all.",

Worth noting that it works so bad even if dataset has 0 rows, so this performance problem happens on reading column header."
