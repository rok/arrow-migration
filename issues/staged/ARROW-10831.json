Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimilar function as <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.quantile.html>\r\nSupport chunked array, and calculate multiple quantiles at once.\r\n\r\nPossibly implement features in steps:\r\n - implement exact quantile kernel which records all chunks and partition at finalize\r\n - reduce memory footprint for integer inputs by maintaining \"value:count\" histogram\r\n - implement approximate quantile kernel without storing input values",
