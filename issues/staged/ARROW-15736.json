Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNumpy and Pandas both have `argmin` and `argmax`, for the common use case of finding values in parallel arrays which correspond to min or max values. Proposals:\r\n \\* `min_max_index` for arrays\r\n \\* `hash_min_max_index` for aggregations\r\n \\* some ability to break ties:\r\n \\*\\* `min_max_index` for tables with multiple sort keys, similar to `sort_indices`\r\n \\*\\* `min_max_indices` for arrays to match all equal values",
