Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems to me that Arrow only supports at the moment the \"AssumeRole\" AWS STS API, but not the other options offered:\r\n \\* <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison>\r\n \\* <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/cpp/api/LATEST/class_aws_1_1_auth_1_1_s_t_s_assume_role_web_identity_credentials_provider.html>\r\n\r\nI am clearly no security/infra expert, but it seems that the configuration \"AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\" is used commonly in Kubernetes setups, and I believe it would be beneficial for Arrow C++ & Python library to support.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, a workaround is to call directly `aws sts` to generate a temporary session, but it is a fairly painful solution as the session expires, all PyArrow objects with an S3 filesystem (datasets, ...) need to be re-built with new credentials.\u00a0",

For testing, though, my intuition is that we can't do much for integration testing of such a feature, at least not with our current CI."

Looking at the code and both PRs, it seems\u00a0 like PR #10088 is actually not adding the capabilities in Python. PR #8977 seems to would have added this.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am missing something here.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n-Tobias"
