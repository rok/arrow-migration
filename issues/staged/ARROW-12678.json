Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be useful if the various compression encodings (lz4 etc) were available on serialize. These options are available in many of the other language versions of Arrow and supporting this in JavaScript would aid interoperability.",
