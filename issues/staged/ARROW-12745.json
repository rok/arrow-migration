By definition their result is an integral value, and R and SQL both return an integer type. On the other hand, numpy returns `float64`."

In most SQL engines I've looked at, the `ceil` and `floor` functions\u00a0return a column with the same type as the input."

I have no objection against this, and now recognize that my doubt arose from mixing the mathematical definition of an integral value with the type system of computing tools. Thanks!"
