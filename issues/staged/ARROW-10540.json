Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently,\u00a0`filter` support is limited to a set of types, and these types cannot be arbitrarily nested. This hints at a fundamental limitation of the design, that is currently typed (in rust's sense).\r\n\r\nHowever, this operation is fundamentally un-typed: we do not require knowing type information to filter an array.\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks the development of an abstraction to support these operations for arbitrary types.",
