Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, only an internal factory for GCS filesystem testing is provided. We need to add a public factory function, e.g.:\r\n```c++\n\r\nstatic Result<std::shared_ptr<S3FileSystem>> GcsFileSystem::Make(\r\n    const GcsOptions& options,\r\n    const io::IOContext& = io::default_io_context());\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
