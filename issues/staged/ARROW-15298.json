        "title": "[C++] Linking error for debug build on Windows",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15298](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15298). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI experienced a linking error while building the debug flavor of the project I am working on, that links dynamically the arrow libraries, on Windows. Specifically the error is described in [Linker Tools Warning LNK4098](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-warning-lnk4098?view=msvc-170).\r\nThe issue stems from the following CMake line, [arrow/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/8b440d1b5df4a0e58bcaa422b83e6d6ff1213b5f/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L643).\r\n\r\nThe solution that worked in my case was to explicitly mention which libraries to exclude when building the release and debug flavor, following the table at [Linker Tools Warning LNK4098](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-warning-lnk4098?view=msvc-170). Specifically the aforementioned link to the Microsoft page describes in detail which libraries to exclude when linking dynamically with C run-time, i.e.,\r\n```bash\n\r\nNOT ARROW_USE_STATIC_CRT\n```\r\n.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for debug flavor builds, the /MDd or /MTd options might need to be set explicitly. I pass that from my project's configuration but I think it is not done explicitly within Arrow CMake files. Relevant link [Linker Tools Error LNK2001](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-error-lnk2001?view=msvc-160), read segment \"If you link to the release mode libraries when building a debug version [...]\"\r\n\r\nApache Arrow ticket that introduced the aforementioned CMake line change and dealt with the same issue: ARROW-4014",
