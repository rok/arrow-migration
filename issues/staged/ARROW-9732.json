Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~andygrove]` implemented what I would describe as a \"limit pushdown\" optimization within Limit here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7958#discussion_r470175966\r\n\r\nHowever, it was implemented by directly instantiating Partition objects during plan execution. This \"pick the top N from each partition and then pick the top N from the merged result\" is an example of operator pushdown that could be done at planning time\r\n\r\nThis ticket tracks the work to add some way to represent the in the planning stage, rather than execution, in order to open up more optimization opportunities. \r\n\r\nOne example of pushdown that could potentially happen at planning time would be pushing the limit down past Projections for example.
