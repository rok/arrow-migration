        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5588). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUnionBuilders (for both sparse and dense mode unions) are not currently supported by MakeBuilder or ArrayFromJSON. This increases friction when working with and testing against union arrays, and support should be added to both. For ArrayFromJSON each entry must be specified with a (type code, value) pair:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nArrayFromJSON(union_({field(\"lint\", list(int32())), field(\"str\", utf8())}), R\"([\r\n  [0, null],\r\n  [1, \"hello\"],\r\n  [0, [1, 2]],\r\n  [1, \"world\"]\r\n])\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nDenseUnionBuilder currently requires the user to explicitly input offsets, but if it were modified to hold pointers to child builders (as ListBuilder, for example) then those offsets could be derived from the lengths of child builders (which is much more user friendly).",
