        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14448](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14448). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current `pa.array(..)` docstring has the following note:\r\n\r\n> Localized timestamps will currently be returned as UTC (pandas\u2019s native representation). Timezone-naive data will be implicitly interpreted as UTC.\r\n\r\nThis is IMO quite confusing. While _technically_ somewhat correct (we do store UTC values under the hood for timezone aware data, and values \"as if\" in UTC for timezone naive data), it's not what the user actually gets returned. The type of the returned array does preserve the timezone if possible, or will have no timezone (also no UTC) when converted from naive timestamps.",
