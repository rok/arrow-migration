Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom the article at http://www.productive-cpp.com/improving-cpp-builds-with-split-dwarf/, it should be possible to split debug information from .o files to have faster C++ builds and smaller disk footprint of libraries / executables. This is useful for development builds.\r\n",

            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3491?focusedCommentId=16646446) by Antoine Pitrou (apitrou):*\nRunning some timings here (Ubuntu 18.04, gcc 7.3.0), on the ARROW-3442 branch:\r\n- cold debug build (ccache flushed) without split DWARF:\n  ```Java\n  \n  real\t1m43,742s\n  user\t11m4,532s\n  sys\t0m46,878s\n  ```\n- cold debug build (ccache flushed) with split DWARF:\n  ```Java\n  \n  real\t1m44,847s\n  user\t11m17,830s\n  sys\t0m48,983s\n  ```\n  \n  So there doesn't seem to be an improvement in full build time. As for the disk footprint:\n- without split DWARF:\n  ```Java\n  \n  $ du -h --max-depth=1 build-test/\n  272M\tbuild-test/debug\n  696K\tbuild-test/double-conversion_ep\n  27M\tbuild-test/double-conversion_ep-prefix\n  256K\tbuild-test/CMakeFiles\n  321M\tbuild-test/src\n  20K\tbuild-test/tools\n  24K\tbuild-test/examples\n  116M\tbuild-test/jemalloc_ep-prefix\n  737M\tbuild-test/\n  ```\n- with split DWARF:\n  ```Java\n  \n  $ du -h --max-depth=1 build-test/\n  198M\tbuild-test/debug\n  492K\tbuild-test/double-conversion_ep\n  27M\tbuild-test/double-conversion_ep-prefix\n  260K\tbuild-test/CMakeFiles\n  312M\tbuild-test/src\n  20K\tbuild-test/tools\n  24K\tbuild-test/examples\n  116M\tbuild-test/jemalloc_ep-prefix\n  654M\tbuild-test/\n  ```\n"
