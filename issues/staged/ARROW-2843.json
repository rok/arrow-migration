        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2843](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2843). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nChange in [ARROW-1785](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1785)\r\n\r\nBreaks backward compatibility with schema generated in prior versions of Arrow, as VectorLayout field was removed from Field table.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely not supported behavior in FlatBuffers.\r\n\r\nI suggest to put back following field\r\n```java\n\r\nlayout: [ VectorLayout ] (deprecated);\r\n```\r\n\u00a0into\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ntable Field \r\n```\r\nand mark it \"deprecated\" - as shown above\r\n\r\nIt will also require putting back\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ntable VectorLayout\r\n```\r\nwhich can have all the deprecated fields as well.\r\n\r\ncode generation footprint will be minimal in this case, as\u00a0FlatBuffers\u00a0won't generate getters for deprecated fields, but it will really solve backward compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nAlso may be a good idea to introduce \"version\" into Schema.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

We do already have a metadata version number. \r\n\r\nWe've made no guarantees of backwards compatibility in the columnar format metadata yet, so we have broken no contracts with users.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not pleased that there are still a number of underspecified parts of the columnar format and metadata. As an example, I proposed a more complete Interval / Timedelta type about a year ago and these changes have still not been implemented. \r\n\r\nI would very much appreciate if Dremio and other parties depending on Arrow in production would work more proactively with me and others in the Arrow community to reach a point where we can declare a stable 1.0 version of the columnar format and its metadata. In particular, if any more breaking changes are required (I hope that there will not be), that we make them as soon as possible to minimize disruption to applications."

We have failed to make progress since mid-2017, why is that? I have been trying consistently to advance to a 1.0 release; can we not work together to finalize the binary protocol? "
