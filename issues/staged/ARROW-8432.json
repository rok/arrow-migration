Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/ursa-labs/crossbow/11128?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link\r\n\r\nThis is caused by an HTTP request failure https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/docker/conda-python-hdfs.dockerfile#L36\r\n\r\nWe should probably not rely on https://www.apache.org/dyn/mirrors/mirrors.cgi to get tarballs. Currently there are:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nci/docker/conda-python-hdfs.dockerfile\r\n36:RUN wget -q -O - \"https://www.apache.org/dyn/mirrors/mirrors.cgi?action=download&filename=hadoop/common/hadoop-${hdfs}/hadoop-${hdfs}.tar.gz\" | tar -xzf - -C /opt\r\n\r\nci/docker/linux-apt-docs.dockerfile\r\n57:RUN wget -q -O - \"https://www.apache.org/dyn/mirrors/mirrors.cgi?action=download&filename=maven/maven-3/${maven}/binaries/apache-maven-${maven}-bin.tar.gz\" | tar -xzf - -C /opt\r\n\r\npython/manylinux1/scripts/build_thrift.sh\r\n22:  \"https://www.apache.org/dyn/mirrors/mirrors.cgi?action=download&filename=${THRIFT_DOWNLOAD_PATH}\" \\\r\n\r\npython/manylinux201x/scripts/build_thrift.sh\r\n20:wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/thrift/${THRIFT_VERSION}/thrift-${THRIFT_VERSION}.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nFactor these out into a reusable script for downloading apache tarballs. It should contain hard coded apache mirrors and retry when connections fail",
