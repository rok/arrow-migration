Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-9665 (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7913) added amongst other things a `head` method for Dataset in R:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/586c060c8b1851f1077911fae6d02a10ed83e7fb/r/src/dataset.cpp#L266-L282\r\n\r\nIt might be nice to move this to C++ and expose it on the python side as well (and since it's written already in C++ on the R side, it should be relatively straightforward to port I assume)",
