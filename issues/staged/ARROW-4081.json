Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf you create an empty array and use the `Sum` methods in the math package for the Go version, they will panic with an `index out of range` error.\r\n\r\nThe reproducers can be found in this file: <https://github.com/influxdata/flux/blob/6ddfc0f235f91fa29562e7163ab9858f3d08cc62/arrow/arrow_test.go>\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you remove the `Skip`, the tests will cause a panic. I added them to our repository so we could track when this was fixed and remove our own length checks.",
