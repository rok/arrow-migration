        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13348). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNeither the ISO8601 parser nor the strptime parser support parsing timezone offset strings (e.g. `2017-08-19 12:22:11.802755+00`).\u00a0 These are sometimes emitted by other tools (e.g. Postgresql) and should be supported for compatibility.\u00a0 I think it's acceptable for them to parse to Timestamp(units, \"UTC\") or Timestamp(units, offset) whichever is more convenient.\r\n\r\nThis issue doesn't necessarily require supporting tzdata timezone names (e.g. \"America/Denver\", etc.) and those technically aren't ISO8601 compliant anyways.\r\n\r\nSupport should be added to both the ISO-8601 parser (which should support 00:00, 0000, and 00) and the strptime parser (which should add support for %z).",
