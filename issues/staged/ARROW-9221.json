Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/c9c5f5f2e8e8f5db4141d06b6e1841f0a55d905a/java/memory/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/memory/ArrowBuf.java#L832>\r\n\r\nThis should check/set the buffer's endianness. This came up while debugging an issue in Flight; PutResult#fromProtocol asks Protobuf for the byte buffers that underlie a ByteString, but if the implementation is LiteralByteString, Protobuf has no buffers. So it wraps the underlying byte[], and of course the default endianness is BIG_ENDIAN.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/c9c5f5f2e8e8f5db4141d06b6e1841f0a55d905a/java/flight/flight-core/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/flight/PutResult.java#L81>\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/2b7b7f7f72e3617191972fbafb298cf7ec31e95e/java/core/src/main/java/com/google/protobuf/ByteString.java#L1371>",
