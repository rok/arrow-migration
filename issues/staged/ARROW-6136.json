Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDoPut in Java double-closes the metadata response stream: if the service implementation sends an error down that channel, the Flight implementation will unconditionally try to complete the stream, violating the gRPC semantics (either an error or a completion may be sent, never both).",
