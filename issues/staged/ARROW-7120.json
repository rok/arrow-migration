Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis should speed up the compilation steps. Although I'm not sure whether we should define it as a \"docker named volume\" or a standard volume mounted from the host. The former one provides better isolation whereas the latter one makes the integration with GitHub actions and it's cache plugin easier.",
