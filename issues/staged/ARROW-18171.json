Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is related to pyarrow.\r\n\r\nRight now, it's possible to append row groups to parquet file as long as the writer is open. Once the writer is closed, it's not possible to append new row group to a parquet file.\u00a0\r\n\r\nthe only option in such situation is to either recreate the file or write multiple files to the dataset.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is possible with fastparquet using _append=True_ parameter. - [API \u2014 fastparquet 0.7.1 documentation ](https://fastparquet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#fastparquet.write)\r\n\r\nFeature to append row groups to existing file can be beneficial in pyarrow as well.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
