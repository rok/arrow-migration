Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince `Iterator<T>` is used as a base class for exported classes and is instantiated in both arrow.dll and arrow_dataset.dll we get multiple definition errors. The solution taken by MSVC's stl implementation in the similar case of `std::function` is type erasure. Since it's not a base class MSVC doesn't force public visibility of its members. ",
