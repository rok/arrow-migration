Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe [spark PR dashboard](https://github.com/databricks/spark-pr-dashboard) (instance at\r\nhttp://spark-prs.appspot.com/ ) provides a useful view of pull requests. Information is retrieved from the github API and persisted to a database for analyses, including classification of pull requests based on which files they modify. The added context provides greater visibility of PRs to the committers interested in reviewing/merging them.",
