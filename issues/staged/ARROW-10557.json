Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis should implement slicing scalar string values of strings arrays with Python semantics with start, stop ,step arguments. This may seem similar to lists, or binary array, but the string length semantics enter into this kernel, which does not need to equal the number of bytes, nor the number of codepoints (accents, etc should be skipped).\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
