Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nError handling looks like it's happening in the wrong place - a comma has been missed in the `select()` but it's wrongly appearing like it's an issue with `across()`.  Can we do something to make this not happen?\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\ndownload.file(\r\n  url = \"https://github.com/djnavarro/arrow-user2022/releases/download/v0.1/nyc-taxi-tiny.zip\",\r\n  destfile = here::here(\"data/nyc-taxi-tiny.zip\")\r\n)\r\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\nopen_dataset(\"data\") %>%\r\n  select(pickup_datetime, pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude ends_with(\"amount\")) %>%\r\n  mutate(across(ends_with(\"amount\"), ~.x * 0.87, .names = \"{.col}_gbp\")) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nError in `across()`:\r\n!
