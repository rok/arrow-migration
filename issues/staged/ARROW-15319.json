Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow ,arrow's c++ Array interface does not allow user to do in place update, it's a read only interface. If we want to update an existing array ,we need to re-create one by ArrayBuilder.\r\nBut some cases like we want to do sort an arrow array or do additional filter to an exsiting filter(i.e. a BooleanArray), we could do a in place update to save the additional allocating, ( for example ,we supply a mutable_raw_values() interface to NumericArray).\r\n\r\nSo want to know the community advice about the possible to add such mutable interace to the Array interface.",
