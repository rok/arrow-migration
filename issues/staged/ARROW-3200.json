Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome work is needed to handle schemas sent separately from their dictionaries, i.e. ARROW-3144. I'm going to punt on implementing support for this in the initial C++ Flight client",

My opinion is that we should make `arrow::DictionaryType` into a virtual interface and define a `MutableDictionary` subclass to permit the Flight client or server to add the dictionary when the message comes across the wire. This will require some refactoring in the IPC code to permit schemas to be decoded while leaving the dictionaries temporarily null"
