        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6437](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6437). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow C++ library now has an S3 filesystem implementation (ARROW-453), and in order to take advantage of that from R, we need to add the `aws-sdk-cpp` dependency to the macOS and Windows toolchains. \r\n\r\nThere is no PKGBUILD for this at https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages, but https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=aws-sdk-cpp-git has one. \r\n\r\nFor macOS, there already is a formula at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/aws-sdk-cpp.rb, maybe that's sufficient?\r\n\r\nOnce that is in place, we can enable `ARROW_S3=ON` in cmake and build with it (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5167/files#diff-b048bf4c1679dce1028fd897a7c43b93R177)\r\n\r\ncc `[~jeroenooms]`",

Shouldn't it be using MinGW's gcc instead?\n- It's likely that CMake is using Visual Studio as a generator, not Makefiles, which would explain the \"make: \\*\\*\\* No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.\" This page might help: https://github.com/tudelft3d/masbcpp/wiki/Building-on-Windows-with-CMake-and-MinGW\n- CMake is probably pre-installed on AppVeyor, so perhaps that version is being used rather than the MinGW-installed one?\n  \n  Also, for the record, here are  the build scripts we're using on conda-forge:\n  https://github.com/conda-forge/aws-sdk-cpp-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/build.sh\n  https://github.com/conda-forge/aws-sdk-cpp-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/bld.bat\n"

See\u00a0<https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-packages/pull/37>\r\n\r\nSo S3 support will have to be flagged based on whether the C++ library is built with ARROW_S3=ON, and that won't be on for Windows.\r\n\r\nI'll try to update the homebrew/autobrew formula though so we can have macOS support."
