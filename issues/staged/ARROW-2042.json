Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nReverts a part of the changes from <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1479>\u00a0concerning the plasma::Create API. It should output a shared pointer to a Buffer instead of a shared pointer to a MutableBuffer. This is needed for <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1445>\u00a0so we can return a CudaBuffer from plasma::Create. It also seems to be more in line with how Buffers are intended to be used and avoids API breakage from 0.8.0 to 0.9.0.",
