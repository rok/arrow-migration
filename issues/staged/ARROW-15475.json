        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15475](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15475). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowing ARROW-14798 we can have this kind of pretty-print output:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nstruct: [\r\n  -- is_valid: all not null\r\n  -- child 0 type: int64\r\n  [0,1,2,3,4,...,45,46,47,48,49]\r\n  -- child 1 type: list<item: string>\r\n  [[\"crown\",\"trunk\",\"roots\"],[\"roots\",\"seeds\"],...,[],[\"crown\"]],\r\n...,\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMHO it would read better as:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nstruct: [\r\n  -- is_valid: all not null\r\n  -- child 0 type: int64\r\n  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]\r\n  -- child 1 type: list<item: string>\r\n  [[\"crown\", \"trunk\", \"roots\"], [\"roots\", \"seeds\"], ..., [], [\"crown\"]],\r\n...,\r\n```\r\n",
