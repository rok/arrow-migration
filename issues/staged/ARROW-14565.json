        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14565](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14565). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis would mirror the behavior of the synchronous task group.\r\nOne could maybe want a task group that recovers from error but we don't have a need for it today and, since the asynchronous task group only has a single status it, the current implementation isn't well suited for that use case anyways.",
