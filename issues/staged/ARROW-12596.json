This would basically be the Table-equivalent of a `drop_nulls` kernel for Array as described in ARROW-1568 ?\r\n\r\nThis is already somewhat possible by calculating the \"is_valid/is_null\" for each column, combining those, and then filtering the table with that. This is what `[~thisisnic]` did in ARROW-12184 for R, and in Python it would look like:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport functools\r\n\r\nmask = functools.reduce(pc.and_, map(pc.is_valid, table.columns))\r\nresult = pc.filter(table, mask)\r\n```"
