        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2701](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2701). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\r\n\r\nI don't see any reason for the MemoryMappedFile not to be resizable, e.g. like it is in Python stdlib. This patch changes the base class of MemoryMappedFile to ResizableBuffer and implements mmap resizing similar to\u00a0[mmap.resize](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/415bc46a78e785f357c8960ae70f18a6b6cccbb6/Modules/mmapmodule.c#L454)\u00a0from python stdlib.\r\n\r\nIf the change is ok, we should probably change the comment [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/tests/test_io.py#L577), too.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDimitri.",
