Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent implementation:\n```Java\npublic boolean copyFromSafe(int inIndex, int outIndex, BitVector from) {\n    if (outIndex >= this.getValueCapacity()) {\n      decrementAllocationMonitor();\n      return false;\n    }\n    copyFrom(inIndex, outIndex, from);\n    return true;\n  }\n```\n\ndoesn't match the expectation from \"safe\" methods. The method should try to re-allocate if it's running out of space instead of returning false",
