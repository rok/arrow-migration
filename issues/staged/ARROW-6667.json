Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nReference cycles appear in two places inside pyarrow.parquet which causes these objects to have much longer lifetimes than necessary:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`_build_nested_path` has a reference cycle because the closured function refers to the parent cell which also refers to the closured function again (objgraph shown in attachment)\r\n\r\n`open_dataset_file` is partialed with self inside the `ParquetFile` class (objgraph shown in attachment).",
