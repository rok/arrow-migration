        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4512](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4512). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have been working on Spark integration with Arrow.\r\n\r\nI realised that there are no ways to use socket as input to use Arrow stream format. For instance,\r\nI want to something like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nconnStream <- socketConnection(port = 9999, blocking = TRUE, open = \"wb\")\r\n\r\nrdf_slices <- # a list of data frames.\r\n\r\nstream_writer <- NULL\r\ntryCatch({\r\n  for (rdf_slice in rdf_slices) {\r\n    batch <- record_batch(rdf_slice)\r\n    if (is.null(stream_writer)) {\r\n      stream_writer <- RecordBatchStreamWriter(connStream, batch$schema)  # Here, looks there's no way to use socket.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    stream_writer$write_batch(batch)\r\n  }\r\n},\r\nfinally = {\r\n  if (!is.null(stream_writer)) {\r\n    stream_writer$close()\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise, I cannot find a way to iterate the stream batch by batch\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nRecordBatchStreamReader(connStream)$batches()  # Here, looks there's no way to use socket.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks easily possible in Python side but looks missing in R APIs.",
