Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the default `test` target runs serially while `unittest` arbitrarily uses 4 threads. On many systems that's suboptimal. The environment variable `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL` can be set to run tests in parallel, and we should probably have a good default for it (like the hardware concurrency)\r\n\r\nhttps://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html",
