Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the implementation of the Auth interceptors uses `base64.RawStdEncoding.DecodeString` to decode the content of the hanshake.\r\n\r\nIn Go RawStdEncoding will not uses padding (with '='), trying to authenticate from pyarrow (with `client.authenticate_basic_token(user, password)`) will result in an error like:\r\n> `pyarrow._flight.FlightUnauthenticatedError: gRPC returned unauthenticated error, with message: invalid basic auth encoding: illegal base64 data at input byte XX`\r\nStdEncoding would successfully read the content if RawStdEncoding fails.",
