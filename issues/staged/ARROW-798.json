I would like to move it to the same infrastructure as other projects like Calcite use (they have the website in the main source and only push the rendered version to the Website GIT/SVN). With that we should be able to easily get Markdown documents and API docs rendered and uploaded to arrow.apache.org.\n\nI already had a go to move to https://github.com/apache/apache-website-template but that stalled as the template is quite heavy."

I figure we can have a central documentation landing point, with links into the language-specific documentation: Doxygen for C++, Sphinx for Python, etc."
