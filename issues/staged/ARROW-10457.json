        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10457](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10457). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Spark branch-3.0 is currently failing because this branch has not been updated or patched to use the latest Arrow Java, see https://github.com/ursa-labs/crossbow/actions?query=branch:actions-681-github-test-conda-python-3.7-spark-branch-3.0. The Spark branch-3.0 has already been released and only able to get bug fixes. Instead of patching the Spark build, we should not try to rebuild Spark with the latest Arrow Java, and instead only test against the latest pyarrow. This should work, but might also need a minor Python patch.",
