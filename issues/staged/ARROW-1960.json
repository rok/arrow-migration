Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo work around some ABI incompatibility issues with libstdc++ (TF is using a newer compiler), we should consider importing tensorflow first if it is available before loading Arrow's shared libraries built with the manylinux1 toolchain. See discussion in\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/1450\r\n\r\nOne question is whether TensorFlow's symbols will clash with Arrow's in some way that might impact its functioning.",

We could perhaps contemplate using a newer compiler (or the same one as TF) for our wheels. We've experienced some other build-related issues (e.g. the Turbodbc stuff on Fedora, have to dig up the issue) so these could also be resolved by using a newer compiler"

I just opened a PR with that approach: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1464 Sadly, in its current state, it does not build."
