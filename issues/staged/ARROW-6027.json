        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6027](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6027). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi all,\r\n\r\nI seem to be running into an issue when building Apache Arrow for Windows. It fails to build boost; in the CMake output it says\r\n```java\n\r\nCMake Error at D:/Staging/arrow/cpp/release64/boost_ep-prefix/src/boost_ep-stamp/boost_ep-configure-Release.cmake:49 (message):\r\n    Command failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application\r\n\r\n    './bootstrap.sh' '--prefix=D:/Staging/arrow/cpp/release64/boost_ep-prefix/src/boost_ep' '--with-libraries=filesystem,regex,system'\r\n```\r\nI've been\u00a0trying to address this issue, and am currently investigating using a pre-build Boost library as a workaround, but the expectation is that this should work out of the box. I have attached logs demonstrating this behaviour. The initial step of running CMake for Windows 64 is fine, but the actual build step is what fails, and the boost_ep-configure-\\*.log files are empty so there is nothing there to give an idea of what's going on.\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen building Apache Arrow 0.14.x, build should work out of the box when VS 2015 build tools are present and the environment is configured with vcvarsall for the appropriate architecture.\r\n## Observed Behaviour\r\n\r\nBuild fails with error:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nCommand failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application\r\n\r\n    './bootstrap.sh' '--prefix=D:/Staging/arrow/cpp/release64/boost_ep-prefix/src/boost_ep' '--with-libraries=filesystem,regex,system'\n```\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Sync to Maintenance 0.14.x with 'git clone -b maint-0.14.x <https://github.com/apache/arrow.git'>\n1. Following the instructions at <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/cpp.rst>:\n   1. Create a 'build' directory from which to run CMake and generate the appropriate build files.\n   1. Run \"%VS140COMNTOOLS%..\\..\\VC\\vcvarsall.bat\" amd64\n   1. From within the build directory, run \"cmake .. -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64\" -DARROW_BUILD_TESTS=ON\"\n      1. Alternatively, if running Ninja, run \"cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=\"cl.exe\" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=\"cl.exe\" -DARROW_BUILD_TESTS=ON\"\n   1. Observe error.\n      \n      Thanks,\n       ~Jon",

I'll keep an eye out. Is there a rough ETA for that improvement? I looked into the GitHub and the most recent Travis run failed on the `travis-lint.sh` script, which from a cursory reading doesn't seem closely related.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n~Jon"
