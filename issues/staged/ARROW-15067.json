Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere should be one span for each \"read batch\" and one scan for each \"read file\".  The batch spans should be children of the file span.\r\n\r\nIf possible it would be nice if the \"read file\" spans were children of the exec plan when the scanner is being used as a source node.  I'm not sure if this is doable though since the scanner is often used outside the exec plan.",

(That way you could link it up to a Flight span or something too.) You'd have to manually inject it to spans started in the scanner, though. (~2 lines of code or so for each span)"
