        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4016](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4016). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[This issue was discovered during internal testing in Dremio in the java layer]\r\n\r\nI noticed that the LIKE operator is not behaving as it should per SQL standard. Notably it seems to consider \\`.` as a wildcard in some occasions:\r\n\r\n```sql\n\r\nSELECT A FROM (VALUES('abcde'), ('abc.e'), ('abcd'), ('abc.'), ('abc')) TBL(A) WHERE A LIKE 'abc_%'\r\nabcde\r\nabc.e\r\nabcd\r\nabc.\r\nabc \r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\n\r\nSELECT A FROM (VALUES('abcde'), ('abc.e'), ('abcd'), ('abc.'), ('abc')) TBL(A) WHERE A LIKE 'abc.%'\r\nabcde\r\nabc.e\r\nabcd\r\nabc.\r\nabc \r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\n\r\nSELECT A FROM (VALUES('abcde'), ('abc.e'), ('abcd'), ('abc.'), ('abc')) TBL(A) WHERE A LIKE 'abc_'\r\n(no result)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```sql\n\r\nSELECT A FROM (VALUES('abcde'), ('abc.e'), ('abcd'), ('abc.'), ('abc')) TBL(A) WHERE A LIKE 'abc.'\r\n(no result)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBased on code review it seemed that same issue may be present in Gandiva. This bug is to verify & fix it in Gandiva as well.",
