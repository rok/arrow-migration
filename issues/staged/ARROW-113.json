Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeveral of TestValueVector tests fail if JVM is unable to allocate 2GB of memory (value of BaseValueVector#MAX_ALLOCATION_SIZE).\n\nThis is not common for JVM to have that much memory by default, and is probably overkill for tests, maybe making this limit configurable so it can be lowered during tests sounds a good compromise.",
