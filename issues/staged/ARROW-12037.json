Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nProposal doc: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bCP_tjVRLJyOrMBOezSFNpF0hwPa1ZS_qMWv1uvtS4/edit?usp=sharing>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSummary from the doc:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a particularly messy aspect of most SQL implementations, so let\u2019s settle on some terms first:\r\n \\* Schema: a collection of named tables\r\n \\* Catalog: a collection of named schemas (also known as a database)\r\n\r\nThis doc will attempt to describe a standards-compliant implementation for DataFusion, using Postgres\u2019 design decisions as a guide where the standard is not prescriptive (due to our adoption of its query dialect).\r\n\r\nAs an example of how this works in practice, given a default catalog of \u201cdb\u201d and a default schema of \u201cpublic\u201d, all these table references would be equivalent:\r\n \\* db.public.my_table\r\n \\* public.my_table\r\n \\* my_table",
