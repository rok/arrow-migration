Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a follow up of ARROW-8227. It aims to unify simd header files and simplify code.\r\nCurrently, sse header files are included in sse_util.h, neon header files in neon_util.h and avx header files included directly in c source file.  sse_util.h/neon_util.h also contain crc code which is not used by  cpp files #include them.\r\nIt may be better to put all simd header files in a single simd.h, and move crc code to where they are used.",
