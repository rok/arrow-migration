        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14303](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14303). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMetadata values are being duplicated in the Parquet file footer \u2014 we should either only store them in ARROW:schema or the Parquet schema metadata. Removing them from the Parquet schema metadata may break applications that are expecting that metadata to be there when serialized from Arrow, so dropping the keys from ARROW:schema is probably a safer choice",
