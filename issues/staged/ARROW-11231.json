Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a result of ARROW-11009/ARROW-11049/etc. it is now possible to switch allocators at runtime.\u00a0 Previously only one allocator was compiled into the released builds (e.g. the PYPI version of pyarrow only included jemalloc on Linux and mimalloc on Windows).\u00a0 It might now make sense to compile both mimalloc and jemalloc on Linux builds to allow the user to switch out to the appropriate allocator at runtime if they need to.",
