Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are a number of functions which are not intended to be exported (for example, they are defined in a `.cc` file) but are not marked `static inline` or declared in an anoymous namespace. This can lead to surprising link errors. Existing private functions should be marked appropriately, and ideally a linter could be assembled to ensure new ones are not added without appropriate markings.",
