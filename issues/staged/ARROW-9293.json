Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile working on ARROW-3308, I noticed that write_feather has a chunk_size argument, which by default will write batches of 64k rows into the file. In principle, a chunking strategy like this would prevent the need to bump up to large_utf8 when ingesting a large character vector because you'd end up with many chunks that each fit into a regular utf8 type. However, the way the function works, the data.frame is converted to a Table with all ChunkedArrays containing a single chunk first, which is where the large_utf8 type gets set. But if Table$create() could be instructed to make multiple chunks, this would be resolved.",

We need some way to be able to express \"ingest that range of elements from x\". The Chunker class, at least in its current form does not help.\u00a0"
