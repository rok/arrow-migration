Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe cancellation scheme that was checked in by ARROW-12895 seems to only work properly when a Github Actions workflow is triggered by a \"pull_request\" or \"push\" event, but not \"pull_request_target\", as the group key ```Java\n${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.workflow }}\n``` ends up as ```Java\napache/arrow-refs/heads/master-Dev PR\n```.",
