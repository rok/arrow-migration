Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOne of the Flight tests is flaky on Windows, as it appears gRPC doesn't always return us the address of the connected client. We can just disable this part of the test since it's really testing gRPC.",
