Should be fixed before 0.3 release",

It seems like the introduction of new date/time types has caused old schemas to break. Basically, the default units should be the same as the non-unit behavior. In the case of Date that was MILLISECONDS. However, the default is now DAY (0). Seems like the flatbuf should be reordered so that 0 corresponds to MILLISECONDS."
