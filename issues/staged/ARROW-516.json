Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm so close to getting pyarrow installed but I'm getting this error when building extensions:\n\n```Java\npython setup.py build_ext --with-parquet --build-type=release install\n\n...\n\nUsing ld linker\n-- Searching for Python libs in /opt/conda/lib64;/opt/conda/lib;/opt/conda/lib/python3.5/config-3.5m\n-- Looking for python3.5m\n-- Found Python lib /opt/conda/lib/libpython3.5m.so\n-- Searching for Python libs in /opt/conda/lib64;/opt/conda/lib;/opt/conda/lib/python3.5/config-3.5m\n-- Looking for python3.5m\n-- Found Python lib /opt/conda/lib/libpython3.5m.so\n-- Found the Parquet library: /usr/local/lib/libparquet.so\n-- Found the Arrow core library: /usr/local/lib/libarrow.so\n-- Found the Arrow IO library: /usr/local/lib/libarrow_io.so\n-- Found the Arrow IPC library: /usr/local/lib/libarrow_ipc.so\n-- Added shared library dependency arrow: /usr/local/lib/libarrow.so\n-- Added shared library dependency arrow_io: /usr/local/lib/libarrow_io.so\n-- Added shared library dependency arrow_ipc: /usr/local/lib/libarrow_ipc.so\n-- Added shared library dependency python: /opt/conda/lib/libpython3.5m.so\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:434 (message):\n  Unable to locate Parquet libraries\n\n-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!\nSee also \"/tmp/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log\".\nSee also \"/tmp/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log\".\nerror: command 'cmake' failed with exit status 1\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed since it finds the parquet library prior to raising an error that it cant find it.   Any suggestions or is there other information I need to provide?",

Just realised that you have a different problem: Your parquet installation is done without the PARQUET_ARROW support compiled in. You need to add `-DPARQUET_ARROW=ON`\u00a0to your parquet cmake call on installation."
