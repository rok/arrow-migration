Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-14941 we have support for the duration type; however, there is no binding for `lubridate::duration()` or `as.difftime()` available in dplyr evaluation that could create these objects. I'm actually not sure if we should bind `lubridate::duration` since it returns a custom S4 class that's identical in function to base R's difftime.",
