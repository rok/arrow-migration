        "title": "[R] Fix CSV timestamp_parsers test on R-devel",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10270](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10270). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nApparently there is a change in the development version of R with respect to timezone handling. I suspect it is this: https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/doc/NEWS.Rd#L296-L300\r\n\r\nIt causes this failure:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n\u2500\u2500 1. Failure: read_csv_arrow() can read timestamps (@test-csv.R#216)  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n`tbl` not equal to `df`.\r\nComponent \"time\": 'tzone' attributes are inconsistent ('UTC' and '')\r\n\r\n\u2500\u2500 2. Failure: read_csv_arrow() can read timestamps (@test-csv.R#219)  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n`tbl` not equal to `df`.\r\nComponent \"time\": 'tzone' attributes are inconsistent ('UTC' and '')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis needs to be fixed for the CRAN release because they check on the devel version. But it doesn't need to block the 2.0 release candidate because I can (at minimum) skip these tests before submitting to CRAN (FYI `[~kszucs]`)\r\n\r\nI'll also add a CI job to test on R-devel. I just removed 2 R jobs so we can afford to add one back.\r\n\r\ncc `[~romainfrancois]`",
