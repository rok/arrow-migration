Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-8919, a literal in an Expression may cause unnecessary implicit casting of a column. For example `equal(field_ref(\"i8\"), literal(1))` will cause column i8 to be promoted to the type of the literal (int32) for comparison. Since we have access to the literal value at bind time we could examine `1` and determine that it can safely be \\*de\\*moted to int8, which produces a semantically equivalent and more performant filter.\r\n\r\n",
