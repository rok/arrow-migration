Therefore we can pass (without any complaint) all sorts of arguments that do not make sense since neither `write_dataset()`, nor the downstream functions it passes the `...` to seem to check them.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can run the line below without any complaint. The problematic argument never gets evaluated.\r\n```R\n\r\ntd <- tempfile()\r\ndir.create(td)\r\nwrite_dataset(iris, td, format = \"feather\", arg_that_doesnt_make_sense = \"blah-blah\")\r\n```"
