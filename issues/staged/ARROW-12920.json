Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current approach has two problems.\u00a0 First, it forces the stream to buffer one which breaks cache coherency.\u00a0 Second, it breaks the scanner as it is today.\u00a0 An empty file would emit zero batches and the resequencer would see it as a skip in the fragment index and fail.",
