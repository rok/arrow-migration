Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[CeilTemporal, FloorTemporal, RoundTemporal](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_temporal_unary.cc#L728-L980) kernels could probably be templated in a clean way. They also execute a switch statement for every call instead of creating an operator at kernel call time and only running that.",
