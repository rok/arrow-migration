        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13548](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13548). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd a kernel to compute the number of years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, (micro/milli/nano)seconds, or quarters between two timestamps. \r\n\r\nThis should act like SQL's DATEDIFF ([SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datediff-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)). Pandas doesn't have a convenient equivalent except in the case of days (pd.Timedelta.days) but it can be [calculated using Timestamp.to_period](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54171674/calculating-the-amount-of-full-months-between-two-dates).\r\n\r\nWe have hinnant's date library vendored and this should hopefully be implementable with that.",

I saw that postgres calls it EXTRACT which can operate on an interval, but it behaves differently than what I expected; let me edit things to clarify."

            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13548?focusedCommentId=17403354) by Ian Cook (icook):*\nNote regarding the R bindings: I don't think any existing R functions map onto the functions added here, at least not in a straightforward way. The functions added here take a start timestamp and an end timestamp, and they compute how many time unit boundaries are crossed between the two timestamps.\r\n\r\nIn base R and various R packages like clock and lubridate, when the difference between two dates is computed, the result is typically a difftime / period / duration object that stores only the amount of time that elapsed. These objects _do not_\u00a0specify when the period started/ended. The functions that return the number of years/months/days/hours/etc. in a difftime / period / duration are unary and do not work by counting how many time unit boundaries were crossed.\r\n\r\nHowever, lubridate also includes a class called\u00a0[Interval](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/Interval-class.html)\u00a0that\u00a0_does_ store when the period started:\r\n> Interval is an S4 class that extends the Timespan class. An Interval object records one or more spans of time. Intervals record these timespans as a sequence of seconds that begin at a specified date. Since intervals are anchored to a precise moment of time, they can accurately be converted to Period or Duration class objects. This is because we can observe the length in seconds of each period that begins on a specific date. Contrast this to a generalized period, which may not have a consistent length in seconds (e.g. the number of seconds in a year will change if it is a leap year).\r\nHowever there are no functions in lubridate that take an Interval and return the number of\u00a0time unit boundaries that were crossed in that Interval."
