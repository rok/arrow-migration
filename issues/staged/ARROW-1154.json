        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1154](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1154). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a bunch of utility code in parquet-cpp that would have a better home in arrow/util, and make it easier to implement features down the road such as those in ARROW-300. We also need some of these code for computing dictionary encoding in Arrow. \n\nFrom files in parquet/util:\n\n  - bit-stream-utils.inline.h\n  - bit-stream-utils.h\n  - bit-util.h\n  - bpacking.h\n  - bit-util-test.cc\n  - compiler-util.h\n  - cpu-info.h/cc\n  - hash-util.h\n  - rle-encoding.h\n  - rle-test.cc\n  - sse-util.h",
