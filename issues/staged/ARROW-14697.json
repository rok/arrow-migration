Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now, we return the schema, but it would be better if we returned the `head` of the tabular object so that people could see what they are interacting with.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to get a _deterministic_ `head` here, just some idea of what's there.",
