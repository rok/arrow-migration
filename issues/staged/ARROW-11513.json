See [stringr vignette](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html)"

I believe the only practical result of handling those arguments would be to detect conditions that R doesn't support when they are `FALSE` and throw various errors when they're set to `FALSE`. Since they both default to `FALSE`, I suspect this would be more annoying than valuable.\n"
