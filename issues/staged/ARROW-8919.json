Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have \"DispatchExact\" which requires an exact match of input types. \"DispatchBest\" would permit kernel selection with implicit casts required. Since multiple kernels may be valid when allowing implicit casts, we will need to break ties by estimating the \"cost\" of the implicit casts. For example, casting int8 to int32 is \"less expensive\" than implicitly casting to int64",
