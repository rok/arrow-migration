        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11732](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11732). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are two styles of encoding nulls in dictionaries (masked or encoded).\u00a0 In compute:: DictionaryEncode this is controlled by an option.\u00a0 Today, if you pass a dictionary into DictionaryEncode it is a no-op.\r\n\r\nInstead it should check to see if the dictionary is properly encoded (this is easily checked in constant time) according to the requested null encoding scheme and, if not, it should convert it.\r\n\r\nThe default NullEncodingBehavior should also change to EXISTING_OR_ENCODE or a second option should be added so that this doesn't change existing behavior.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done then partition.cc could be improved.\u00a0 It currently requires dictionaries use \"encoded nulls\" and, if a dictionary is passed in that uses \"masked nulls\" then it uncodes and re-encodes the dictionary which is a potentially costly operation.\u00a0 This could be fixed to use the conversion.",
