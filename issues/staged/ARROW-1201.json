Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `type` member is `NULL` if you construct these types in the standard Python way, which causes a core dump when trying to inspect the type. I think the best we can do here is raise an exception indicating that the type isn't properly initialized and that these types aren't really meant for users to use directly.\n\nIt might also be prudent to remove these from the toplevel `pyarrow/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py` so that they aren't visible alongside the public API.",
