Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSteps to reproduce from a fresh clone of Arrow:\r\n\r\nmkdir cpp/debug\r\ncd cpp/debug\r\ncmake .. -DARROW_PLASMA=on\r\nmake -j8 unittest\r\n\r\nclient_tests may then fail due to the store executable not being created. The first time I reproduced the issue the test did fail, but the test passed on subsequent reproductions of this issue. Regardless, if you look in cpp/debug/debug, there is no plasma store executable. If you then call make, the store executable is generated in that directory.",

Quite possibly, the `unittest` target needs additional dependencies."
