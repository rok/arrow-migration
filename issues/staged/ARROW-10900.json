        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10900](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10900). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the TableScan logical plan is quite complex. It can either reference a provider or a table name that is registered to the context.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about linking the logical plan to the TableProvider directly upon parsing of the SQL. This allows to simplify greatly the code and also makes the TableScan plan easier to use by external query plan manipulations.",
