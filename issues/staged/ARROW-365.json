Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently you can convert from a Pandas Series to an Arrow Array but you can then only convert this back to a Series again only by wrapping it into a Column structure. We should provide a method that can directly convert an array to a series.",
