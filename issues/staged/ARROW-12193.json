Users need to click download link in the page. It's inconvenient. We can't use `wget` or `curl` with the URL in our install page.\r\n\r\nWe can use https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua?action=download&filename=arrow/arrow-3.0.0/apache-arrow-3.0.0.tar.gz with `wget` or `curl`:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nwget --content-disposition https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua?action=download&filename=arrow/arrow-3.0.0/apache-arrow-3.0.0.tar.gz\r\ncurl -L -O https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua?action=download&filename=arrow/arrow-3.0.0/apache-arrow-3.0.0.tar.gz\r\n```",
