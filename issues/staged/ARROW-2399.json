Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrays should be immutable, but we have a `set` method on Buffer<T> that should not be there.\r\n\r\nThis is only used from the Bitmap struct. Perhaps Bitmap should maintain its own memory instead and not use Buffer?",
