Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we duplicate the component information to the summary, we have a number of conventions about these, let's add them to the documentation around ~  https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/contributing.html#tips-for-using-jira to give people submitting a chance at getting this right:\r\n\r\nFor the components:\r\n- Continuous Integration \u2014 summary: [CI]\n- Developer Tools \u2014 summary: [Dev]\n- Documentation \u2014 summary: [Docs]\n  \n  All others should be the same for components and summary (e.g. component: Python summary: [Python])\n  \n",
