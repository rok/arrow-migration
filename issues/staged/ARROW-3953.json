Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPandas deprecated the `MultiIndex.labels` in favor of `MultiIndex.codes` (<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/23752).> In the pandas parquet/feather tests, we are now seeing warnings about this (and I assume there will be warnings as well in pyarrow tests if running on pandas master).",
