Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWrapping  raw or smart pointer parameters and other declarations with `gsl::not_null` will assert they are not null. The check is dropped for release builds.\r\n\r\nStatus is tagged with ARROW_MUST_USE_RESULT which emits warnings when a Status might be ignored if compiling with clang, but Result<> should probably be tagged with this too",
