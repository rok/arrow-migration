        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12767](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12767). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLots of Flight methods have streaming interfaces, but are implemented synchronously, either on the server side, on the client side, or in the respective Python bindings. This somewhat limits their usefulness, though, the core 'expensive' operations (DoGet et al) are truly streaming which is what matters.",
