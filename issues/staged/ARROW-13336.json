Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRunning `make clean` in the docs directory doesn't get rid of the content generated in the `generated` directory. That means that if any file was removed (and thus won't be generated anymore) it would still end up being included in the documentation because \"not generating it\" doesn't mean \"deleting the already generated one\".\r\n\r\nBest case that can lead to errors when generating the docs, worst case it might generate wrong doc that contains sections that are no longer valid.",
