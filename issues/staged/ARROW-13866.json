Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNot all of the compute kernels available via `list_compute_functions()` are actually available to use in R, as they haven't been hooked up to the relevant Options class in `r/src/compute.cpp`.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe should:\r\n1. Implement all remaining options classes\n1. Go through all the kernels listed by `list_compute_functions()` and check that they have either no options classes to implement or that they have been hooked up to the appropriate options class\n   \n   \u00a0",
