Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn some cases, boost-regex was build with ICU and thus we also need to include {libicui18n.a} in the linking process.\n\nWe may need a cmake check to see if this is necessary.",

We may want to add an ARROW_LINKFLAGS option so this can be dealt with at configuration time"

I switched to gcc 4.9 on the same platform and the error went away. This suggests the issue's root cause was the ABI conflict (boost from conda-forge, built with gcc 4.8.x from RedHat devtoolset) \u2013 I am not sure this is something we can \"fix\" in Arrow other than providing documentation in case users run into it"
