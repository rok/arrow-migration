Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed that `Writable` is also misspelled. This would spare the user many usages of `reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(...)`, and also will not cause any explicit API breakage (except where users have overridden the virtual function)",
