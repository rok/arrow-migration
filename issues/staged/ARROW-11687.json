Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFound an interesting defect where the final partition of the `RepartitionExec::execute` thread spawner was consistently not being spawned via `tokio::spawn`. This meant that `RepartitionStream::poll_next` was sitting waiting forever for data that never arrived.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a race condition where the `JoinHandle` was not being `await`ed and something strange going on with the internals of tokio like lazy evaluation?",
