        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16751](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16751). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nContext: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13244#discussion_r889780669>\r\n\r\n`target_include_directories()` in cmake 3.10 or earlier doesn't support `INTERFACE` against `IMPORTED` target, so we have to check cmake version like below:\r\n```java\n\r\nif(CMAKE_VERSION VERSION_LESS 3.11)\r\n  set_target_properties(xsimd PROPERTIES INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\r\n                                         \"${XSIMD_INCLUDE_DIR}\")\r\nelse()\r\n  target_include_directories(xsimd INTERFACE \"${XSIMD_INCLUDE_DIR}\")\r\nendif()\r\n```\r\nAbove code is duplicated for some targets. There are also some targets (e.g. ucx::ucx) missed the check.\r\nWe can add a function `arrow_imported_target_interface_include_directories()` to make it simpler.",

Looks Arrow itself is okay with cmake-3.5 (except the ucx target mentioned in this card). But many third party tools need newer cmake versions, e.g. googletest, grpc."
