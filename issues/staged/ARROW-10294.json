Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUnlike other fixed width vectors, DecimalVectors have some APIs that directly manipulate an ArrowBuf (e.g. \\`void set(int index, int isSet, int start, ArrowBuf buffer)`).\r\n\r\nAfter supporting 64-bit ArrowBufs, we need to adjust such APIs so that they work properly.\u00a0",
