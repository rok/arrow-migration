Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Python wrapper for S3Fs does not accept a `retry_strategy` parameter, but the underlying C++ implementation supports it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPython wrapper's constructor arguments:\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/_s3fs.pyx#L181>\r\n\u00a0\r\nC++ base: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.cc#L729>\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe result is that Python users of S3Fs always default to the legacy retry strategy, which is very limited.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSuggested fix is to allow the Python wrapper to specify a retry strategy to be passed through to the wrapped C++ implementation.",

As a C++/Arrow novice, I am unsure what best practices/codebase conventions I may have missed here; very much open to feedback."
