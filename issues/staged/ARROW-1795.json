        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1795](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1795). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncase 1.say, we have total free memory 8 G , we have input 5G data, then comes another 6G data, \r\nif we choose to evict space 6G , it will throw exception saying that\r\nno object can be free. This is because we didn't count the 3G remaining free\r\nspace .If we count this remaining 3G , we need to ask only 3G,thus\r\nwe can evict the 5G data and we are still alive . \r\n\r\ncase 2. another situation is :  if we have free memory 10G , we input 1.5G data ,then comes another\r\n9G data , if we use  10\\*20% = 2G data to evict ,then we will crash . In this situation we need to \r\nuse 9+1.5-10 = 0.5G data to evict  \r\n\r\n",
