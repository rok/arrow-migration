Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyarrow freezes if you set chunk_size=0 (e.g. if you forget to account for short data when setting chunk size as a function of table length, see example).\n\nWould expect either to handle gracefully (e.g. revert to behaviour chunk_size=None) or to throw error.\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pyarrow as pa\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\ncols = 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'\nrow = np.arange(4)\ndata = pd.DataFrame([row], columns=cols)\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(data.reset_index(), timestamps_to_ms=True)\npq.write_table(table, 'test.pq', chunk_size=int(len(data) / 4))\n```",
