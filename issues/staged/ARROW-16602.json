        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16602). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe use local \"git merge\" to merge a pull request in `dev/merge_arrow_pr.py`.\r\n\r\nIf we use \"git merge\" to merge a pull request, GitHub's Web UI shows \"Closed\" mark not \"Merged\" mark in a pull request page. This sometimes confuses new contributors. \"Why was my pull request closed without merging?\" See https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12004#issuecomment-1031619771 for example.\r\n\r\nIf we use GitHub API https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#merge-a-pull-request to merge a pull request, GitHub's Web UI shows \"Merged\" mark not \"Closed\" mark. See https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13180 for example. I used GitHub API to merge the pull request.\r\n\r\nAnd we don't need to create a local branch on local repository to merge a pull request. But we must specify `ARROW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to run `dev/merge_arrow_pr.py`.",
