Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe cast kernels currently do not take explicit options, but instead convert overflows and invalid uft8 to nulls. We can create options that customise the behaviour, similarly to CastOptions in CPP (<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/cast.h#L38>)",
