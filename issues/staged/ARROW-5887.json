        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5887](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5887). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen ArrowStreamWriter is writing a\u00a0`RecordBatch`\u00a0with\u00a0`null`s in it, it is mixing up the column's\u00a0`NullCount`.\r\n\r\nYou can see here:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/90affbd2c41e80aa8c3fac1e4dbff60aafb415d3/csharp/src/Apache.Arrow/Ipc/ArrowStreamWriter.cs#L195-L200>\r\n\r\nIt is writing the fields from\u00a0`0`\u00a0~~>\u00a0`fieldCount`\u00a0order. But then\u00a0[lower](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/90affbd2c41e80aa8c3fac1e4dbff60aafb415d3/csharp/src/Apache.Arrow/Ipc/ArrowStreamWriter.cs#L216-L220), it is writing the fields from\u00a0`fieldCount`\u00a0~~>\u00a0`0`.\r\n\r\nLooking at the\u00a0[Java implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/7b2d68570b4336308c52081a0349675e488caf11/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/ipc/message/FBSerializables.java#L36-L44)\u00a0it says\r\n> // struct vectors have to be created in reverse order\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA simple test of roundtripping the following RecordBatch shows the issue:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nvar result = new RecordBatch(\r\nnew Schema.Builder()\r\n.Field(f => f.Name(\"age\").DataType(Int32Type.Default))\r\n.Field(f => f.Name(\"CharCount\").DataType(Int32Type.Default))\r\n.Build(),\r\nnew IArrowArray[]\r\n{\r\nnew Int32Array(\r\nnew ArrowBuffer.Builder<int>().Append(0).Build(),\r\nnew ArrowBuffer.Builder<byte>().Append(0).Build(),\r\nlength: 1,\r\nnullCount: 1,\r\noffset: 0),\r\nnew Int32Array(\r\nnew ArrowBuffer.Builder<int>().Append(7).Build(),\r\nArrowBuffer.Empty,\r\nlength: 1,\r\nnullCount: 0,\r\noffset: 0)\r\n},\r\nlength: 1);\r\n```\r\nHere, the \"age\" column should have a `null` in it. However, when you write and read this RecordBatch back, you see that the \"CharCount\" column has `NullCount` == 1 and \"age\" column has `NullCount` == 0.",
