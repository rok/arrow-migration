        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10199](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10199). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nVersion of Parquet released to docs.rs & crates.io has debug prints in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/886d87bdea78ce80e39a4b5b6fd6ca6042474c5f/rust/parquet/src/column/writer.rs#L60>. They were pretty hard to track down, so I suggest considering logging create in the future. When is the new version going to be released? Is there some stable schedule I can expect?\r\n\r\nIs it recommended to use the current snapshot straight from github instead of crates.io?",
