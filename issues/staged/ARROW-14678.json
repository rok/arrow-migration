Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCMake presets provide the most commonly used combinations of build options in a simple JSON that can be invoked using the cmake command in the following ways.\r\n\r\ncmake --list-presets .. // To check the list of build combinations available\r\n\r\ncmake --preset <chosen-preset-name> .. // creates a build folder with preset name and puts all relevant files under it.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample preset file I have been using for local development, but it is very limited. Any suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nplease do note that presets doesn't take care of dependency, just the build options when there are a lot.",
