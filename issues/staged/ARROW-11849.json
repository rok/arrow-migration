Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe development version of roxygen2 supports a new tag `@examplesIf`\u00a0to include examples conditionally:\u00a0<https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/commit/513c9e25262e67e7d3383a0feb51be0ba9b6e21f>\r\n\r\nUse this to remove the feature availability conditionals that are used in some examples, including:\r\n \\* `if (arrow_available()) \\{...\\`}\r\n \\* `if (arrow_with_dataset()) \\{...\\`}\r\n \\* `if (arrow_with_parquet()) \\{...\\`}\r\n \\* `if (arrow_with_s3()) \\{...\\`}\r\n\r\nThis will simplify the examples and avoid giving the misleading suggestion that users need to perform these checks this every time.",

After using `@examplesIf`, switch these examples back to using\u00a0`\\donttest`, or use neither if that works."
