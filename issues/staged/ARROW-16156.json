Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-15818 We get an extra message on package load because most users will not have `-DARROW_ENGINE=ON`. We should add \"engine\" to the list of capabilities that we don't warn about ( https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/R/arrow-package.R#L264-L270 ) and perhaps clarify the message so that it's more obvious why it shows up.\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\n#> See arrow_info() for available features\r\n```",
