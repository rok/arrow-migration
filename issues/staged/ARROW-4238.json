Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLinux package builds are detecting the release and expecting an RC postfixed version number during submit, like `0.12.0-rc1`. The rest of the crossbow tasks are expecting non-rc version numbers, so currently either one or the other works, but not both.",
