Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are updating `PyMongoArrow` to use PyArrow 8.0, and saw the following [failure\\| https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-arrow/runs/7696619223?check_suite_focus=true] when building wheels:\u00a0 \"@rpath/libparquet.800.dylib not found\".\r\n\r\nWe overcame the error by explicitly adding \"parquet\" to the list of libraries returned by `get_libraries`.  I am happy to submit a PR.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
