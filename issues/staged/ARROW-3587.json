        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3587](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3587). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, Arrow seems to have poor serialization support for its own objects.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n \u00a0\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport pyarrow \r\narr = pyarrow.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) \r\npyarrow.serialize(arr)\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 337, in pyarrow.lib.serialize\r\n File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 136, in pyarrow.lib.SerializationContext._serialize_callback\r\n pyarrow.lib.SerializationCallbackError: pyarrow does not know how to serialize objects of type <class 'pyarrow.lib.Int64Array'>.\r\n\r\nI am\u00a0working Ray & modin project, using plasma to store Arrow objects. Lack of direct serialization support harms the performance, so I would like to push a PR to\u00a0fix this problem.\r\nI wonder if it is welcome or is there someone else doing it?",
