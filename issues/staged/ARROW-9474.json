        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9474](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9474). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe open_csv stream does not adjust the inferred column type based on the new data seen in new blocks.\r\n\r\nFor example if a csv has null values in the first few blocks of open_csv reader, the column is inferred as Null type. As PyArrow iterates over blocks and sees\u00a0non null values in that column,\u00a0 it crashes.\r\n\r\nExample Error:\r\n```java\n\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: In CSV column #44: CSV conversion error to null: invalid value '-176400' \n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis problem is resolved if a read_option with a huge block size is passed to the open_csv. But that negates the whole point of having a stream vs. read_csv.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSystem info:\r\n\r\nPyArrow 0.17.1, Mac OS Catalina, Python 3.7.4",

We could perhaps add an option to return record batches with different types.\r\ncc `[~npr]`"
