        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3829](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3829). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the style of NumPy's `__array__`, we should be able to ask inputs to `pa.array`, `pa.Table.from_X`, ... whether they can convert themselves to Arrow objects. This would allow for example to turn objects that hold an Arrow object internally to expose them directly instead of going a conversion path.\r\n\r\nMy current use case involves Pandas `ExtensionArray` instances that internally have Arrow objects and should be reused when we pass the whole `DataFrame` to `pa.Table.from_pandas`.",
