Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAlthough Arrow uses bit-packing for booleans, we reserve `length` bytes in the BooleanBuilder. This should be bits, i.e. only 1/8.",
