Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now we skip Python tests on Windows:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/tests/testthat/test-python.R#L18-L32\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, virtualenv isn't supported by reticulate on Windows (at least I could never get it to work) but conda environments are and there might be other ways to get it to work on the CI system we're using.\r\n\r\nAs `[~jonkeane]` mentioned here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12062#issuecomment-1004105805, we could also test backward compatibility of the pyarrow bridge while we're updating the Python tests.",
