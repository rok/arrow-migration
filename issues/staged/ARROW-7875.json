Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI used\u00a0`JdbcToArrow.sqlToArrow()`\u00a0to create an Arrow file from a SQL result set, and when I read the Arrow file back in PyArrow, the decimal numbers are very small. On the order of E-10.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting is that the values are \"correct\", except the decimal places are shifted over.\r\n\r\nThe Arrow file is enclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's a bug around this.\r\n\r\n(using 0.14.1 of Arrow)",
