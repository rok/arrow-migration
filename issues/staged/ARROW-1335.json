Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`NumericArray<T>::raw_values` accounts for offset, while `PrimitiveArray::raw_values` does not. This seems likely to lead to shooting one's self in the foot. It may be better to remove `PrimitiveArray::raw_values` altogether",
