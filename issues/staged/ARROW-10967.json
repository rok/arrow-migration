Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent state:\r\n \\* Two env vars\u00a0**ARROW_TEST_DATA**\u00a0and **PARQUET_TEST_DATA** are required to be set, for running tests,\u00a0 benchmark.\r\n \\* The major usage likes this: let testdata =\u00a0std::env::var(\"PARQUET_TEST_DATA\").expect(\"PARQUET_TEST_DATA not defined\");\u00a0\r\n \\* There already exist some codes that tried to assembly the test data directories by appending relative dir to **current dir** of current running process.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo it would be better if add several public utility functions for getting test data dir. Basic design is:\r\n\r\nIf env is defined\u00a0 and the value points to existing dir, then we get it;\r\n\r\nElse try getting the data dir based on: current dir, default relative dir, etc.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
