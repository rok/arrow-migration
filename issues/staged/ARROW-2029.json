        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2029](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2029). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOf all the `NativeFile` methods, `tell` is the only one that doesn't check if the file is still open before running. This can lead to crashes when using hdfs:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> h = pa.hdfs.connect()\r\n18/01/24 22:31:35 WARN util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\r\n18/01/24 22:31:36 WARN shortcircuit.DomainSocketFactory: The short-circuit local reads feature cannot be used because libhadoop cannot be loaded.\r\n>>> with h.open(\"/tmp/test.txt\", mode='wb') as f:\r\n...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pass\r\n...\r\n>>> f.tell()\r\n#\r\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\r\n#\r\n#\u00a0 SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f52ccb6733d, pid=14868, tid=0x00007f52de2b9700\r\n#\r\n# JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (8.0_151-b12) (build 1.8.0_151-8u151-b12-0ubuntu0.16.04.2-b12)\r\n# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (25.151-b12 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops)\r\n# Problematic frame:\r\n# V\u00a0 [libjvm.so+0x67c33d]\r\n#\r\n# Failed to write core dump.
