Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13227 Added documentation about the exec plan which is the workflow engine for the streaming execution engine.  Since then we have added a number of nodes (filter, project, hash-join, etc) which each have their own behavior and options.  We should document these nodes and give some examples how the low level C++ API can be used to create query plans.  This would be intended for fairly advanced users.  Most users will probably be getting to the exec plan through some kind of front end.",
