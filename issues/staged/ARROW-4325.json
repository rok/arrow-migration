Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHomebrew maintainers recently removed the arrow recipe, <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/36063>\u00a0because apparently it was failing with recent versions of arrow.\r\n\r\nWe were using the homebrew recipe for installing arrow on macOS during the R package installation, so we would need to fix the issue and re-submit arrow to homebrew.\r\n\r\nThis might not be a huge immediate priority, but it definitely needs to be done before the R package is on CRAN",
