        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13317](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13317). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current documentation for [read_feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.feather.read_feather.html) states the following:\r\n\r\n**use_threads** (_bool__,_ _default True_) \u2013 Whether to parallelize reading using multiple threads.\r\n\r\nif the underlying file uses compression, then multiple threads can still be spawned. The verbiage of the **use_threads** is ambiguous on whether the restriction on multiple threads is only for the conversion from pyarrow to the pandas dataframe vs the reading/decompression of the file itself which might spawn additional threads.\r\n\r\n[set_cpu_count](http://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.set_cpu_count.html#pyarrow.set_cpu_count) might be good to mention as a way to actually limit threads spawned",
