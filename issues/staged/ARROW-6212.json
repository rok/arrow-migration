Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGiven an unsorted vector, we want to get the index of the ith smallest element in the vector. This function is supported by the rank operation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe provide an implementation\u00a0that gets the index with the\u00a0desired rank, without sorting the vector (the vector is left intact), and the implementation takes O( n )\u00a0time, where n is the vector length.",
