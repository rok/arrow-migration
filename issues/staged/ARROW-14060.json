        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14060](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14060). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAn example use case would be registering a type mapper that maps from UUID to a custom extension type or registering an extension type for `complex`.  However, it could be used for builtin types as well (e.g. mapping all `int` to `pa.int8()`)\r\n",

I would suppose this would tap into the generic conversion code for \"sequences\" (list-likes, object dtype numpy arrays, so python_to_arrow.cc (`ConvertPySequence` and not numpy_to_arrow.cc). So that this also works for eg `pa.array([<uuid-object>, ..])`."
