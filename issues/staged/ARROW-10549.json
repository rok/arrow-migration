Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImplement the Dataset API on [Ceph](http://ceph.io). This can be done using Ceph's [librados](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/master/src/include/rados/librados.hpp) C++ API. In addition, the [RADOS SDK](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/architecture/?highlight=objclass-sdk#extending-ceph) can be used for creating an object class for arrow data that allows operations (expressions) to be pushed down. See [corresponding mailing list discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r2a5a693967213b7c6bb49015194ca16afc4d20047805d0e069c2e45c%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E).\r\n\r\n",
