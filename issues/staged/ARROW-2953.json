Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile doing some memory profiling on the store, it became clear that at the moment the metadata of the objects takes up much more space than it should. In particular, for each object:\r\n \\* The object id (20 bytes) is stored three times\r\n \\* The object\u00a0checksum (8 bytes) is stored twice\r\n\r\nWe can therefore significantly reduce the metadata overhead with some refactoring.",
