Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHasher interface was introduce in ARROW-5898 and now have two different implementations (`MurmurHasher and SimpleHasher`) and it could be more in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd currently `ValueVector#hashCode`\u00a0and `DictionaryHashTable`\u00a0only use `SimpleHasher`\u00a0for calculating hashCode. This issue enables them to use different hasher or even user-defined hasher for their own use cases.",
