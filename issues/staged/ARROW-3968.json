        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3968](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3968). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs part of exploring the Arrow C++ implementation, I wrote standalone tool for\u00a0streaming Arrow to a file from CSV, using the new CSV parser implementation from `[~pitrou]`. I realize that Arrow's emphasis is on in-memory representation, as opposed to efficient storage to disk, so I'd love to know if this has any utility for the project. At the very least, it seems like a quick way to get into exploring the format from a something easily inspectable/familiar (i.e., CSV).\r\n\r\nIn either case, I'm making this issue here as a placeholder for an accompanying PR on Github. Also, I think this is my first issue for this project, so please let me know if I should do anything differently.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPR is now available at:\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3136",
