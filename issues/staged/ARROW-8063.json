Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, we only have API docs (https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/dataset.html), but we also need prose docs explaining what the dataset module does with examples.\r\n\r\nThis can also include guidelines on how to use this instead of the ParquetDataset API (depending on how we end up doing ARROW-8039), this aspect is also covered by ARROW-8047",
