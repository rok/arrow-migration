Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFormatting expressions should be doable without the data types.  If data types are provided then the expression literals should still be cast to the appropriate data type as before.\r\n\r\nParsing paths could be doable without the data types (we could infer this) but since we already have PartitioningFactory / FilesystemDatasetFactory for this use case I don't see much advantage in supporting that.",
