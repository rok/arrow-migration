Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA user should be able to sort by some criteria and then write out the dataset in a sorted fashion.  Partitions would not be sorted in any way (they are essentially outer sort keys).  However, the chunks inside a partition should be sorted such that chunk-N comes before chunk-X if N < X.\r\n\r\nAssuming we come up with some kind of mid-plan sorting approach (will likely be needed by window functions) then this should be pretty straightforward to implement efficiently as the dataset writer already assigns chunk ids on a serialized path.",
