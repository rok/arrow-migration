Arrow is not installed, and I tried both `install.packages(\"arrow\")` and the script provided by the Arrow project that contains the `install_arrow()` function.`\r\n\r\n`The installation always fail at some point after lots of compilation with a message`\r\n```java\n\r\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find /home/amit/tmp/Rtmp54dYjQ/R.INSTALL49a67e7832c7/arrow/libarrow/arrow-5.0.0/lib: file format not recognized\n```\r\n`I've tried calling the `install_arrow()` function in the following ways:`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ninstall_arrow(binary = TRUE, minimal = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)\r\ninstall_arrow(binary = FALSE, minimal = TRUE, verbose = TRUE) \n```\r\n`I also try to install the Arrow binaries (using the command in\u00a0[https://arrow.apache.org/install/|``https://arrow.apache.org/install/``]) and then running the above commands again but got the same error.`\r\n\r\n`I'm attaching the log from running the first command above.`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

This could be totally wrong - but your comment about the arrow binary deb packages made me think of it.  To clarify, when you say \"arrow binary deb packages\", are you talking about a system installation of Arrow rather than your R package and associated libraries?"

It's much easier to let the install script in the package handle that than to have a system version as there's more scope for things to go wrong.\r\n\r\nThere's more info in the vignette here: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html\r\n\r\nWhat I'd recommend is uninstalling the system libraries entirely, removing the R package you have installed, and then install again using `install.packages()` - a fresh start on this might sort things out."

I then updated all system packages and all R packages, it seems to be better - `install.packages(\"arrow\")` manage to complete, but complained that it cannot find C++ libraries. I then ran `install_arrowl()` but it failed with the ld error I reported above. Now `arrow_info()` shows\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n> arrow::arrow_info()\r\nArrow package version: 5.0.0\r\nArrow C++ library not available. See https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html for troubleshooting.\r\n```\r\nThe link suggest to set LIBARROW_BINARY=true, I did that and tried `install_arrow()` again, and it again failed. I also tried other combinations for LIBARROW_BINARY and LIBARROW_MINIMAL but it didn't help\r\n\r\nThe workaround I finally found was to copy the arrow installation from the docker container to my laptop R/site-library directory. Both are running the same version of Debian, and that way Arrow is now working on my laptop, with all the capabilities I need. This is not perfect, but for now it solves my practical problem.\r\n\r\nFor now I'll stop trying to solve the problem of installing arrow directly on my system. However, if you want to investigate this further and I can help in some way, I'd be glad to do that.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your efforts,\r\n\r\nAmit\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
