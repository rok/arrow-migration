        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7821). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGandiva supports static literal constants, but doesn't support runtime literal constants (or simply, variables). This means that queries like `x > 1` and `x > 2` are compiled in separate operators. The goal would be to provide something like prepared statement for very simple expression, e.g. ` x > ?`. This way we can pre-generate operators for most basic comparison filters on every type.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that the variables should be stashed in the context pointer as opposed to a new function parameter. This would minimise the implementation impact.",
