There network access during build is restricted because it is impure, so using vendored double-conversion requiring a download is not a favourable solution. When I tried to build against external double-conversion I got the issue described above. There are essentially two issues:\r\n\r\n1. There is a call to ADD_THIRDPARTY_LIB with undefined parameter ${DOUBLE_CONVERSION_STATIC_LIB}\n1. find_package(double-conversion REQUIRED) when built against 3.1.1 creates target called \"double-conversion::double-conversion\" and not \"double-conversion\"\n   \n   The PR on github fixes both issues."
