        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12111](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12111). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow binary format is implemented with Flatbuffers specification files (_\\*.fbs_ in the top-level _format_ directory). The _flatc_ binary is used to generate source files for various implementation languages.\r\n\r\nThe Java build does the generation as part of every build. However, these languages have _flatc-_generated files under source control:\r\n \\* C++\r\n \\* Rust\r\n \\* Javascript\r\n \\* C#\r\n\r\nJava can do this as well, removing the build dependency on _flatc_ (currently provided by an unofficial Maven artifact, not available under Windows). The Java build doc can be updated to reflect this change and document how to generate and check in files when the binary format changes.",
