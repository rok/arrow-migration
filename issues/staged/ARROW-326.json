Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's possible and sometimes useful to use reuse a nested vector that was populated in a previous ComplexWriter. The new ComplexWriter should be aware of the fields that are present in the vector.\n\nAs it is right now, if a particular column were determined to be a specific type (or a union type), but the new writer finds a new type, the original type may be thrown out. What should happen is that the type should be promoted to union (or have a new subtype added to the union field).",
