        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18193](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18193). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are a number of functions that Acero currently implements for decimal types by first casting to float implicitly.  Substrait does not allow for this kind of implicit cast.  If a plan does not have a decimal-native implementation of a function then it should reject the plan.",
