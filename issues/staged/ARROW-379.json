Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of relying on a hardcoded string, it would be better to infer the version number from the SCM. This would get rid of the custom code in the release script (which I'm not sure if it is actually working) and also provide better (i.e. increasing) dev-versions. ",
