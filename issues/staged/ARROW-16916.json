        "title": "[C++] Function docs incorrectly list \"numeric\" as input types for some kernels that only accept floating point",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16916](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16916). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the documentation for compute functions there are some functions that list their input type as \"numeric\" even though these functions only accept floating point types.  I suspect part of the reason for this is that Arrow will automatically cast the input to floating point as needed but the docs should be more clear.\r\n\r\nFor example, sqrt, ceil, floor, and round all list \"Numeric\" for input types even though none of these functions have integer kernels.  `sqrt` also lists \"Numeric\" for output types even though it is impossible to have an integer return from this function.",
