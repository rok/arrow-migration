That way, you never overwrite the existing docs with a new  set of files, potentially leaving older ones (now, ensuring the old ones are deleted when overwriting the docs should also not be hard, of course)"

Until we're publishing old versions of the docs, we should not have commingled versions in the same directories. This will simply require some changes to the docs deployment instructions"
