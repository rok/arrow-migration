Question is if we want to add options to classify NaN as null as well in various places, or R could back `is.na` by a combination of `is_null` and `is_nan` ?"

Database systems and such usually treat `NaN` as something different from `NULL` and it makes sense for the C++ library to work that way. This change should only be made in the R package, because in R, `NaN` is considered an `NA` value."
