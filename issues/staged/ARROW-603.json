Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf the data type in a schema does not match the array `type()` metadata, this passes unchecked. It would be useful to have a function that can check for this, and for this to run automatically in debug builds (i.e. inside a `DCHECK`)",
