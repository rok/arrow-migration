        "title": "[Python] Arrow to Pandas conversion promotes child array to float for NULL values",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10512](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10512). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen converting a nested Arrow array to Pandas, if a child array is an integer type with NULL values, it gets promoted to floating point and NULL values are replaced with NaNs. Since the Pandas conversion for these types results in Python objects, it is not necessary to use NaN and `None` values could be inserted instead. This is the case for ListType, MapType and StructType, etc.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [4]: s = pd.Series([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, None]])\r\n\r\nIn [5]: arr = pa.Array.from_pandas(s)\r\n\r\nIn [6]: arr.type\r\nOut[6]: ListType(list<item: int64>)\r\n\r\nIn [7]: arr.to_pandas()\r\nOut[7]: \r\n0    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\r\n1    [4.0, 5.0, nan]\r\ndtype: object \n```",
