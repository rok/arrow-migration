        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8588). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\r\n\r\nIt appears in\u00a0ARROW-7863 the `driver` param was removed from `hdfs.connect()` function. However, if I understand it correctly,\u00a0ARROW-7863 should only remove `libhdfs3` related tests, not disabling it entirely.\r\n\r\nIf I instantiate `pyarrow.HadoopFileSystem` class directly, it is still able to take in the `driver` param.\r\n\r\nCan the arrow project check whether this change in API is intended?\r\n\r\nAlso, even if it is intended, this is a breaking change and deserves some documentation around it.",

I'd rather prefer removing the `driver='libhdfs'` from `pyarrow.HadoopFileSystem` as well. \r\n\r\nAdditionally we should deprecate the old filesystem classes implemented in `filesystem.py` in favor of the new C++ implementation (which doesn't support libhdfs3 driver).\r\n\r\ncc `[~apitrou]`"
