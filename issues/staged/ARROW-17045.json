        "title": "[C++] Reject trailing slashes on file path",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17045](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17045). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe had several different behaviors when passing in file paths with trailing slashes: LocalFileSystem would return IOError, S3 would trim off the trailing slash, and GCS would keep the trailing slash as part of the file name (later creating confusion as the file would be labelled a \"directory\" in list calls). This PR moves them all to the behavior of LocalFileSystem: return IOError.\r\n\r\nThe R filesystem bindings relied on the behavior provided by S3, so they are now modified to trim the trailing slash before passing down to C++.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the differences in behavior between S3 and GCS:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow.fs\r\nfrom pyarrow.fs import FileSelector\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\n\r\ngcs = pyarrow.fs.GcsFileSystem(\r\n    endpoint_override=\"localhost:9001\",\r\n    scheme=\"http\",\r\n    anonymous=True,\r\n    retry_time_limit=timedelta(seconds=1),\r\n)\r\n\r\ngcs.create_dir(\"py_test\")\r\n\r\n# Writing to test.txt with and without slash produces a file and a directory!?\r\nwith gcs.open_output_stream(\"py_test/test.txt\") as out_stream:\r\n    out_stream.write(b\"Hello world!\")\r\nwith gcs.open_output_stream(\"py_test/test.txt/\") as out_stream:\r\n    out_stream.write(b\"Hello world!\")\r\ngcs.get_file_info(FileSelector(\"py_test\"))\r\n# [<FileInfo for 'py_test/test.txt': type=FileType.File, size=12>, <FileInfo for 'py_test/test.txt': type=FileType.Directory>]\r\n\r\ns3 = pyarrow.fs.S3FileSystem(\r\n    access_key=\"minioadmin\",\r\n    secret_key=\"minioadmin\",\r\n    scheme=\"http\",\r\n    endpoint_override=\"localhost:9000\",\r\n    allow_bucket_creation=True,\r\n    allow_bucket_deletion=True,\r\n)\r\n\r\ns3.create_dir(\"py-test\")\r\n\r\n# Writing to test.txt with and without slash writes to same file\r\nwith s3.open_output_stream(\"py-test/test.txt\") as out_stream:\r\n    out_stream.write(b\"Hello world!\")\r\nwith s3.open_output_stream(\"py-test/test.txt/\") as out_stream:\r\n    out_stream.write(b\"Hello world!\")\r\ns3.get_file_info(FileSelector(\"py-test\"))\r\n# [<FileInfo for 'py-test/test.txt': type=FileType.File, size=12>]\r\n```\r\n",
