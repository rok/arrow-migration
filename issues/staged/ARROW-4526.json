        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4526). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow\u00a0currently has a hard dependency on Netty and exposes this in public APIs. This shouldn't be the case. There could be many allocator\u00a0implementations with Netty\u00a0as one possible option. We should remove hard\u00a0dependency between arrow-vector and Netty, instead creating a\u00a0trivial allocator.\u00a0ArrowBuf should probably expose an <T> T unwrap(Class<T> clazz) method instead to allow inner providers availability without a hard reference. This should also include drastically reducing the number of methods on ArrowBuf as right now it includes every method from\u00a0ByteBuf but many of those are not very useful, appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis work should come after we do the simpler\u00a0ARROW-3191",

Remove all references to Netty from ArrowBuf, BufferAllocator, ReferenceManager.\n1. Move Netty memory manager into a separate module such that the basic allocator does not depend on it.\n1. Move ArrowBuf into the Arrow package.\n   \n   Some other smaller steps may also make sense as you start working on it."

It seems that ARROW-9300 still leaves netty-common as a dependency, but I'm not sure what references it.\u00a0 Also, I'm wondering if the netty allocator is in a different module, and it's only a dependency to arrow-vector in test scope, is it no longer the default allocator?"

Currently, we are still referencing the netty implementation, because it has always been the default option. I think we will switch to the unsafe allocation manager some time in the future, when the timing is right. \r\n\r\nBTW, the reference is done implicitly through refection, to avoid the problem of cyclic dependency."
