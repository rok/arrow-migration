        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13791](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13791). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the datasets user guide has a section about the different partitioning flavors: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/dataset.html#different-partitioning-schemes. However, for the case where the partitioning schema is inferred from the file paths, this only shows the \"short-cut\" way to do this, and not the equivalent explicit method to create a factory object with `ds.Hive/DirectoryPartitioning.discover(..)` call, which allows to specify more options (eg using dictionary types or not, etc).",
