Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt takes 15 seconds in debug mode (probably more with ASAN /  UBSAN /etc.) to run 2 tests that simply iterated through a generated in-memory dataset:\r\n```Java\n\r\n$ ./build-test/debug/arrow-dataset-file-parquet-test \r\nRunning main() from /home/conda/feedstock_root/build_artifacts/gtest_1551008230529/work/googletest/src/gtest_main.cc\r\n[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test case.\r\n[----------] Global test environment set-up.\r\n[----------] 2 tests from TestParquetFileFormat\r\n[ RUN      ] TestParquetFileFormat.ScanRecordBatchReader\r\n[       OK ] TestParquetFileFormat.ScanRecordBatchReader (7338 ms)\r\n[ RUN      ] TestParquetFileFormat.Inspect\r\n[       OK ] TestParquetFileFormat.Inspect (6222 ms)\r\n[----------] 2 tests from TestParquetFileFormat (13560 ms total)\r\n\r\n[----------] Global test environment tear-down\r\n[==========] 2 tests from 1 test case ran. (13560 ms total)\r\n[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless it is stressing something in particular, the number of repetitions or the batch size can probably be reduced dramatically.",
