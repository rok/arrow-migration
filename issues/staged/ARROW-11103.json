Can the community also support the physical plan serialization? Or are there other challenges?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf datafusion does not support serialization, we can only extend it externally via this post: <https://serde.rs/deserialize-struct.html#manually-implementing-deserialize-for-a-struct>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
