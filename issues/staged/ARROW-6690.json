        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6690). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the implementation of HashAggregate in the new physical plan uses the same logic regardless of whether a grouping expression is used.\r\n\r\nFor the case where there is no grouping expression, such as \"SELECT SUM(a) FROM b\" we can use the compute kernels to perform an aggregate operation on each batch rather than iterating over each row and accumulating individual values.\r\n\r\nThis optimization already exists in the original implementation of aggregate queries direct from the logical plan.",
