Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe test::format_batch function does not have wide range of type support (e.g. it doesn't support dictionaries) and its output makes tests hard to read / update, in my opinion. We should consolidate the tests to use `arrow::util::pretty::pretty_format_batches` both to reduce code duplication as well as increase type support\r\n",
