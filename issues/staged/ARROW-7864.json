        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7864](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7864). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAmong the issues:\r\n\r\n- In https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/6435: 0.15 system packages didn't have libarrow_dataset, so if they're installed and you try to install 0.16, pkg-config probably reports that the packages aren't available and it tries to build from source. That's fine except that in the linking step, apparently the system packages are being picked up instead of the static libs we just built, so installation fails (presumably until you either upgrade the system packages or delete them). In general, if we've decided to build/download static libs to match the R package, we should make sure those are the ones that get picked up.\n- Whenever pkg-config does find packages, check the version and make sure it matches the R version, and if not, don't use them because they almost certainly won't work.",

I'll add a check for version mismatch and warn if it doesn't match but I think that's it for now."
