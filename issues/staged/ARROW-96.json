As far as I know doxygen, code comments that should be included in the API docs should have a more \"special\" comment, e.g. `///` or `/** */` (see https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html).\n\n`[~wesmckinn]` I'm happy with any of them. You had some preference if I remember correctly? I would also use the same choice then for parquet-cpp."
