Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n**Umbrella ticket**\r\n\r\nAt the moment `Table.filter` only accepts a mask, and building a mask that actually leads to the rows we care about can be complex and slow in cases where more than one compute function is used to generate the mask. It would be helpful to be able to pass an `Expression` as the argument and get the table filtered by that expression as expressions are easier to understand and reason about than masks.",
