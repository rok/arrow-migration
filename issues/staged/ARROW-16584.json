Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm trying to use Arrow Java (<https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.arrow/arrow-dataset/8.0.0>) to read a parquet file from S3. It fails due to the native library being compiled without S3 support:\r\n```\n\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Got S3 URI but Arrow compiled without S3 support\r\nat org.apache.arrow.dataset.file.JniWrapper.makeFileSystemDatasetFactory(Native Method)\r\nat org.apache.arrow.dataset.file.FileSystemDatasetFactory.createNative(FileSystemDatasetFactory.java:35)\r\nat org.apache.arrow.dataset.file.FileSystemDatasetFactory.<init>(FileSystemDatasetFactory.java:31)\n```",

I can see in the case of C++ there are tests that use Minio (<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs_test.cc>)\r\n\r\nShould I just add a simple test that reads a parquet file from S3 (Minio) under <https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/java/dataset/src/test/java/org/apache/arrow/dataset> ?\u00a0 I don't see any use of docker in tests for Java, should I bring Minio as docker dependency or should I expect Minio executable to be always available?"
