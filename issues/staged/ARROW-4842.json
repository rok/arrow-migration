It seems that this is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nFor `ARROW_WITH_ZSTD`, we should generate `arrow/feature.h` by `configure_file` instead of putting `-DARROW_WITH_ZSTD`. (This will be done by ARROW-4840?)\r\n\r\nFor `ARROW_PARQUET`, users should use `pkg-config --cflags --libs parquet`. If the command returns non-zero, `ARROW_PARQUET` was `OFF`. (This is already done by providing separated `.pc` such as `arrow.pc`, `parquet.pc` and `arrow-orc.pc`.)"
