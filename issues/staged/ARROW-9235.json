        "title": "[R] Support for `connection` class when reading and writing files",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9235](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9235). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have an internal filesystem that we interact with through objects that inherit from the connection class. These files aren't necessarily local, making it slightly more complicated to read and write parquet files, for example.\r\n\r\nFor now, we're generating raw vectors and using that to create the file. For example, to read files\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nReadParquet <- function(filename, ...) {}}\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 file <-file(filename,\"rb\")\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 on.exit(close(file))\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 raw <- readBin(file, \"raw\", FileInfo(filename)$size)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 return(arrow::read_parquet(raw, ...))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd to write,\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nWriteParquet <- function(df, filepath, ...) {\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 stream <- BufferOutputStream$create()\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 write_parquet(df, stream, ...)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 raw <- stream$finish()$data()\r\n   file <- file(filepath, \"wb\")\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 on.exit(close(file)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 writeBin(raw, file)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 return(invisible())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the C++ level, we are interacting with ` R_new_custom_connection` defined here:\r\n <https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/include/R_ext/Connections.h>\r\n\r\nI've been very impressed with how feature-rich arrow is. It would be nice to see this API supported as well.",

Reading and writing from a connection uses a similar API to the current `InputStream` and `OutputStream`, so in theory it's not too bad (with the caveat that connections probably aren't safe to be called from other threads).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/include/R_ext/Connections.h#L91-L94"
