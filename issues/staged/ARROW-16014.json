        "title": "[C++] Create more benchmarks for measuring expression evaluation overhead",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16014](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16014). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a lot of great benchmarks on individual kernels but I don't know if we have enough benchmarks on the function & expression evaluation itself.\r\n\r\nThere are some benchmarks (function_benchmark.cc) which measure this but I would like to get a better sense of a \"bytes per second\" number from the function system for a trivial function (e.g. an identity function that simply returns the values as is).\r\n\r\nIn addition, we should measure overhead for common tasks like preallocation, etc.\r\n\r\nI would also like these benchmarks to be parameterized by batch size.  Being able to run on small batches enables (in theory) better cache utilization.  I suspect that the overhead here may start to become a bottleneck.",

I posted on the user@ mailing list about this, with a relevant repository for reproducing the performance I was seeing [1].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn Weston's response, he noted another post from Wes on the dev@ mailing list that seemed highly relevant [2].
