        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-954](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-954). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor certain build environments, it can be beneficial to have a version of arrow that only depends on boost headers:\n\n- It is less brittle in terms of supporting different build environments than dynamically or statically linked boost libraries; also it might make it easier to integrate with an in-tree boost in the future.\n\n- Especially if dynamically linked boost libraries need to be avoided, but the resulting binary is compiled as a shared library python extension, statically linking boost is not an option (many distributions distribute boost static libraries that were compiled without -fPIC)\n\nWe should therefore have a flag that makes arrow compile with a header-only boost. This comes at the cost of not supporting the HDFS bridge.",
