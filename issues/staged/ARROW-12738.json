This is a red herring and the build problem above is the real issue.",

The compiler used is clang 11, the recipe dependency is llvm 10 but the build fails due to invompatible llvm bitcode: arithmetic_ops.bc: error: Unknown attribute kind (70) (Producer: 'LLVM12.0.0' Reader: 'LLVM 10.0.1')\r\n> I don't where does it get the llvm 12 version though\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10288 also references this."
