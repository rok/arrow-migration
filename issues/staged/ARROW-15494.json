        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15494](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15494). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nClarify wording slightly of \\`pyarrow.dataset.write_dataset()` parameter `existing_data_behavior`\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/a27c55660e575a3987283d5d9e443642db48f215/python/pyarrow/dataset.py#L812-L827>\r\n\r\nProposed wording:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n    existing_data_behavior : 'error' | 'overwrite_or_ignore' | \\\r\n'delete_matching'\r\n        Controls how the dataset will handle data that already exists in\r\n        the destination.  The default behavior ('error') is to raise an error\r\n        if any data exists in the `base_dir` destination.\r\n\r\n        'overwrite_or_ignore' will ignore any existing data and will\r\n        overwrite files with the same name as an output file.  Other\r\n        existing files will be ignored.  This behavior, in combination\r\n        with a unique basename_template for each write, will allow for\r\n        an append workflow.\r\n\r\n        'delete_matching' is useful when you are writing a partitioned\r\n        dataset.  The first time each partition leaf-level directory is \r\n        encountered the entire leaf-level directory will be deleted.  This\r\n        allows you to overwrite old partitions completely.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI.e. clarify that:\r\n- `error` applies to the base_dir level.\n- `delete_matching` applies to the leaf-level directory.",
