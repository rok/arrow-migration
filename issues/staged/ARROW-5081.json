Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn trying to set up a build using system libraries installed to non-default paths, CMake doesn't consistently search user-specified paths for libraries.\r\n\r\nFor instance, FindDoubleConversion.cmake will look only at ${DoubleConversion_ROOT}/libdoubleconversion.so for the shared library, making it impossible to have a directory setup like doubleconversion/lib/**.so + doubleconversion/include. Other Find**.cmake files set PATH_SUFFIXES to also search the lib/ subdirectory; we should do this everywhere.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it seems the various Find\\*.cmake files set PATH_SUFFIXES inconsistently. Some hardcode their own list, others use CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE.",
