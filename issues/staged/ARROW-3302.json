        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3302](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3302). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI installed the dependencies for arrow js today and it took 10 minutes (5 minutes the for the second run) with npm and less than one minute with yarn (I think there is an argument for using yarn instead of npm). Arrow js has 2792 dependencies right now. Installation takes very long but there is also some danger that the library will be hard to maintain in the future with this many dependencies. \r\n",

I knew we had a lot of dependencies but not having done a fresh install in a while, I didn't realize how long that first run could take. It looks like there's probably some low-hanging fruit here, e.g. removing `lint-staged`, which doesn't seem to even be used, drops the total size of node_modules from 445M to 422M. I'll see what else I can find"

Luckily, most of the dependencies are developer only dependencies. Skimming things down will improve the experience for new devs. "
