I would like to be able to run SQL queries against data that is already loaded into memory in a single RecordBatch or an iterator over RecordBatch.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons I want this feature:\r\n1. Ability to call DataFusion via IPC or JNI from Java to run queries\n1. Ability to create benchmarks for the query engine that do not involve disk I/O\n   \n   \u00a0",
