        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18039](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18039). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe MinGW C++ builds on CI currently build in release mode. This is probably because debug builds on Windows are complicated (you must get all the dependencies also compiled in debug mode, AFAIU).\r\n\r\nHowever, we could probably disable optimizations, so as to reduce compilation times.\r\nThe compilation flags are currently as follows:\r\n```Java\n\r\n-- CMAKE_C_FLAGS:  -O2 -DNDEBUG -ftree-vectorize  -Wa,-mbig-obj -Wall -Wno-conversion -Wno-sign-conversion -Wunused-result -fno-semantic-interposition -mxsave -msse4.2 \r\n-- CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:  -Wno-noexcept-type  -fdiagnostics-color=always -O2 -DNDEBUG -ftree-vectorize  -Wa,-mbig-obj -Wall -Wno-conversion -Wno-sign-conversion -Wunused-result -fno-semantic-interposition -mxsave -msse4.2 \r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can pass `-O0`?",
