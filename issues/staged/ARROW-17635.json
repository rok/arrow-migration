        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17635). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs explained in the README below, some files in the conda recipe must be sync'ed with the \"upstream\" conda-forge `arrow-cpp` feedstock:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/a5ecb0ff0774805b0f912e231eaedf42e7194c36/dev/tasks/conda-recipes/README.md\r\n\r\nI'll also note that the \"upstream\" build matrices have become huge and we should only enable a couple of these jobs to avoid blowing up our own CI resources:\r\nhttps://github.com/conda-forge/arrow-cpp-feedstock/tree/main/.azure-pipelines\r\n",
