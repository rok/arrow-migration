        "title": "[R] Update write_csv_arrow() to support all args of readr::write_csv()",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14902](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14902). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently (arrow version 6.0.1 and readr version 2.1.0) we only support a few of the `readr::write_csv()` arguments. Once ARROW-13623 is fixed\u00a0`write_csv_arrow()`\u00a0will error if the\u00a0user passes unsupported `readr` arguments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe following\u00a0arguments need CsvWriteOptions (see linked issues) in order to be exposed to R users:\r\n \\* `{}na{`}: string used for missing values. Defaults to `{}NA{`}. Missing values are never quoted; strings with the same value as `na` will always be quoted.\r\n \\* `{}append{`}: boolean. If \\{[FALSE}} will overwrite existing file. If `TRUE` will append to existing file. In both cases, if the file doesn't exist, a new file is created.\r\n \\* `{}quote{`}: how to handle fields which contain characters that need to be quoted:\r\n \\*\\* `{}needed{`}: only quote fields which need them\r\n \\*\\* `{}all{`}: quote all fields - I think this might be the implicit default behaviour for `write_csv_arrow()`\r\n \\*\\* `{}none{`}: never quote fields\r\n \\* `{}escape{`}: the type of escape to use when quotes are in the data:\r\n \\*\\* `{}double{`}: quotes are escaped by doubling them\r\n \\*\\* `{}backslash{`}: quotes are escaped by a preceding backslash\r\n \\*\\* `{}none{`}: quotes are not escaped\r\n \\* `{}eol{`}: the end of line character to use. Most commonly either \"\\n\" for Unix style newlines, or \"\\r\\n\" for Windows style newlines.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOnce these are enabled, update the signature of `write_csv_arrow()` and compare written files. \r\nFrom ARROW-13623\u00a0\"I noticed we had a difference in quoting: readr doesn't quote strings by default but we do.\" Once we have more control over quoting, we could write some tests to make sure default behaviours between `write_csv_arrow() and {{readr::write_csv()`}} match.",
