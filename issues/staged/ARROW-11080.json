Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowup to ARROW-10322. In ARROW-9187, where we started making use of more compute functions in R, we found a couple of places where implicit casts weren't being inserted where they should:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8947/commits/843ff2a39d8a4e1c92247fb672567c0b85b4f45a#diff-79100695986bbd6a63704fe9f238ce3ae9a39ddd093b7f6b213d4a722309d20aR576 \"Function multiply_checked has no kernel matching input types (scalar[double], array[int32])\"\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8947/commits/843ff2a39d8a4e1c92247fb672567c0b85b4f45a#diff-79100695986bbd6a63704fe9f238ce3ae9a39ddd093b7f6b213d4a722309d20aR590  \"Function add_checked has no kernel matching input types (array[double], array[int32])\" because implicit casts are only applied to scalars to cast them to the type of the other argument\n  \n  This may speak to a need for more rules around how inputs should be casted/promoted in different contexts.",
