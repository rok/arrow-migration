Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2112. A kernel may want to throw if the memory being sorted is shared (in which case the user should copy, then sort)\r\n\r\nSorting of chunked data is a more complex topic so that's out of scope for this task",
