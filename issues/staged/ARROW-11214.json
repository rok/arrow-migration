        "title": "[Rust] [DataFusion] Add optional rust features for functions in library to keep dependencies down",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11214](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11214). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs we expand the numbers of functions available in DataFusion, DataFusion will likely pick up additional third-party dependencies. In general, I think it would be a nice feature for DataFusion to  allow users more fine grained control over the features that they wanted to use (and pay the subsequently higher compilation / link time (and binary size) cost. At the moment, with a single codebase and no feature flags, everyone's compile time and binary size will increase even if they don't use a specific set of features. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me like we might want to start offering a way to keep the number of required dependencies of DataFusion down. For example, in the case of https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9139, we could potentially put the use of crypto functions behind a feature flag. Users of DataFusion could then pick a subset of features  like \"core\" and \"func-datetime\" and \"func-crypto\" to have more control over the dependencies they pulled in\r\n\r\n",
