Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe don't currently have a simple/consistent way to track which exported functions for datetime functionality we do or do not support.\u00a0 We should go through all the exported functions in clock and lubridate which could theoretically be implemented in our NSE functions, and create Jira tickets for implementing them.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEven if a function cannot be implemented, we then have something searchable we can look for to see why, or to update if this changes, as well as link to the relevant C++ ticket where appropriate.",
