        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7012](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7012). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion on\u00a0ARROW-6784 and\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5686>. Among the questions:\r\n \\* Do Arrow users control the chunking, or is it an internal implementation detail they should not manage?\r\n \\* If users control it, how do they control it? E.g. if I call Take and use a ChunkedArray for the indices to take, does the chunking follow how the indices are chunked? Or should we attempt to preserve the mapping of data to their chunks in the input table/chunked array?\r\n \\* If it's an implementation detail, what is the optimal chunk size? And when is it worth reshaping (concatenating, slicing) input data to attain this optimal size?\u00a0",

The new kernels framework provides a configurability knob (`ExecContext::exec_chunksize`) for selecting the upper limit for the size of chunks that are processed"

There are multiple ways you could end up at the question of how you should chunk arrays, so I think compute is not quite the right place. Either way, we can move it/link to it from both/all relevant places."
