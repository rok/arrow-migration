        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15301](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15301). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWould it make sense to have all custom expectations in\u00a0`R/`\u00a0, maybe\u00a0`R/test-helpers.R`\u00a0? Reasons: \r\n \r\n \\* edit(added on 12/01/2022): probably the most important point is these files are source by `devtools::load_all()` and, thus, helper functions are available interactively. \r\n \\* easier for newbies to read a file and figure out what custom testthat helpers we have\r\n \\* easier to document\r\n \\* respects the testthat author's suggestion to have them there\r\n\r\nCurrently we have 17 different custom expectations, all defined in different files.\r\nA follow-up thought: maybe move all helpers there (`{}is.{`},\u00a0`{}as_{`},\u00a0`{}compare_{`},\u00a0`verify`\u00a0etc).",

Or maybe...new tests should be self-contained to the greatest extent possible? Those approaches wouldn't require new work and we might realize as we're writing new tests that we really do need the helpers. Just a few thoughts!\r\n"

Because `devtools::load_all()` sources (via `pkgload:::testthat_source_test_helpers()` all files ending in _helpers_ and, thus, any functions defined there are available interactively. In the current scenario if a developer needs to run a test block containing an \\{arrow}-specific helper function, they need to find where the helper is defined (source that file or run the lines) and then run the test block. I think this workflow adds quite a bit of friction.\r\n"

I think `pkgload::testthat_source_test_helpers()` sources all files that start with the word `helper` from the test directory (`tests/testthat`).\r\n\r\nIt turns out this is less of a problem that I initially thought. I still think it would be a good idea to move a bit more towards the canonical structure of the testing folders and helpers. "
