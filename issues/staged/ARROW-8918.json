Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBy setting the output type in `CastOptions`, we can write\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\ncall_function(\"cast\", [arg], cast_options)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis simplifies use of casting for binding developers. This mimics the standard SQL\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nCAST(expr AS target_type)\r\n```",
