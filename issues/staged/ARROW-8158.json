        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8158](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8158). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor string data buffer and base variable width vector can we have a way to get length of the data?\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor instance, in ArrowColumnVector in StringAccessor we use stringResult.start and stringResult.end, instead we would like to get length of the data through an exposed function.",
