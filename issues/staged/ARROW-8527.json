Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent implementation throws error in reader.cc:286 when skip_rows > header. However, in some workloads skip_rows used for not only skipping header but for just skipping first n-rows. In this case block-size constraint is greatly interferes. I think this constraint could be removed without performance reduction.",
