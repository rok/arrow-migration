Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPrior to 1.0.0, the RecordBatchStreamReader was capable of reading source CudaBuffers wrapped in a CudaBufferReader. In 1.0.0, the Array validation routines call into Buffer::data(), which throws an error if the source isn't in host memory.",
