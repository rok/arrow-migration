Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12698#discussion_r836484176\r\n\r\nWe should try to instruct sphinx/autodoc/numpydoc to not include `\\_\\_init\\_\\_` functions in the reference docs, as I don't think we have any case where this adds value (compared to the class docstring). See eg https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/python/generated/pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset.html#pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset.__init__\r\n\r\ncc `[~alenkaf]`",

Either using `\"autodoc-skip-member\"` event or with overriding the \"special-members\" default option (https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#confval-autodoc_default_options), it seems this should be possible."
