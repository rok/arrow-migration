        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17055](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17055). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello. I am trying to uptake arrow flight sql. We have a check in out build to make sure that there are no overlapping class files in our project. When adding the flight sql dependency to our project the warning throws that flight-sql and flight-core overlap and the jars deliver the same class files.\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nSample Warning: WARNING: CLASSPATH OVERLAP: These jars deliver the same class files: [flight-sql-7.0.0.jar, flight-core-7.0.0.jar] files: [org/apache/arrow/flight/impl/Flight$FlightDescriptor$1.class, org/apache/arrow/flight/impl/Flight$ActionOrBuilder.class\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\nIt seems that the classes generated by Flight.proto gets generated in both flight-sql and flight-core jars. Since these classes get generated in flight-core, and flight-sql is dependent on flight-core, can the generation of Flight.java and FlightServiceGrpc.java be removed from flight-sql and instead rely on it to be pulled directly from flight-core?\r\n\u00a0\r\nthanks in advance!",
