Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTL;DR one of CRAN's test machines uses a bespoke clang build that uses libc++ instead of libstdc+: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/Rconfig/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang. R may have various make conf set that it uses when compiling the R bindings in `r/src`, and we need to use those settings when we shell out to cmake to build Arrow C+. Package fails to load due to undefined symbols otherwise: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/arrow-00install.html",
