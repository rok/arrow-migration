        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9746](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9746). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs suggested by `[~jorgecarleitao]` on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7959#pullrequestreview-467291192 \u2013 \r\n\r\n> #### Other formats?\r\n> One thing I dislike about spark is that EXPLAIN is in a not-so-nice format to parse programmatically. One idea is to allow `explain` to return the result in json. This is e.g. useful to construct a visual graph representation of the plan. One idea would be to support another string parameter, `format`, and make it default to `string` (not necessarily in this PR).\r\n\r\nThe typical thing I have used in the past to great effect is graphviz: https://graphviz.org/ and `dot` \u2013 so the idea is that we would get a command like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nEXPLAIN FORMAT GRAPHVIZ SELECT * FROM FOO\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would provide the plan in graphviz format (in addition to text)\r\n",
