I thought we can't compile to wasm, so if the latest release does, then perhaps we can add this to nightly CI so we don't break this functionality again.\r\n\r\nThanks"

However, the latest version on master has the ability to read dictionary batches, hence the need to install from Git. Thanks for taking a look at the issue!\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
