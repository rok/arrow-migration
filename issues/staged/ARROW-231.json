Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of writing `Resize(sizeof(T) * size)`, it would be nice to have a function `Resize<T>(size)`\u00a0that resizes the array so it can take size elements of T. Probably we should call it differently than the non-typed version so they can be clearly differentiated.",
