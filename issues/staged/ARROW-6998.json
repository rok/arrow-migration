Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee this [pandas issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/29055) for more info. Many of the pandas `read_format()` methods allow you supply a URL except for the `read_feather()` method. This would be a nice to have feature.",
