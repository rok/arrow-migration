        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4947](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4947). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow that the Flight implementations are consistent and DoGet streams are self-describing, we should remove the schema parameter to DoGet in C++/Python, as it isn't actually used anywhere. We should also enforce that the first message in the stream is the schema (Java implicitly does this already).",
