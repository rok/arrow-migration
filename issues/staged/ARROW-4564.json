Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[ARROW-4528](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4528) silently removed `iwyu` from the list of installed packages. The `iwyu_tool.py` does _not_\u00a0propagate errors correctly if `iwyu` binary is not found. This seems to be resolved in more recent version, which will be addressed in [ARROW-4340](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4340).",
