Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have a `to_pandas` method on `Array` and `Column`\u00a0instances. The former produces a NumPy array whereas the latter a Pandas Series. We should add also a `to_pandas`\u00a0function to `ChunkedArray` that produces a contiguous NumPy array of all the underyling `pyarrow.Array` instances.",
