Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nString compute functions do not make use of locale settings for case changing transformations, string comparisons, and number to string casting. Arrow does provides UTF-8 string kernels to handle localization standardization. It would be good to add locale support for string kernels that are affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe following are string functions that take a `locale` option as its second argument:\r\n- str_to_lower\n- str_to_upper\n- str_to_title",
