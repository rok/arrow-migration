        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17072](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17072). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs noted in the following document, the recommended extension for IPC files is now `.arrow`.\r\n\r\n> We recommend the \u201c.arrow\u201d extension for files created with this format.\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-file-format\r\n\r\nHowever, the R library cannot read IPC files without using the `read_feather` function after ARROW-16268.\r\nI think users will be confused if you keep using this function name because the word `feather' is not associated with `.arrow` for beginners.\r\n\r\nFor example, could we deprecate function `read_feather` and recommend another function like `read_ipc_file`, which has the same functionality?\r\n\r\nNote: This ticket was created as a result of a conversation with `[~kou]` on Twitter.\r\nhttps://twitter.com/ktou/status/1547373388687376386",
