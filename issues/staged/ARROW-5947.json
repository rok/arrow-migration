        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5947](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5947). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI added a dependency to serde_json early on so that I could serialize logical query plans because I wanted a way to pass them between processes. However, this was just a short term hack and is non-standard. I would like to remove this now.\r\n\r\nI am now using gRPC in another project and serializing plans that way based on the Gandiva protobuf def. I will start a discussion on the mailing list in the next 1-2 weeks about pushing some changes into the Arrow repo related to this.",
