        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13527](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13527). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGiven the following use case:\r\n1. Starting from a `RecordBatch`\n1. Apply a Compute Function on one column\n1. Add the result (`Datum`) as a new column to the `RecordBatch`\n   \n   Since `Datum::array` returns `ArrayData`, it might be useful to have `RecordBatch::AddColumn` and `SetColumn` work with `ArrayData` as well. This would avoid having to call `Datum::make_array`.\n   \n   \u00a0",
