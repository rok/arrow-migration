Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee the conversation [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3925#discussion_r281187184).\r\n\r\nWe should change MemoryAllocator to not return `null` when the requested memory length is `0`. Instead, we should create a cached \"NullObject\" IMemoryOwner that\u00a0has a no-op `Dispose` method, and always returns `Memory<T>.Empty`.\r\n\r\nThis way consuming code doesn't need to check for `null` being returned from MemoryAllocator.Allocate.",
