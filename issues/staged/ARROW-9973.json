Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDateConsumer seems to do an overflow check when converting from a SQL Date and sees if the TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toDays(<sql time>) is negative. This is how any date less than 1970-01-01 will be represented, so unfortunately the adapter breaks for these values.",
