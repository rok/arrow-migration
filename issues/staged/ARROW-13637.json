(for which now documentation is missing) If so maybe update the title of the issue to reflect that?\r\n\r\nFor the pyarrow.compute cases in the list you added in the attachment, for most of those the docstring is autogenerated. And we don't yet automatically include the docstring for the parameters from the options class (I thought we had a separate JIRA for that, but don't directly find it)"
