        "title": "[Python] Option for integer object nulls",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2205](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2205). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have a use case where the loss of precision in casting integers to floats matters, and pandas supports storing integers with nulls without loss of precision in object columns. However, a roundtrip through arrow will cast the object columns to float columns, even though the object columns are stored in arrow as integers with nulls.\r\n\r\nThis is a minimal example demonstrating the\u00a0behavior of a roundtrip:\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\": np.array([None, 1], dtype=object)})\r\ndf_pa = pa.Table.from_pandas(df).to_pandas()\r\n\r\nprint(df)\r\nprint(df_pa)\r\n```\r\nThe output is:\r\n```Java\n\r\n\u00a0     a\r\n0  None\r\n1     1\r\n     a\r\n0  NaN\r\n1  1.0\r\n```\r\nThis seems to be the desired behavior, given test_int_object_nulls in test_convert_pandas.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to add an option in the to_pandas methods to allow integers with nulls to be returned as object columns. The option can default to false in order to preserve the current behavior.",
