        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8974](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8974). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[TransferBitmap](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/44e723d9ac7c64739d419ad66618d2d56003d1b7/cpp/src/arrow/util/bit_util.cc#L110) has two template parameters of bool type with four combinations.\r\nChange them to function parameters can reduce code size. I think \"restore_trailing_bits\" cannot impact performance. \"invert_bits\" needs benchmark.\r\nAlso, bool parameter is hard to figure out at [caller side](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/44e723d9ac7c64739d419ad66618d2d56003d1b7/cpp/src/arrow/util/bit_util.cc#L208), better to use meaningful defines.",
