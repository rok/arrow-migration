Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe following code causes segfault\n```Java\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\ns = pd.Series([1, '-'])\npa.Array.from_pandas(s)\n```\n\nArrow vector cannot hold mixed types, and raising an exception here instead of segfault is much better IMHO.",
