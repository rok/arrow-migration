Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee warning and TODO added in ARROW-10358. Would be ideal not to use the binary if system requirements aren't met (and fall back to source build, which doesn't have to require them), rather than fail with an undefined symbols error later. Aside from that not being an ideal user experience, the warning message and the link error will be far apart in the logs, so I expect we'll be getting bug reports about this.",
