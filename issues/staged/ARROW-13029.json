Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor convenience, we should expose a link to headings on pages like the FAQ and in blog posts, so you can easily link to a particular FAQ entry or a section of a release post in things like answering StackOverflow questions. (Headings already have an ID assigned, there's just no link exposed to easily grab.)",
