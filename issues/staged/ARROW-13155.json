        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13155](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13155). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the map generator will allow the map function to run in parallel but it will not forward reentrant pressure onto the source generator.\u00a0 Instead it queues requests.\r\n\r\nIn some cases this is the right decision (if source is not async reentrant) but in some cases we want it to forward the pressure (so that the entire chain can run in parallel).\r\n\r\nBy making it an option when the mapped generator is created we can allow pressure to be forwarded where appropriate.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhrasing it another way.\u00a0 If we have source, map function A, map function B, map function C, and then a reentrant pull we would currently only run C in parallel.",
