        "title": "[C++] Define API for embedding user-defined metadata / Flatbuffer message types in Arrow IPC machinery",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1059](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1059). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the `MessageHeader` Flatbuffer union must be modified to serialize new kinds of metadata:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Message.fbs#L85\n\nIt would be interesting if user metadata could be embedded within a particular application that wishes to use the Arrow C++ libraries' zero-copy IPC machinery for serialization of other kinds of data structures. \n\nAs one approach, the message metadata could be an application-dependent unique identifier for the user defined type, which would internally dispatch to an implementation of an abstract deserializer interface. So in addition to describing the serialized representation of the user type, we also will have to create the abstract API for the user to implement so that the code in `arrow/ipc` can be configured to dispatch appropriately.

There's the discussion about allowing binary values in the existing key-value metadata of course but that is different from this."
