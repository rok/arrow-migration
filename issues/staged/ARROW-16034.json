As raised in the [PR](<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12711>) for this [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16007), wondering if this should be mimicked in the arrow bindings as well? `[~jonkeane]` requested I open this here for discussion.",

Looking at the implementation for `grepl`, it wouldn't take much overhead at all to add a warning when those two arguments are given. I would be in favor of doing this to be extra clear and helpful. I'm curious if `[~icook]` has any reason this didn't or wouldn't work form the original implementation?"
