        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18231](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18231). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn release mode, Arrow C++ unconditionally adds `-O2` _at the end_ of the compiler flags.\r\nSo, if you do something like:\r\n```bash\n\r\nexport CXXFLAGS=-O0\r\ncmake ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe final compilation flags will look like `-O0 -O2`, meaning the user-provided optimization level is ignored.\r\n\r\nOne can instead use the `ARROW_CXXFLAGS` CMake variable, but it only overrides the flags for Arrow itself, not the bundled dependencies.\r\n",
