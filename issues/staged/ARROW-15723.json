There are potentially multiple issues here.\r\n\r\nFirst, writing null arrays is not actually supported (yet). When using the OrcWriter API directly, we can see this (using the table from the code snippet above):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [3]: writer = orc.ORCWriter(\"test.orc\")\r\n\r\nIn [4]: writer.write(table)\r\n...\r\nArrowNotImplementedError: Unknown or unsupported Arrow type: null\r\n../src/arrow/adapters/orc/util.cc:1062  GetOrcType(*arrow_child_type)\r\n../src/arrow/adapters/orc/adapter.cc:811  GetOrcType(*(table.schema()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, it seems that for some reason this error is not bubbled up when using `write_table` (which uses this ORCWriter in a context manager).\r\n\r\nThen, it further seems that the segfault comes from trying to write (close) an empty file. This can be reproduced with the following as well:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [1]: from pyarrow import orc\r\n\r\nIn [2]: writer = orc.ORCWriter(\"test.orc\")\r\n\r\nIn [3]: writer.close()\r\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\r\n```"
