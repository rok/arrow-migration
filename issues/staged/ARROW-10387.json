Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is an extension to [ARROW-10368](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10368).\r\n\r\nWhen reading a Parquet file, you first need to read its footer and metadata. If you only have \"read from start\" capability, this means you need the size of the file to read relatively to end. On some storages, getting the size metadata can be expensive (e.g extra http call for blob storage).\r\n\r\nThe proposition is to add the capability to \"read from end\" to the ChunkReader trait as most file storages will have this feature (file storage as well as blob storages).",
