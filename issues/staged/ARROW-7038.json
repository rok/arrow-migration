        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7038](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7038). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPython always hangs when it reads the parquet file from hdfs twice after sending ctrl+c.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce,\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\npq.read_table('hdfs://localhost:9000/path/to/parquet')\r\n# Ctrl+C here\r\npq.read_table('hdfs://localhost:9000/path/to/parquet')\r\n# hangs\n```\r\nThere's the weird thing ctrl+c at line 3 doesn't produce KeyboardInterrupt even though using the local file produces it at all.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\npq.read_table('/home/path/to/localfile')\r\n# doing Ctrl+C here prints out 'KeyboardInterrupt'\r\npq.read_table('/home/path/to/localfile')\r\n# run properly\n```\r\nIs this a sort of bug from JNI?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

You're using a pretty old version of pyarrow, you should see if the issue is still present with 0.15.1 (though it probably is). I don't know how the Ctrl-C signal get propagated when the execution is inside the Java libraries"

There might be some other projects out there (jpype comes to mind?) that have dealt with this particular issue to look to for inspiration about what we might do"
