        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5501](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5501). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nread_feather and write_feather exist, and there is also write_arrow. But no read_arrow.\r\n\r\nSome questions (which go beyond just R): There's talk of a \"feather 2.0\", i.e. \"just\" serializing the IPC format (which IIUC is what write_arrow does). Are we going to continue to call the file format \"Feather\", and possibly\u00a0continue supporting the \"feather 1.0\" format as a subset/special case? Or will \"feather\" mean this limited format and \"arrow\" be the name of the full-featured file?\r\n\r\nIn terms of this issue, should write_arrow be folded into write_feather and there be an argument for indicating which version to write? Or should the distinction be maintained, and we need to add a read_arrow() function?",
