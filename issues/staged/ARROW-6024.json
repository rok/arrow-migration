        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6024). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nProvide more hash algorithms to choose for different scenarios. In particular, we provide the following hash algorithms:\r\n \\* Simple hasher: A hasher that calculates the hash code of integers as is, and do not perform any finalization. So the computation is extremely efficient, but the quality of the produced hash code may not be good.\r\n\r\n \\* Murmur finalizing hasher: Finalize the hash code by the Murmur hashing algorithm. Details of the algorithm can be found in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash>. Murmur hashing is computational expensive, as it involves several integer multiplications. However, the produced hash codes have good quality in the sense that they are uniformly distributed in the universe.",
