FlightRPC DoGet benchmark speed is 2634 MB/s for gRPC, and 3874 MB/s for UCX/RDMA. Looks great. It's even faster than localhost (2834 on server, 3359 MB/s on client).\r\n\r\nPlease note current code is not stable for RDMA. Most benchmark tests hang, only very few tries happen to work. And UCX/TCP benchmark (1738 MB/s) is much worse than gRPC. I think there are still big potentials to improve.\r\n\r\nFind a way to stably test UCX/RDMA. \r\n- start server\n- start client, wait some time (~10 seconds), ctrl-c\n- start client again, now it works okay afterwards"
