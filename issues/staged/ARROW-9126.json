        "title": "[C++] Trimmed Boost bundle fails to build on Windows",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9126](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9126). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBuild with the following commands\r\n```java\n\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake .. -DARROW_PARQUET=ON\r\ncmake --build .\n```\r\nError from build log\r\n```java\n\r\n.\\boost/graph/two_bit_color_map.hpp(106): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'boost/graph/detail/empty_header.hpp': No such file or directory\r\n```\r\nThis was because configuring Boost to build a subset of libraries doesn't work on Windows as it does on Linux. As a result, all libraries, including those being trimmed, were built:\r\n```java\n\r\nComponent configuration:\r\n\r\n - atomic : building\r\n - chrono : building\r\n - container : building\r\n - date_time : building\r\n - exception : building\r\n - filesystem : building\r\n - headers : building\r\n - iostreams : building\r\n - locale : building\r\n - log : building\r\n - mpi : building\r\n - program_options : building\r\n - python : building\r\n - random : building\r\n - regex : building\r\n - serialization : building\r\n - system : building\r\n - test : building\r\n - thread : building\r\n - timer : building\r\n - wave : building\r\n```",
