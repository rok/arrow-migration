Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollow up work to ARROW-554. \r\n\r\nUnifying multiple dictionary-encoded arrays is one use case. Another is rewriting a DictionaryArray to be based on another dictionary. For example, this would be used to implement Cast from one dictionary type to another.\r\n\r\nThis will need to be able to insert nulls where there are values that are not found in the target dictionary\r\n\r\nsee also discussion at https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3165#discussion_r243025730",
