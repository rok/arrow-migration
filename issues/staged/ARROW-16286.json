        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16286](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16286). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf an expression is non-deterministic (e.g. \"random\") then SimplifyWithGuarantee may incorrectly think it can fold constants.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the call is `random()` then `SimplifyWithGuarantee` will detect that all the arguments are constants (or, more accurately, there are zero non-constant arguments) and decide it can execute the expression immediately and fold it into a constant.\r\n\r\nWe could maybe add a hack for the random case since it is the only nullary function but, in general, we will probably need a way to define functions as \"non-deterministic\" and prevent constant folding.",
