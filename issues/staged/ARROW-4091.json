Perhaps not any strings  at all (i.e. the default is that the only way to get missing values from CSV is if you have an empty cell). The R package and pyarrow/pandas bindings may want to have different defaults that match their users' expectations--for example, \"NA\" is the default `na.strings` for R but isn't how missing is spelled in every other language, so it would make sense for R users to have that default but probably not in the C++ library. Does that make sense?"

I might find it convenient that the defaults of the C++ library are the same as the base R CSV reader, but I don't know if a pandas user would find the same defaults convenient. I'm happy enough to make the defaults of the CSV reader-as-used-from-R be the same as the R defaults, regardless of what the C++ default is."
