I was under the impression that big endian is used. This is based on the documentation in the [parquet crate](https://docs.rs/parquet/2.0.0/parquet/basic/enum.LogicalType.html#variant.DECIMAL). Does the encoding always differ for arrow serialization or am I missing something?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, the type is Decimal(3,2), however the values are e.g. -11697. My understanding so far was (again this is probably just true for parquet) that this values does not fit in Decimal(3,2) but if it is actually -116.97 it should be Decimal(5, 2).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI am a bit out of my depth here, so if you have some documentation as to when I have to deal with which encoding, that would be very helpful."
