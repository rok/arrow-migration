Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current Plasma header (version, type, and length) is written in native endian at [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/plasma/io.cc#L65-L71). It will be hard to interpret the Plasma data among different endian platforms in the future.\r\n\r\nAt least, the header should be written in the pre-defined endian. ",
