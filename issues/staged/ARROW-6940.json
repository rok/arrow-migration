It looks like there's a few things left to do:\r\n \\* Expose custom_metadata from the record batch reader/writer\r\n \\* Implement it in Flight (possibly doing the (de)compression in the background to avoid blocking the consumer/producer)\r\n\r\nI could take a look at it when I get to trying compression with Flight."

I don't think it's needed for Flight but I do think we need to take a second look at compression + Flight."
