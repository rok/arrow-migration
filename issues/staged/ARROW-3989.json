Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExcel saves booleans in CSV in upper case, Pandas uses Proper case.\r\n\r\nOur CSV reader doesn't recognise (True,\u00a0False, TRUE, FALSE). I noticed this when making boolean schema inference case insensitive.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI would propose that we convert Boolean strings to lower-case before casting them to Rust's bool type. `[~andygrove]`, what do you think?",
