        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9137](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9137). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment only `gparquet_arrow_file_reader_read_table` is exported which requires the reader to load all row-groups. Additionally, it would be extremely helpful to have access to the `ReadRowGroup` method which would allow reading parts of the file without having to load everything into memory.",
