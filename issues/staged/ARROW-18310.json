Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are a few places in the code (sink_node.cc, source_node.cc, file_base.cc) where the backpressure counter is of type `int32_t`. This prevents `ExecNode::Pause(...)` and\u00a0 `ExecNode::Resume(...)` from being thread-safe. The proposal is to make these backpressure counters be of type `std::atomic<int32_t>`.",
