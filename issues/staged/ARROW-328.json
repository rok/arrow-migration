Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is largely my fault but: many C++ programmers seem to feel that you should always return `std::shared_ptr` by value for a couple reasons:\n\n- RVO in many cases prevents a double ref-count manipulation and,\n- If you are planning to share ownership with the other class, you will need to copy the shared_ptr anyway\n\nOn some contemplation I'm +1 on changing all `const std::shared_ptr<T>&` to `std::shared_ptr<T>`, but let me know if there are other opinions.
