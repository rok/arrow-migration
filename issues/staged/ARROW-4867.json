This used to be the case in previous versions.\r\n\r\n0.12:\r\n```java\n\r\nIn [1]: pyarrow.Table.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame(dict(a=[1],b=[2])), columns=['b', 'a'])\r\nOut[1]:\r\npyarrow.Table\r\na: int64\r\nb: int64\n```\r\n0.11:\r\n```java\n\r\nIn [1]: pyarrow.Table.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame(dict(a=[1],b=[2])), columns=['b', 'a'])\r\nOut[1]:\r\npyarrow.Table\r\nb: int64\r\na: int64\n```",

I reviewed the discussion in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3766 and the behavior introduced in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2979 I believe to be erroneous. The requirement in that patch was to respect the passed `schema` argument. The change not to respect the ordering of the columns argument was out of scope and can be discussed separately"
