        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17829](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17829). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed the following warnings in our test builds:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nopt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyarrow/tests/test_dataset.py::test_make_fragment\r\n  /opt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyarrow/tests/test_dataset.py:197: FutureWarning: In a future version of pandas, a length 1 tuple will be returned when iterating over a groupby with a grouper equal to a list of length 1. Don't supply a list with a single grouper to avoid this warning.\r\n    for part, chunk in df_d.groupby([\"color\"]):\r\n\r\nopt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyarrow/tests/test_dataset.py::test_legacy_write_to_dataset_drops_null\r\nopt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyarrow/tests/parquet/test_pandas.py::test_write_to_dataset_pandas_preserve_extensiondtypes[True]\r\nopt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyarrow/tests/parquet/test_pandas.py::test_write_to_dataset_pandas_preserve_index[True]\r\n  /opt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet/core.py:3326: FutureWarning: In a future version of pandas, a length 1 tuple will be returned when iterating over a groupby with a grouper equal to a list of length 1. Don't supply a list with a single grouper to avoid this warning.\r\n    for keys, subgroup in data_df.groupby(partition_keys):\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose those are coming from pandas 1.5.0. We should investigate whether this is something to fix in our code (or just in the tests)",
