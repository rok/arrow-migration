        "title": "[MATLAB] Reduce MATLAB CI Build Time by Building Arrow C++ Libraries separately and using Packaged GoogleTest",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13647](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13647). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs part of ARROW-13202, we investigated approaches for reducing the build time of MATLAB Interface CI jobs. Right now we build and run the the Arrow C++ tests as part of the MATLAB Interface build in order to make use of the bundled GoogleTest binaries.\r\n\r\nIt may help to reduce overall build times if we instead build just the minimal Arrow C++ libraries (without the C++ tests) and install GoogleTest on the GitHub Actions Runner using apt-get.",
