Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith Python 2, currently we generate `unicode` strings for a column with `to_pandas` but generate `str` strings for `to_pylist`. This should be aligned as well as some tests with non-ASCII characters added that verify the UTF-8 roundtrip.",
