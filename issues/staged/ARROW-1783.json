Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion on Dask org:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/931\r\n\r\nIt would be valuable for downstream users to compute the serialized payload as a sequence of memoryview-compatible objects without having to allocate new memory on write. This means that the component tensor messages must have their metadata and bodies in separate buffers. This will require a bit of work internally reassemble the object from a collection of `pyarrow.Buffer` objects\r\n\r\nsee also ARROW-1509",
