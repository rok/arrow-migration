        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8644](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8644). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-3861 (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7050), I \"fixed\" a bug that the partition columns are always included even when the user did a manual column selection.\r\n\r\nBut apparently, this behaviour was being relied upon by dask. See the failing nightly integration tests: https://circleci.com/gh/ursa-labs/crossbow/11854?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link\r\n\r\nSo the best option might be to just keep the \"old\" behaviour for the legacy ParquetDataset, when using the new datasets API (`use_legacy_datasets=False`), you get the new / correct behaviour.",
