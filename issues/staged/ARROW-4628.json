        "title": "[Rust] [DataFusion] Implement type coercion query optimizer rule",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4628](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4628). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow that we have a query optimizer, we should re-implement type coercion as an optimizer rule that rewrites expressions with explicit casts where required, so that at runtime we are only comparing like types.\r\n\r\nFor example, the expression `float_column < int_column`\u00a0would be rewritten as `float_column < CAST(int_column AS float)`.\r\n\r\nDataFusion already has this logic but the current implementation is somewhat hacky and incomplete. Moving it to the optimizer will allow us to implement this correctly.",
