        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12564). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor a single array (`MapArray`) there are the `.keys` and `.items` attributes (in Python, corresponding to `MapArray::keys()/items()` in C++) to extract the keys or items as a new array. \r\n\r\nHowever, when eg having a Table column as a ChunkedArray, there is not easy way to get a new ChunkedArray of keys (except by iterating through the chunks in Python: `keys = pa.chunked_array([chunk.keys for chunk in map_data.iterchunks()])`)\r\n\r\nWe could add compute kernels `map_keys`/`map_items` to do this for both array or chunked array.",
