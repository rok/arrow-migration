Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's failing now because of a timeout. My guess (from the available logs) is that since duckdb vendors everything, it's really slow to compile with sanitizers on, so we should probably exclude it from this build. \r\n\r\nAlso, ARROW-13495 revealed a UBSAN warning in one of the dataset examples. Our sanitizer job only runs the tests, so we should also run the examples.",
