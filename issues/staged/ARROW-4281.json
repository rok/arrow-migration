Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe're currently using the Trusty VMs on Travis-CI. Besides the fact that Ubuntu Trusty is soon 5 years old, it forces us to use the old pre-C++ ABI migration conda-forge packages. We should migrate all or most jobs to Xenial.",
