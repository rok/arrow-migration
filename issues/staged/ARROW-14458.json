        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14458](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14458). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUpdate (2022, January 20):\r\n[Hadley's suggestion](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/1471#issuecomment-1005372257) would be to move away from the\r\n```r\n\r\nexpect_snapshot({\r\n  (expect_error())\r\n})\u00a0\r\n```\r\npattern and use one of 3 options:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n \\* If you want to inspect the error message, use `{}expect_snapshot(error = TRUE){`}.\r\n \\* If you want to check the class, use `expect_error(class = )`\r\n \\* If you want to expect the message and check the class, use `{}expect_snapshot_error(class = ){`}.\r\n\r\nI have being using option 1 and it seems to do most of what we want. For example, see the [left_join by arg PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12179).\r\n\r\n==============\r\nThis comes from [Romain's suggestion](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11502/files/2a8a139b727acb13019da6176444578ead6bf208#r735351673) to transform the test that rely on capturing a string by using a snapshot test (added in `{}testthat{`}'s 3rd edition).\r\n\r\nA test like:\r\n```r\n\r\nexpect_error(expression, message)\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```r\n\r\nexpect_snapshot({\r\n  (expect_error(expression))\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThis is probably a more general improvement we can make to our unit tests (i.e. to make more extensive use of the snapshot functionality), but I thought I'd focus on one test file to begin with.",

This is one of the use cases in which the power of `expect_snapshot()` shines through."
