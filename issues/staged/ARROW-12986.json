Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nActually, the eviction policy algorithm used by Gandiva's cache is based on LRU.\r\n\r\nI suggest to add a new option of eviction algorithm to use that considers the LLVM build time as a cost, and evicts the elements based on the GrredyDual-Size algorithm.",
