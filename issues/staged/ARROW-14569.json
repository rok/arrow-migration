        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14569](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14569). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTrying to write a pandas categorical created from `pd.cut` fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\ndf_test = pd.DataFrame({\"cat\": pd.cut([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], bins=[2, 4])})\r\ndf_test.to_parquet(\"test.parquet\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nFile \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 120, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowNotImplementedError: Unsupported cast from dictionary<values=extension<pandas.interval<ArrowIntervalType>>, indices=int8, ordered=1> to extension<pandas.interval<ArrowIntervalType>> (no available cast function for target type)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problems seems to be the interval dtype. Specifing the `labels` keyword solved the problem.",
