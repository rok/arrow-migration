Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in the [sort functions](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html#sorts-and-partitions), nulls are considered greater than any other value and are sorted at the the end of the array. Add an option to enable users to sort nulls at the beginning if they wish. This option is common in analytic data systems, e.g. SQL `NULLS FIRST` and `NULLS LAST`,\u00a0pandas `na_position`, R `na.last`.",
