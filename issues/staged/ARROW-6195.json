Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI had this error message while I was trying to reproduce another issue in docker.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM debian:buster \r\nRUN apt-get update \r\nRUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y git build-essential cmake \r\n \r\nWORKDIR /app \r\nRUN git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git \r\nWORKDIR /app/arrow/cpp/build \r\nRUN git checkout 167cea0 # HEAD as of 10-Aug-19\r\nRUN cmake -DARROW_PARQUET=ON -DARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=BUNDLED .. \r\nRUN cmake --build . --target thrift_ep -j 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelevant part of output:\r\n```\r\nScanning dependencies of target thrift_ep\r\n[ 66%] Creating directories for 'thrift_ep'\r\n[ 66%] Performing download step (verify and extract) for 'thrift_ep'\r\nCMake Error at thrift_ep-stamp/verify-thrift_ep.cmake:11 (message):\r\n File not found: /thrift/0.12.0/thrift-0.12.0.tar.gz\r\nmake[3]: \\*\\*\\* [CMakeFiles/thrift_ep.dir/build.make:90: thrift_ep-prefix/src/thrift_ep-stamp/thrift_ep-download] Error 1 \r\nmake[2]: \\*\\*\\* [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:916: CMakeFiles/thrift_ep.dir/all] Error 2\r\nmake[1]: \\*\\*\\* [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:928: CMakeFiles/thrift_ep.dir/rule] Error 2\r\nmake: \\*\\*\\* [Makefile:487: thrift_ep] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstalling python fixes the problem, but this isn't directly clear from the error message. The source of issue is that execute_process in get_apache_mirrors macro silently fails and returns empty APACHE_MIRROR value since PYTHON_EXECUTABLE was empty.",
