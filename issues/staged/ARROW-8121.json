Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is in response to a discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6039#discussion_r375161992\r\n\r\nWe found the current style checking for Java code is not sufficient. So we want to enhace it in a series of \"small\" steps, in order to avoid having to change too many files at once.\r\n\r\nIn this issue, we add spaces after commas, semi-colons and type casts.",
