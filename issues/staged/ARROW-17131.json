Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nJoris suggested here \"we could also add a `field()` method that returns you a field? (that is more discoverable than `{}[]{`}, and would be consistent with a Schema and with StructArray (to get the child array for that field)\".\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCompletion of this issue would also mean updating the example in the API docs for StructType to mention `.field()`.",
