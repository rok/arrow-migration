Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nS3 writes can be synchronous: when a part is uploaded, Write() will only return once the server has received the contents and responded \"Ok\".\r\n\r\nWe may want to add a S3 option to issue writes in the background (e.g. using the S3 client's asynchronous APIs).\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is to provide a general OutputStream implementation that backgrounds writes (this should be independent of BufferedOutputStream, though, because S3FileSystem already has its own buffering layer).\r\n",
