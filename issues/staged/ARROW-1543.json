        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1543](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1543). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the row_wise_conversion code example we find:\n\n```Java\n    std::shared_ptr<DoubleBuilder> components_values_builder =\n        std::make_shared<DoubleBuilder>(arrow::default_memory_pool());\n    arrow::ListBuilder components_builder(arrow::default_memory_pool(),\n        components_values_builder);\n```\n\nThis generates some compile time errors since the second argument of the ListBuilder constructor expects a unique pointer.\n\nHowever, I guess the example shows the correct case, where we want to still be able to use the DoubleBuilder after constructing the ListBuilder, so I probably shouldn't std::move it to the constructor as a unique_ptr.\n\nI'm not sure how to fix this as I don't know which functionality is desired.",

It should not be happening again very soon, but we'll need to conform this to the current API"
