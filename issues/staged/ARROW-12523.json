        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12523](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12523). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe MakeEnumeratedGenerator operator buffers blocks by 1 so it can properly mark a block as \"last\" (e.g. when it receives an EOF it releases the last block, marks it last, and then releases an EOF).\r\n\r\nHowever, this adds complexity (this is very evident in the testing for unordered scan) and could potentially disrupt cache locality.\u00a0 For example, a thread will receive batch X, parse & decode batch X, then filter and project batch X-1.\r\n\r\nWe could push the responsibility of tagging the last batch/fragment into the readers themselves or we could release an empty \"last\" batch which serves as a token to the later resequencer (think of it as an end-of-fragment token in addition to the end-of-scan token we already have).",
