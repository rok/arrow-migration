Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/ab5fc979c69ccc5dde07e1bc1467b02951b4b7e9/rust/arrow/src/datatypes.rs#L1832-L1860\r\n\r\nI was looking at this code yesterday while using it in IOx \u2013 https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/pull/703\r\n\r\nEven though Schema::try_merge requires a slice of Schemas (not schema refs), it copies all of its fields. This is not ideal in the common case where most of the fields in the Schema will be the same",
