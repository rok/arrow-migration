Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt is not clear what the difference is between Tables and Record Batches is as described on <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/tables.html#tables>\r\n\r\n_A [`arrow::Table`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/table.html#_CPPv4N5arrow5TableE) is a two-dimensional dataset with chunked arrays for columns_\r\n\r\n_A [`arrow::RecordBatch`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/table.html#_CPPv4N5arrow11RecordBatchE) is a two-dimensional dataset of a number of contiguous arrays_\r\n\r\nOr maybe the distinction between _chunked arrays_ and _contiguous arrays_ can be clarified.",

Record batches don't even have exclude ownership over the arrays they contain; a single array might be referenced by multiple record batches. "
