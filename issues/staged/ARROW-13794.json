        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13794](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13794). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`ParquetVersion::type` currently has two members: `PARQUET_1_0` and `PARQUET_2_0`. The latter enables a hodgepodge of features which were actually added in Parquet format 2.4 and 2.6 (and others?).\r\n\r\nTo allow more fine-grained selection of the format version, we should deprecate this value and add `PARQUET_2_4` and `PARQUET_2_6` values.",
