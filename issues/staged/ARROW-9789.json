Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn ARROW-6437 (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7928) we saw occasional \"File exists\" errors on jemalloc_ep on macOS. Googling the error message led back to ARROW-739 (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/456), which fixed this before by forcing install with `-j1`. ARROW-3492 later made it so jemalloc would build (but not install) in parallel. Then ARROW-3539 (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2779) was addressing a problem with that change and, along with fixing the build parallelization issue, unfortunately reverted the original `make -j1 install` fix.",
