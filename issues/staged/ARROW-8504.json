Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor nullability data, in many cases nulls are not evenly distributed.\u00a0 In these cases it would be beneficial to have a mechanism to understand when runs of set/unset bits are encountered.\u00a0 One example of this is writing translating a bitmap to parquet definition levels .\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn implementation path could be to add this as method on Bitmap that makes an adaptor callback for VisitWords but I think at least for parquet an iterator API might be more appropriate (something that is easily stoppable/resumable).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
