Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSEH exceptions are raised by Windows when (for example) a SIGSEGV would be emitted by Linux. When encountered in CI they are [very opaque](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/37706635/job/k5q1oid2tuh5tuuv#L1695):\r\n```Java\n\r\n[ RUN      ] Expression.FoldConstants\r\nunknown file: error: SEH exception with code 0xc0000005 thrown in the test body.\r\n[  FAILED  ] Expression.FoldConstants (1 ms)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to show a stack trace for the exception, which would aid in debugging\r\nhttps://github.com/JochenKalmbach/StackWalker",
