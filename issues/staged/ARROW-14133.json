Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMost scalar arithmetic functions use variants of **MakeXXXFunction** to create a **ScalarFunction** which is then registered in another statement. Function registration can be moved inside of the **MakeXXXFunctions** and renamed as **AddXXXFunction** to simplify/reduce the code. This also applies to some scalar string **MakeXXX** functions.",
