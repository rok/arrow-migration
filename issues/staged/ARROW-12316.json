Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBenchmarking shows that mimalloc seems to be faster on real workflows (at least on macOS, still collecting data on Ubuntu). We could switch the default memory pool cases so that mimalloc is preferred. \r\n\r\ncc `[~jonkeane]` `[~apitrou]`",

On macOS, we should prefer mimalloc if available; elsewhere we prefer jemalloc (though note that jemalloc is not available on Windows, so mimalloc is de facto preferred there). This makes sense given that we had to do some special handling of jemalloc settings on macOS, and it is reasonable to believe that those settings have negative effects on performance."
