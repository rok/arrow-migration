        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8618](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8618). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince `ASSIGN_OR_RAISE` consumes its `Result` argument anyway, there's no reason not to cast that argument to an rvalue reference whenever possible. This will decrease boilerplate when handling non-temporary `Result`s, for example when yielding from an iterator:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n for (auto maybe_batch : scan_task->Execute()) {\r\n-  ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(auto batch, std::move(maybe_batch));\r\n+  ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(auto batch, maybe_batch);\r\n }\r\n```",
