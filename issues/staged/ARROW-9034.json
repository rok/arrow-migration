Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current BitBlockCounter from ARROW-9029 is useful for unary operations. Some operations involve multiple bitmaps and so it's useful to be able to determine the block popcounts of the AND of the respective words in the bitmaps. So each returned block would contain the number of bits that are set in both bitmaps at the same locations",
