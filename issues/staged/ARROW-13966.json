Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nEven decimal-decimal comparisons return an error:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n> Scalar$create(1.5)$cast(decimal(15, 2)) > Scalar$create(1.1)$cast(decimal(15, 2))\r\nError: NotImplemented: Function greater has no kernel matching input types (scalar[decimal128(15, 2)], scalar[decimal128(15, 2)])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would also be able to (autocast in order to) compare decimal-float or decimal-integer.",
