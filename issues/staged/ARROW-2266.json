        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2266](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2266). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was surprised to see that travis_script_integration.sh is taking over 25 minutes to run (https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/349493491). My only real guess about what's going on is that JVM startup time on these hosts is super slow.\r\n\r\nI can think of some things we could do to make things better:\r\n\r\n- Add debugging output so we can see what's slow\n- Write a Java integration test handler that validates multiple files at once\n- Generate a single set of binary files for each producer rather than regenerating them each time (so Java would only need to produce binary files once instead of 3 times like now)",
