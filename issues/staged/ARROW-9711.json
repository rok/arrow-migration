Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe need better benchmarks for testing at scale, so TPC benchmarks are ideal since data can be generated at different scale factors.
