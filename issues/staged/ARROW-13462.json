Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncompute.rst includes some examples of invoking compute functions which implicitly convert from shared_ptr<ArrayData> to shared_ptr<Array>.
