Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen reading a parquet containing time data:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`>>> import pyarrow.dataset`\r\n`>>> ds = pyarrow.dataset.dataset('foo.parquet', format='parquet')`\r\n`>>> ds.schema[1].type`\r\n`DataType(time32[ms])`\r\n\r\nI get `DataType` rather than `{}Time32Type{`}, which means I can't query time units.\r\n\r\nI assume this is an issue for other non-basic types.\r\n\r\nI can write code to scrape the type's string representation. Is there a better way?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
