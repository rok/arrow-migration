Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\"To encourage developers to compose smaller arrays (each of which contains contiguous memory in its leaf nodes) to create larger array structures possibly exceeding 2^31 - 1 elements, as opposed to allocating very large contiguous memory blocks.\"\r\n\r\nI think it could use a little more verbose explanation: `to compose smaller arrays to create larger array structures`",
