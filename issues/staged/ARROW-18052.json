Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are using pyarrow.parquet.write_to_dataset to write to an s3 file system in another account.\u00a0 This fails because write_to_dataset calls pyarrow.dataset.write_dataset with create_dir=True.\u00a0 There is not a parameter in the call to write_to_dataset that allows you to set create_dir to False.\u00a0 When setting it to False, this works correctly.",
