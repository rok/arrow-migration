Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nProfiling csv writer with Arm Statistical Profiling Extension (SPE) reveals there is relatively high branch misprediction rate from `memcpy`, due to interleaving copying data field and delimiter which is very short(1 or 2 chars). Copying delimiter with specific code, `memcpy` only the data field improves performance significantly.",
