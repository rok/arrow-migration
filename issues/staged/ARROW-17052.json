Please help me on the list of structures that need to expose serialize/deserialize methods? From scanning of cpp/arrow/flight/types.h and Flight.proto, I got:\u00a0\r\n\r\nTodo list:\r\n1. Action \u00a0(done, [as the first step](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13986))\u00a0\n1. ActionType\n1. Criteria\n1. Result\n1. FlightEndpoint\n1. FlightPayload \u00a0(corresponds to FlightData)\n   \n   Already have serialize/deserialize\n   ```\n   \n   BasicAuth\n   FlightDescriptor\n   Ticket\n   FlightInfo\n   ```\n   No need to add?\n   ```\n   \n   Empty\n   PutResult\n   Location \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (has Parse and a number of methods like ForGrpcTcp) \n   SchemaResult \u00a0 (has GetSchema and serialized_schema)\n   ```\n   2. And parts, like language bindings or existing use cases, for example, that are related to this change? I checked arrow-flight.\\*-test, however, I worry if I am missing something.\n   \n   Sincerely,"

The same goes for PutResult."
