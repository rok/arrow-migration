Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe TPC-H benchmarks correctly specify that all MONEY columns are DECIMAL type (precision and scale are not specified). We currently use `DataType::Float64` which is much lighter than a true Decimal type.\r\n\r\nTo be a valid benchmark we need to ensure we support the same precision as the reference implementation.",
