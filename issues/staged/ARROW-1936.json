Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLinks to KEYS, sigs and hashes must use the ASF host, not the mirrors, as such files are deliberately not mirrored.\r\n\r\ni.e. use\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/dist/arrow/KEYS\r\nhttps://www.apache.org/dist/arrow/arrow-0.8.0/apache-arrow-0.8.0.tar.gz.sha512\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe download page needs to include a link to the KEYS file (the asc file is no use without it) and should provide details of how to check sigs and hashes, for example:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi#verify\r\n",
