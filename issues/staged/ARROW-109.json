Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis was discovered when testing out recursion limit code.  It appears there is a bug in our code or a limitation in flatbuffers that a nested type  of length  ~71 doesn't round trip correctly.",
