Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the lintr flags up styling issues on every PR, which can lead to it flagging up stylistic issues on unrelated PRs if a previous R-related PR has caused a listing issue.  We should instead cause the R CI build to fail in these cases, so these problems are not merged in the first place.",
