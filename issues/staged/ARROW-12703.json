Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA DataFrame should be a valid table but not vice versa. Then one can use a Table without also pulling in all the compute functionality. We can then extend the compute functionality without incurring larger bundle sizes. Another advantage is that we could support compiled expressions in the compute code but people could build bundles without it that run on environments with CSP. ",
