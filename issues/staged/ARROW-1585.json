Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis roundtrip fails, since the Integer column isn't converted to a string after deserializing\n\n```python\nIn [1]: import pandas as pd\nim\nIn [2]: import pyarrow as pa\n\nIn [3]: pa.deserialize_pandas(pa.serialize_pandas(pd.DataFrame({\"0\": [1, 2]}))).columns\nOut[3]: Index(['0'], dtype='object')\n```\n\nThat should be an ` Int64Index([0]) ` for the columns.",

Being able to reconstruct the original from the metadata is sufficient."
