Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow ARROW-9658 and ARROW-9893 are in, we can explore using the `pyarrow.dataset` writing capabilities in `parquet.write_to_dataset`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly as was done in `pq.read_table`, we could initially have a keyword to switch between both implementations, eventually defaulting to the new datasets one, and to deprecated the old (inefficient) python implementation.",
