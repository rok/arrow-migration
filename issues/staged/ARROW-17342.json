Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13811\r\n\r\n- We should ensure all types are tested\n- We should organize tests in a way that Parquet, IPC, and eventually CSV/ORC can mostly share test code (save for perhaps skipping/overriding specific format-type pairs)\n  \n  Incidentally: it may be good to incrementally port this module to JUnit5 and drop JUnit4",
