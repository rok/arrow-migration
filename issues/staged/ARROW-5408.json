        "title": "[Rust] Create struct array builder that creates null buffers",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5408](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5408). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently have a way of creating a struct array from a list of (field, array) tuples. This does not create null buffers for the struct (because no index is null). While this works fine for Rust, it often leads to incompatible data with IPC data and kernel function outputs.\r\n\r\nHaving a function that caters for nulls, or expanding the current one, would alleviate this issue.",
