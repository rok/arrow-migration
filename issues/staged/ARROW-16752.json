        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16752](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16752). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/jeroen/V8/blob/master/configure#L17-L35 and https://github.com/jeroen/V8/blob/gh-pages/get-v8-linux.sh#L10-L41 for reference, though we'll do this in nixlibs.R not bash.\r\n\r\n- Rather than switching on distro-version and maintaining a csv map of compatible versions,  check for the features of the current system.\n- Check arch before downloading and only download for x86 (until some future time when we build arm or other binaries).\n- Check if C++ compiler is gcc < 5, use centos 7 gcc 4.8 binary for that case\n- Else, check for openssl and curl, bail if not found (non-centos7 binaries require them for aws-sdk support)\n- Else, check `openssl version`, use ubuntu 22.04 if openssl >= 3, else use ubuntu 18.04\n- Add an allowlist of distro id that has binary downloading by default (V8 downloads static libs by default on ubuntu and centos); this should perhaps download from a URL so that we can add/remove distros from the list based on feedback from the wild (and if download of that list fails, we can't download a binary anyway, so this would double as a test for whether we have a network connection)\n",
