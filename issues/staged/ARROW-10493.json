Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I try writing a column of type `struct(string)` that has more elements than the write_batch_size, the output will only contain the first batch, repeated. The data in batches after the first batch are not written to the output.\r\n\r\nI am only seeing this behaviour with arrow 2.0.0, in 1.0.1 the output contains all the data as expected.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis python test case reproduces the problem, the last value in the output is \"key-0\" instead of the expected \"key-1024\":\r\n\u00a0\r\n```python\n\r\nimport io\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\ndef test_struct_array():\r\n    default_writer_batch_size = 1024\r\n    n_samples = default_writer_batch_size + 1\r\n    keys = [f\"key-{i}\" for i in range(n_samples)]\r\n    expected = list(keys)\r\n\r\n    struct_array = pa.StructArray.from_arrays(\r\n        [pa.array(keys, type=pa.string())],\r\n        names=[\"string\"],\r\n    )\r\n    table = pa.table({\"struct\": struct_array})\r\n\r\n    buf = io.BytesIO()\r\n    pq.write_table(table, buf)\r\n\r\n    actual = pq.read_table(buf).flatten()[0].to_pylist()\r\n\r\n    assert actual[:1024] == expected[:1024]\r\n    assert actual[-1] == expected[-1], (actual[-1], expected[-1])\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",
