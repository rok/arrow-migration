There exist many applications where ones want to store small vectors/matrices with known static dimensions (i.e. 3d vector, 3d affine transform). The fixed size Arrow column format is ideal for that kind of purpose, and then allow to write high-performance code on this kind of storage.\r\n\r\nBut in order to be possible to write this kind of high perf. pipelines base on PyArrow, one needs to be able to extract the full 2D Numpy array from the PyArrow object. Technically, it is possible as shown by the small example in ARROW-8010, but it would be probably valuable to be part of the official API.\r\n\r\nIs the `to_numpy` the right place to implement it? I am not sure, I probably don't have the depth of view on this project to have a good opinion. But I believe there are numerous pure Numpy computation pipeline based on PyArrow in-memory storage which would benefit from a \"closer to metal\" Numpy API, independent of the Pandas-like series representation."
