Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI haven't fully investigated this yet, but I have found that while compression (e.g. ZSTD) is respected in DoPut requests on the client side, it does not appear to propagate through DoGet requests. This may be a bug or by design, but I think it should be possible for the client to request that compression be employed when serving a DoGet",

In this case setting write options for DoGet doesn't make much sense as you're not writing any Arrow data. That is confusing/inconvenient, but building negotiation into Flight is a separate task (did we file a Jira for that/should we just use this one?)."

Compression can be specified server-side, but there's no built-in negotiation (and in ARROW-10351 it's been hard to find a case where compression is beneficial). Or else we can adjust this JIRA to be about implementing negotiation."
