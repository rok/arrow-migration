        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7202](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7202). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRemove the `--rmdeps` arg to makepkg-mingw so that they don't get cleaned up. Then you can copy the relevant ones from `/mingw64/lib` / `/mingw32/lib` (see https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nealrichardson/arrow/builds/28875888?fullLog=true#L1134) when building the package in the followup script, rather than wget them all again later (and have to worry about version numbers, repositories, etc.). \r\n\r\nNote that relatedly, if we build libs during the arrow build (like uriparser), we can copy the .a files that get built from the build directory (which also gets deleted) to `${MINGW_PREFIX}/lib` so that we can package them up later.",
