        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16329](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16329). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen errors are propagated through the JNI barrier, two mechanisms are involved:\r\n\r\n- the `Status CheckException(JNIEnv* env)` function for Java-to-C++ error translation\n- the `JniAssertOkOrThrow(arrow::Status status)` and `T JniGetOrThrow(arrow::Result<T> result)` functions for C++-to-Java error translation\n  \n  Currently, both mechanisms lose most context about the original error, such as its type and any additional state, such as the optional `StatusDetail` in C++ or any properties in Java (which I'm sure exist on some exception classes).\n  \n  We should improve these mechanisms to retain as much context as possible. For example, in a hypothetical Java-to-C++-to-Java error propagation scenario, the original Java exception from inner code should ideally be re-thrown in the outer Java context (we already support this in Python btw).",
