        "title": "[Python] IO functions should raise FileNotFoundError when appropriate",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7282](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7282). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI get the following error when trying to open a file that does not exist.\r\n\r\n```\r\n pyarrow.lib.ArrowIOError: Failed to open local file 'filename', error: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this particular error should also subclass from Python FileNotFoundError. It currently only inherits from IOError (which is a superclass of FileNotFoundError).\r\n\r\n```\r\n >>> import pyarrow\r\n >>> try:\r\n ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 raise pyarrow.lib.ArrowIOError\r\n ... except IOError:\r\n ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pass\r\n ... \r\n >>> try:\r\n ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 raise pyarrow.lib.ArrowIOError\r\n ... except FileNotFoundError:\r\n ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 print('caught')\r\n ... \r\n Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\r\n pyarrow.lib.ArrowIOError\r\n >>> try:\r\n ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 raise pyarrow.lib.ArrowIOError\r\n ... except IOError:\r\n ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 print('caught')\r\n ... \r\n caught\r\n ```",
