Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`BufferLedger` has a `HistoricalLog` which records stack traces at various events in the buffer's life, such as when it was first allocated and upon incrementing/decrementing reference counts. While somewhat of an implementation detail, this information is useful for debugging, especially for tracking down memory leaks. We could document it (with a suitable warning).\r\n\r\nHowever, the stack trace is less useful than it first appears because it accidentally truncates the log. We should fix that too.",
