Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe nightly pandas-master tests are failing (eg https://circleci.com/gh/ursa-labs/crossbow/6815?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link) due to the deprecation of `pandas.util.testing` in pandas. \r\n\r\nThis deprecation gives a lot of warnings (which we should solve), but also some errors because the deprecations was not fully done properly on the pandas side, opened https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/30735 for this (will be fixed shortly)",
