Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\nmtcars %>%\r\n  group_by(cyl) %>%\r\n  mutate(x = hp - mean(hp)\r\n```\r\n\r\nessentially means something like\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nmtcars %>%\r\n  left_join(mtcars %>%\r\n    group_by(cyl) %>%\r\n    summarize(tmp = mean(hp))\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  mutate(x = hp - tmp) %>%\r\n  select(-tmp)\r\n```\r\n\r\nApparently you can do the same inside summarize() too (though IDK if that's behavior we want to encourage). Once we can do joins, we can support these queries.",

            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13926?focusedCommentId=17413185) by Ian Cook (icook):*\nFWIW, this is perhaps better construed as an implicit **window function**\u00a0(i.e. an OVER expression in SQL). When you do this type of operation with dbplyr, the SQL it generates uses an OVER expression:\r\n```java\n\r\nmtcars_db <- dbplyr::memdb_frame(mtcars)\r\nmtcars_db %>%\r\n  group_by(cyl) %>%\r\n  transmute(x = hp - mean(hp)) %>%\r\n  show_query()\r\n\r\n#> <SQL>\r\n#> SELECT `hp` - AVG(`hp`) OVER (PARTITION BY `cyl`) AS `x`\r\n#> FROM `dbplyr_002`\n```"
