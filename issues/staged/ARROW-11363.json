Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI tried to update Homebrew's version of gRPC at <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/69649>.\u00a0However, CI reported build failures from Apache Arrow.\r\n\r\nAmong the reported errors include: \r\n`error: implicit instantiation of undefined template`\r\n`error: incomplete definition of type`\r\n`error: implicit instantiation of undefined template`\r\n\r\nComplete CI run logs available at <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/actions/runs/506756245>.\r\n\r\nWill Apache Arrow be compatible with the latest version of gRPC? (As an aside, the lack of compatibility with LLVM 11 is also blocking Homebrew from packaging it for Apple M1.)",
