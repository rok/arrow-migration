Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, only a default extension-id-registry is supported (under arrow/engine/substrait). Modifying this registry has global effects, which is often undesirable. Support for nesting extension-id-registries will provide scoping for such modifications.",
