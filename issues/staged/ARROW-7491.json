Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAligning is an important and frequent operation when writing IPC data. It writes no more than 7 0 bytes to the output. \r\nThe current implementation creates a new byte array each time, leading to performance overhead, and increases the GC pressure. \r\n\r\nWe improve it by means of a shared byte array. Benchmark evaluation shows a 11% performance gain. ",
