Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now the `as_schema()` method isn't used in many places and doesn't support many object types. It is probably a good fit for sanitizing arguments where a schema is expected and likely has more classes that can be interpreted in this way (e.g., Field or DataType as identified in ARROW-16444). After ARROW-16444, the internal `in_type_as_schema()` function used to sanitize the `in_type` argument of `register_scalar_function()` may be a good candidate for this.",
