Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile Arrow is in development, users may install libarrow in locations other than /usr/local (especially building both release and debug builds) \u2013 for this to work without `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` additions the rpath needs to be configured. \n\nAs part of this I'll add basic installation instructions for Python users on Linux and OS X.
