Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently converting a Table of RecordBatch with an ExtensionType array to pandas gives:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nArrowNotImplementedError: No known equivalent Pandas block for Arrow data of type extension<arrow.py_extension_type> is known.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd similarly converting the array itself to a python object (to_pandas or to_pylist) gives an ArrowNotImplementedError or a \"KeyError: 28\"\r\n\r\nInitial support could be to fall back to the storage type.",
