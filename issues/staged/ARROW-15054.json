Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhether for tables/arrays, slicing and then calling `nbytes` will return the value for the whole struct. I don't know if this is a bug or the desired behaviour (and if it is I would argue that it should return a result relative to the slice, and also ask if there is any way to get the memory size of my slice?).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow\r\n\r\npyarrow.__version__\r\n\r\n>>> 6.0.0\r\n\r\ntable = pyarrow.Table.from_arrays([pyarrow.array(['foo', 'bar', 'qux'], type=pyarrow.string())], names=[\"a\"])\r\n\r\ntable.num_rows\r\n\r\n>>> 3\r\n\r\ntable.nbytes\r\n\r\n>>> 25\r\n\r\ntable.slice(0, 2).num_rows\r\n\r\n>>> 2\r\n\r\ntable.slice(0, 2).nbytes\r\n\r\n>>> 25\r\n\r\n```",
