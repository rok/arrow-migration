        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6407). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis will prevent issues like ARROW-6406\r\n\r\nAfter ARROW-8266 ensures every _ep has at least two URLs this problem becomes harder since we have a few classes of URL which don't necessarily overlap: preferred (highest priority during build configuration), canonical (whence new tarballs should be downloaded when versions get bumped), and backup. It's difficult to represent this in a txt file.\r\n\r\nA script should be available for automatically bumping versions (a generalization of upload-boost.sh):\r\n- update versions.txt, including checksums\n- run download_dependencies.sh to get fresh archives\n- run (or inline) trim-boost.sh to trim the boost archive\n- update ursalabs-managed archives: https://github.com/ursa-labs/thirdparty/releases/tag/latest\n  \n  \n  Checksums:\n  \n  If a checksum is not provided to ExternalProject_Add it may re-download a tarball even if that's not necessary (any time the generated build must be modified, IIUC). Ideally we should provide a checksum for all _eps (and not just Thrift) to cut down on unnecessary network access when building bundled.\n  \n  ARROW-8222 introduces a subtlety: we now default to a trimmed boost archive which contains only the 10% which we need, only falling back to a full boost archive when that fails to download. This is faster but not equivalent to the full boost archive so we can't provide a single checksum which matches both. This will probably just mean that those cases are extra slow",
