Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowup to ARROW-9964. Consider the simple CSV (well, one column so there's no comma needed)\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n\"time\"\r\n\"23/09/2020\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I specify the column as type timestamp, I can provide a timestamp_parser to parse it. But if I specify it as date32, the timestamp_parsers don't get invoked and I get an error.\r\n",
