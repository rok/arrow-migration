        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14336](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14336). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe CMake scripts for the Arrow C++ library download bundled third-party dependencies from\u00a0<https://github.com/ursa-labs/thirdparty/releases/>. Consider maintaining these in an ASF-managed location (probably http://apache.jfrog.io) instead of an Ursa Labs / Voltron Data-managed location. This would make it possible for Arrow committers / PMC members outside of Ursa / Voltron to upload new versions of these dependency tarballs (like in\u00a0ARROW-14229).",
