        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11083](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11083). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe build \"Source Release and Merge Script\" is currently broken with the following error:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\r\n \u00a0dotnet-sdk-2.2 : Depends: aspnetcore-runtime-2.2 (>= 2.2.7) but it is not going to be installed\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Depends: dotnet-runtime-2.2 (>= 2.2.7) but it is not going to be installed\r\n E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\r\n```\r\n when running\r\n```java\n\r\n \u00a0 wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb\r\n \u00a0 sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb\r\n \u00a0 sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https\r\n \u00a0 sudo apt-get update\r\n \u00a0 sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect that the reason this is not showing up in master is that this execution is behind a docker layer and therefore not triggered.",
