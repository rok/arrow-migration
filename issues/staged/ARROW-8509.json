Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi All,\r\n\r\nI am working on integrating two programs, both of which are using Plasma API. For this purpose, I need to convert RecordBatches to Buffer to transfer to Plasma.\r\n\r\nI have created GArrowRecordBatch <-> GArrowBuffer conversion functions which are working for me locally, but I am not sure if I have adopted the correct way, I want it to be integrated into c_glib. Can you people please check these functions and update/accept the pull request?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6963",

So the serialize function should receive an output buffer instead of creating a buffer internally and returning it.\r\n\r\nFor deserialize function, we should implement it as a method for `GArrowBuffer` not `GArrowRecordBatch`.\r\n\r\nHow about the following API?\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n/* c_glib/arrow-glib/record-batch.{cpp,h} */\r\ngboolean \r\ngarrow_record_batch_serialize(GArrowRecordBatch *record_batch, GArrowBuffer *output, GError **error);\r\n\r\n/* c_glib/arrow-glib/buffer.{cpp,h} */\r\nGArrowRecordBatch * \r\ngarrow_buffer_deserialize_record_batch(GArrowBuffer *buffer, GArrowSchema *schema, GError **error);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBTW, do you want to complete this feature? Or you just share your request? (Do you want someone to complete this feature?) It seems that you didn't run our tests with your change. (Our CI shows your change causes a build error.)"

You'll be able to learn how to develop Apache Arrow GLib with my change such as how to write tests.
