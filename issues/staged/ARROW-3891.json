Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nthe `public int isSet(int index)` routine checks if the bit is set by calling Long.bitCount function. This is unnecessary and creates performance degradation. This can simply be replaced by bit shift and bitwise & operation.\u00a0\r\n\r\n`return Long.bitCount(b & (1L << bitIndex));`\r\n\r\nto\u00a0\r\n\r\n`return (b >> bitIndex) & 0x01;`\u00a0",
