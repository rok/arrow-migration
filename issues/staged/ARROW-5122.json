        "title": "[Python] pyarrow.parquet.read_table raises non-file path error when given a windows path to a directory",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5122](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5122). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI think this might be a small bug with the read_table interface when used to load a directory full of parquets in Windows. It works just fine if I use directly a ParquetDataset object to read the table represented by the directory, or if I use `read_table` in a linux terminal.\r\n\r\nApparently the problem comes from the `_make_manifest()` method in `parquet.py`, I think around line ~1045. Either `_is_path_like()` or the FileSystem method `isdir()` fail to recognize the path as a valid directory (I tested with a raw Windows path and a `pathlib.WindowsPath` object).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps a little.\r\n\r\nP.D. Thank you for your effort developing this package!",
