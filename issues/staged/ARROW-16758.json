        "title": "[C++] Rewrite ExecuteScalarExpression to not use ScalarExecutor",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16758](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16758). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`ExecuteScalarExpression` sets up and tears down `ScalarExecutor` from exec.cc for each node in the expression tree. This adds a ton of overhead from moving around non-trivial objects. After ARROW-16756, we should write a new ScalarExpressionExecutor which is careful to construct ArraySpans and execute the expression tree in a much more lightweight / less bloated fashion. \r\n\r\nFollow on work in a subsequent Jira will add a pool/stack of allocated temporary buffers to reuse during execution ",
