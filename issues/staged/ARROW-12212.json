Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowup to ARROW-10734. Setting up a solaris vm on github actions may be possible. We can try to setup https://github.com/vmactions/solaris-vm with R from https://files.r-hub.io/opencsw/. A temporary solution could be a nightly r-hub build kicked off by the arrow-r-nightly CI; it would email me with the results. Not ideal but it would at least alert us to issues closer to when they are merged and not just at release time.",
