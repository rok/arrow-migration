Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should provide docker image and a docker file that contains all necessary dependencies that one needs for development. In addition there should be a Dockerfile that can be used for development where the sources are (bind-)mounted into the container. A typical workflow should consist out of a wrapper script that starts the container, takes care of the bind mounts and runs cmake if necessary.\r\n\r\nPeople that want to get started with Arrow development on e.g. OS X will spend a long time setting up the environment. I hope this lowers the barrier for a first contribution a bit.",

Otherwise we're quite open on how this would work. The difficulty will be to have an image that can be run and do incremental builds in a persisted volumne or bind mount. Non-incremental builds would make it unusable for developing."
