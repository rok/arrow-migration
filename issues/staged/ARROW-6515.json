Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`IsSignedInt` takes either an array or a type as a type argument, which is surprisingly atypical for traits. Furthermore whereas `is_signed_integer` returns false for date and other types which are represented by but not identical to integers `IsSignedInt` returns true by checking only the `c_type`, which leads to `static_assert(IsSignedInt<HalfFloatType>::value, \"\")`. Finally the declaration of `IsSignedInt` is far from readable due to nested macro usage.",
