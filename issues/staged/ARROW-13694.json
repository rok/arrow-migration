Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI encounter a fatal error with the new version of Arrow R (5.0.0) that I did not have with its older version (4.0.1). Basically, after running \"open_dataset\", I filter and collect the data into a dataframe; then RStudio crashes :\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nds <- arrow::open_dataset(sources = \"XXXX\", partitioning = c(\"XX\",\"YY\",\"ZZ\"))\r\ndf<- ds %>%\r\n filter(year >= 2014 & year <= 2020 & type %in% c(\"XX\", \"YY\") & sector == \"ABC\" & identifier %in% list_identifiers & type == \"LE\" & val == \"M\") %>%\r\n select(period, obs_value) %>%\r\ncollect()\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf I run the code above without \"filter\", I do not have any problem. I guess there is something wrong in the filtering expression.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot reproduce the exact code neither the problem. The dataset is very large and I did not understand the precise source of the error. Eveything I know is that my R Studio crashes and that this code worked perfectly in the older version of the package.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that I disabled multithreading with :\r\n```java\n\r\noptions(arrow.use_threads = FALSE)\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Only other thing I can suggest is to try \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nset_cpu_count(1)\r\nset_io_thread_count(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems there are other places that have separate multithreading controls. See if setting one of these makes the crash stop, that might give us a clue."

I would be delighted if I could replicate the issue, but unfortunately the dataset I use is very large and I cannot share it.\r\n\r\nI tested with your settings, but it does not change and RStudio keeps crashing. If I isolate some filtering expressions, for instance, I only run\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ndf<- ds %>%\r\n filter(year >= 2014 & year <= 2020 & type %in% c(\"XX\", \"YY\") & type == \"LE\" & val == \"M\") %>%\r\n select(period, obs_value) %>%\r\ncollect()\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nthis works without error. However, if add to the code\r\n```java\n\r\nidentifier %in% list_identifiers & sector %in% (list_sectors)\r\n```\r\nthen I have a crash. Please note that list_identifiers is a large list (approx. 168MB), but list_sectors it is not. With the version 4.0.1, the code run smoothly.\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can get the RStudio Log (I have a basic user account) ?\r\n\r\n\u00a0"

Does it require both identifier %in% and sector %in% to crash (i.e. if you add one or the other it is fine, but it crashes with both)? \r\n\r\nAlso, it looks like you're running 32-bit R. Is there a reason you can't run the 64-bit R? I would guess that it works on 64-bit."

If I only run\r\n```java\n\r\ndf<- ds %>%\r\n filter(year >= 2014 & year <= 2020 & type %in% c(\"XX\", \"YY\") & type == \"LE\" & val == \"M\")\n```\r\nI do not have a crash. However, if I add collect(), then the crash occurs.\r\n\r\nOn your second point, the crash does not require both filtering expressions (identifier %in% or sector %in%). I've tested all combinations, with no change in behaviour.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nConcerning your third point, I confirm you that I am running R 64bit as following :\r\n```java\n\r\n> Sys.info()[[\"machine\"]]\r\n\r\n[1] \"x86-64\"\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFinally, I've tested the same code and the same dataset on a Mac 64bit. I have no crash there.\r\n\r\nHere is what I found out in the Security and Maintenance Control Panel (after R/ RStudio crashes):\r\n```java\n\r\nFaulting Module Name : C:\\Users\\Public\\R\\4.0\\RPackages\\arrow\\libs\\x64\\arrow.dll\r\nException Code : 0xc0000005\r\n```\r\n\u00a0"
