Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nlibarrow build succeeds, but\u00a0include/arrow/csv/type_fwd.h isn't installed since 4.0.0. This causes R install.packages('arrow') to fail with:\r\n```java\n\r\nmake: *** [/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf:179: array.o] Error 1\r\nIn file included from recordbatch.cpp:18:\r\n././arrow_types.h:37:10: fatal error: 'arrow/csv/type_fwd.h' file not found\n```\r\nReproduced with Ubuntu 18.04 and with macOS 10.13.6 MacPorts with both apache-arrow-4.0.0 and current HEAD\u00a0f959141ece4d660bce5f7fa545befc0116a7db79.\r\n\r\nNo other\u00a0type_fwd.h are missing:\r\n```java\n\r\nfind .../arrow/cpp/src -name type_fwd.h | wc -l\r\n10\r\nfind .../include -name type_fwd.h | wc -l\r\n9\n```\r\nBest guess: default value of cmake ARROW_CSV changed and R arrow requires\u00a0ARROW_CSV=ON.",

WIth further testing, I find that:\r\n\r\n\u2022 R apache-arrow-3.0.0 builds and works on Ubuntu 18.04, R 4.0.3, devtools:\r\n```java\n\r\ninstall_github('apache/arrow',subdir='r',ref='apache-arrow-3.0.0',clean=T,force=T)\u00a0\n```\r\n\u2022 R apache-arrow-4.0.0 and current HEAD builds but crashes on use on\u00a0Ubuntu 18.04, e.g.:\r\n```java\n\r\n> x=read_feather('test.ftr')\r\nError in io___MemoryMappedFile__Open(path, mode) :\r\n Cannot call io___MemoryMappedFile__Open(). See https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html for help installing Arrow C++ libraries.\u00a0\r\n```\r\n\u2022 R apache-arrow-1.0.1 builds and works on macOS 10.13.6, R 4.0.4, devtools:\r\n```java\n\r\ninstall_github('apache/arrow',subdir='r',ref='apache-arrow-1.0.1',clean=T,force=T)\n```\r\n\u2022 R HEAD, apache-arrow-4.0.0, 3.0.0 (and probably 2.0.0) don't build on macOS\u00a010.13.6, R 4.0.4, devtools because of\u00a0ARROW_CSV=OFF\r\n\r\n\u2022 If I build and install libarrow apache-arrow-4.0.0\u00a0with ARROW_CSV=ON first, then R\u00a0apache-arrow-4.0.0 builds and works (because it uses already installed libarrow) on macOS 10.13.6, R 4.0.4, devtools\r\n\r\nBy hypothesis, I could also skip libarrow and manually build only R arrow with ARROW_CSV=ON.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
