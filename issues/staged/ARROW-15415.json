        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15415](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15415). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile trying to create a debug build of Arrow on Windows using vcpkg and MSVC, I encountered a few issues with the current build configuration:\r\n\r\n1. Python debug and release libraries are passed, but our Cmake scripts only expect one or the other. Just as reported in ARROW-13470\n1. Since vcpkg upgraded gtest to 1.11.0, there is again a mismatch between the bundled gtest and the vcpkg versions. So we get the same error as was found in ARROW-14393\n1. Thrift could not find debug static libraries, because it was missing the \"d\" suffix. It should be `libthriftmdd.lib`, but was finding `libthriftmd.lib`.\n   \n   Additionally, the recommended `clcache` program from our Windows developer docs is no longer maintained. I found its dependency `pyuv` doesn't install on Windows anymore, and is also no longer maintained.",

Doesn't solve all issues on MSVC + vcpkg, but is enough to get me a basic build."
