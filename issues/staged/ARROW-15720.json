Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis failure is triggered by a change in Arrow (addition of `types_mapper` keyword to `pa.Array.to_pandas`), but the cause is a wrong usage of that in dask.\r\n\r\nI already fixed that on the dask side: https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/8733\r\n\r\nBut we should still skip the test on our side (will be needed until that PR is merged + released)",
