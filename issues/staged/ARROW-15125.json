        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15125](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15125). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe social media link preview image (a.k.a. social share image) for the Arrow site looks really really bad when displayed on Twitter with dark mode switched on:\r\n\r\n![image-2021-12-15-21-18-51-137.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13037547/image-2021-12-15-21-18-51-137.png)\r\n\r\nI don't know whether this affects the preview image on other social media sites.\r\n\r\nThis is happening because the preview image is a transparent PNG image with black content on a transparent background, and the background becomes black in dark mode, leaving barely visible black on black.\r\n\r\nI believe the preview image is controlled by these\u00a0`<meta>` elements (depending on which social media site the preview is displayed on):\r\n```java\n\r\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow.png\">\r\n<meta property=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow.png\">\n```\r\nI think the simplest way to fix this would be to point these `<meta>` elements to a PNG image with an opaque white background.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's also possible to specify separate social share images for light and dark mode, but I'm not sure about that.",
