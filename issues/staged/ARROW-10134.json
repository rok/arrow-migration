Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/6534#issuecomment-699512602, comment by `[~rjzamora]`:\r\n\r\n>  it would be great to have access the total row-group count for the fragment from a `num_row_groups` attribute (which pyarrow should be able to get without parsing all row-group metadata/statistics - I think?).\r\n\r\nOne question is: does this attribute correspond to the row groups in the parquet file, or the (subset of) row groups represented by the fragment? \r\nI expect the second (so if you do SplitByRowGroup, you would get a fragment with num_row_groups==1), but this might be a potential confusing aspect of the attribute.",

This would also allow using `f.whole_file_fragment == f` to check for subselection"

That's maybe simpler as a `whole_file_fragment` and covers an important example use case you gave for `whole_file_fragment`"
