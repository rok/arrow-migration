        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11736](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11736). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Solaris build fails to build `libarrow_bundled_dependencies.a` because of some mismatch of arguments to the `ar` command: \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n[ 19%] Bundling /export/home/XnknpBn/Rtemp/RtmpBOhxfH/file66df7a592ae4/release/libarrow_bundled_dependencies.a\r\ngmake[2]: Entering directory '/export/home/XnknpBn/Rtemp/RtmpBOhxfH/file66df7a592ae4'\r\nusage: ar -d[-SvV] archive file ...\r\n       ar -m[-abiSvV] [posname] archive file ...\r\n       ar -p[-vV][-sS] archive [file ...]\r\n       ar -q[-cuvSV] [-abi] [posname] [file ...]\r\n       ar -r[-cuvSV] [-abi] [posname] [file ...]\r\n       ar -t[-vV][-sS] archive [file ...]\r\n       ar -x[-vV][-sSCT] archive [file ...]\r\ngmake[2]: *** [src/arrow/CMakeFiles/arrow_bundled_dependencies.dir/build.make:61: release/libarrow_bundled_dependencies.a] Error 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf ARROW_PARQUET=OFF (ARROW-11735), the only dependencies to bundle are re2 and utf8proc. So we could either fix the `ar` invocation, or we could make re2 and utf8proc optional. Build-wise, they are optional, but we have some tests that call the string kernels, and we'd need to know that they should be skipped (i.e. another option in `skip_if_not_available()`.",
