The actual release tags are tested, but the testing is mostly the same as the nightly CI + some manual verification for the release vote. (Hence, for old CentOS, there's no difference unless someone decides to bring up an old CentOS - perhaps we should just add it to nightly CI.)\r\n\r\nFor the googletest issue, I think CMake should dump a log with more information."
