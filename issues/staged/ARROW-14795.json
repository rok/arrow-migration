Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm working in ARROW-1699\u00a0and using the method\u00a0**`ReplaceWithArrayMask`**\u00a0for replace the nulls using a generated mask, but the method gave me unexpected results when the input Array contains nulls and this nulls are replaced with values.\r\nWhen testing this special Test on\u00a0**vector_test_replace_test.cc**\r\n```java\n\r\nthis->Assert(ReplaceWithMask, this->array(\"[1, null, 1]\"),\r\n   this->mask(\"[false, true, false]\"),\r\n   this->array(\"[7]\"),\r\n   this->array(\"[1, 7, 1]\"));\n```\r\nThe result is:\r\n```java\n\r\nActual:\r\n[\r\n1,\r\nnull,\r\n1\r\n]\n```\r\nAnd\u00a0 debugging the code, the output values is correct, but the null_bitmap isn't updated and keep the original null_bitmap\r\nIn the file\u00a0**`vector_replace.cc`**\u00a0 on line 202, the bitmap is updated only for turnoff the null replacement values\r\n![image-2021-11-22-15-51-30-120.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13036465/image-2021-11-22-15-51-30-120.png)\r\nThis is and expected behavior or an issue on\u00a0**`ReplaceWithArrayMask`**\u00a0?\u00a0",
