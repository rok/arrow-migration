We could keep that property (the null bitmap is usually much smaller than the actual data, so the initial memset may not cost much), which has the nice side effect of making output deterministic.\r\n\r\n`BooleanBuilder` also memsets its raw data to 0. The same reasoning may apply as for the null bitmap (is it customary to have huge boolean arrays?)."
