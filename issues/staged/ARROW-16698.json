        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16698). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be helpfully to be able to read first N rows of feather file.\r\ne.g. \u00a0[read_feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.feather.read_feather.html)\u00a0or\u00a0[read_table](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.feather.read_table.html) could have \"nrows\" argument that behaves like \"nrows\" argument in [pd.read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html)\u00a0\r\n\r\nmy particular use case is to development and test my data jobs. Say I saved a large data file(s) in feather format. For development, I don't want to read all rows but just first few rows of data to make sure my code runs.\r\n\r\nI suppose there are many other use-cases.\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/wesm/feather/issues/158",
