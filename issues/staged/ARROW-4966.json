        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4966](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4966). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen reading some ORC files, pyarrow orc throws the following error on `read()`:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\no = pf.read()\n```\r\n`terminate called after throwing an instance of 'orc::TimezoneError'`\r\n `what(): Can't open /usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT-00:00`\r\n\r\nWhile it's true this folder does not exist, I don't think it normally does. Our server has folders for `GMT`, `GMT0`, `GMT-0`, and `GMT+0`.\r\n\r\nORC file was created using HIVE, compressed with Snappy. Other files from the same table/partition do not throw this error. Files can be read with Hive.\r\n\r\nWe created a soft link from the existing `GMT` timezone to this one, and it fixed the issue. Then shortly I got the same error, but for `GMT+00:00`... :D\u00a0Soft link fixed this one also.",
