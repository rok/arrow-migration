Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile working in integration tests of parquet2 against pyarrow, I noticed that page statistics are only written by pyarrow when using version 1.\r\n\r\nI do not have an easy way to reproduce this within pyarrow as I am not sure how to access individual pages from a column chunk, but it is something that I observe when trying to integrate.\r\n\r\nThe row group stats are still written, this only affects page statistics.\r\n\r\npyarrow call:\r\n\r\n```\r\npa.parquet.write_table(\r\n        t,\r\n        path,\r\n        version=\"2.0\",\r\n        data_page_version=\"2.0\",\r\n        write_statistics=True,\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nchanging version to \"1.0\" does not impact this behavior, suggesting that the specific option causing this behavior is the data_page_version=\"2.0\".\r\n",
