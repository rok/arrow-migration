Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi, team.\r\n\r\nI'm ZhaoBo from Openlab, a worker for making more opensource projects can run on ARM. Here I wanna to ask some questions in ARROW community. Thanks\r\n\r\n1. Is there any plan for supporting ARM release in community?\r\n\r\n2. And I found\u00a0\u00a0[https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3010#issuecomment-441091047](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3010#issuecomment-441091047))\u00a0that `[~guyuqi]` \u00a0proposed, what status about the ARM support? Could you please tell some details to me?\r\n\r\n3. I found current CI system doesn't integrate any ARM test. If community wants to make test on ARM work, what's the plan? Using the travis-ci for ARM support or other ways?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso, that's pretty great if `[~guyuqi]` \u00a0could tell me the status and the following plan. ;)\u00a0. This issue will trace the whole work flow for ARM. Thank you\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

(But they aren't available with `apt`/`yum` because of APT/Yum repository configuration mistake in 0.15.)\r\n\r\nTravis CI's ARM support will be a good choice for now. We can use amd64 VM to run ARM test with QEMU. But QEMU is slow."

So our community haven't release the ARM release for these situation right now? ;)\r\n\r\nTravis ARM CI is in alpha testing release now. So I guess it is hard for fitting current requests for now. But I think that will become more stable and powerful in the future."

I'm pretty understanding that ARROW is a busy project, and most part of developers may cover so many projects or so many features to be done. Personally, I think arrow is the only way which must be passed to make more apache projects running and testing on ARM, especially on BIG DATA area. So I plan to discuss with our team to make a plan and the following thing for the real ARM invest, including ARM testing workers and human resources.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks again."

We found there is no any way to use arrow directly in ARROW DOC or some blogs. Such as we use ubuntu-1804, but the installation doc only gives us a x86 apt repo. Could you / arrow team please to help to build the packages for ARM? Thank you very much."
