        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17289](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17289). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n~~Currently, type categories are only available as vectors, e.g., the category of integer types is available via `arrow::IntTypes()`. This issue will add type category membership test, e.g. `arrow::IsIntType(type)`.~~\r\n\r\nFollowing discussions, this issue ended up covering the following:\r\n \\* Additional type category predicates\r\n \\* Convenience predicates accepting a `DataType` parameter\r\n \\* Documentation and testing of the predicates",

Given a `std::shared_ptr<DataType> type`, it's easy for the user to find `IsIntegerType(type)`. IIUC, using `type_traits.h` the code would be `is_integer(type->id())`, which has one more function that the user needs to find. Granted, I overlooked that the proposed implementation could be simplified using the type id.\r\n\r\nRegarding documentation, when I search for \"apache arrow type is integer\", the top results are <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/data-type.html,> <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/data-type.html,> followed by PyArrow results. Adding \"C++\" to the search doesn't change the results much."
