        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1410](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1410). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe problem can be reproduced as follows. First start a plasma store with\n\n```Java\nplasma_store -s /tmp/s1 -m 500000000000\n```\n\nThen continuously put in objects using a script like the following.\n\n```Java\nimport pyarrow.plasma as plasma\nimport numpy as np\n\nclient = plasma.connect('/tmp/s1', '', 0)\n\nfor i in range(20000):\n    print(i)\n    object_id = plasma.ObjectID(np.random.bytes(20))\n    client.create(object_id, np.random.randint(0, 100000000))\n    client.seal(object_id)\n```\n\nAs the loop counters are being printed, you will see long pauses. The problem is the fact that we are mmapping pages with the MAP_POPULATE flag. Though this can be used to improve performance of subsequent object creations, it isn't worth the long pauses. We may want to find a way to populate the pages in the background.",
