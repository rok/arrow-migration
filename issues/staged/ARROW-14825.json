        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14825](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14825). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently support `epi_week()` via the `us_week` kernel.  Can we support `epi_year()` too?\r\n\r\nepiyear in lubridate:\r\nhttps://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate/blob/10731d1876f8cb902f01f8edb2810a09ce5784a4/R/accessors-year.r#L48-L69\r\n\r\nI think this might be somewhat similar to MySQL's `yearweek`.  It doesn't seem to be implemented universally, e.g. I don't think it's a thing in Postgres\r\n\r\nIf this isn't something desirable to implement at the C++ level, it's still possible to implement at the R level after a number of other temporal-related functions are implemented.",
