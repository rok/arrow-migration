        "title": "[Java] Fix VectorAppender to correctly append data buffer for BitVector",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14418](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14418). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nVectorAppender uses type-width to copy the data buffer from delta vector to target vector. But, BitVector's type-width is 0, hence, its data buffer does not get copied to the target vector. The VectorAppender should be fixed to correctly handle data buffer copy for the BitVector.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is as follows:\r\n1. The validity vector is correctly appended.\n1. The data buffer is not appended.\n   \n   \u00a0This means that is the delta vector contains 1's (true values), they are appended as false.\n   \n   e.g.\n   \n   Target BitVector = \\{1, 0, null}, and\n   \n   Delta BitVector = \\{1, 0, null}, then\n   \n   the result is \\{1, 0, null, 0, 0, null}. <== notice the fourth element is copied as 0 (or false).\n   \n   The correct result is \\{1, 0, null, 1, 0, null}.\n   \n   \u00a0",
