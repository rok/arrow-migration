        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4559](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4559). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing or reading files to or from paths that have special characters in them, (e.g., \"#\"), pyarrow returns an error:\u00a0\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nOSError: Passed non-file path...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a consequence of the following line:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/filesystem.py#L416\r\n\r\nFile-paths will be parsed as URIs, which will give strange results for filepaths like: \"bad # actor.parquet\":\r\n\r\nParseResult(scheme='', netloc='', path='/tmp/bad ', params='', query='', fragment='actor.parquet')\r\n\r\nThis is trivial to reproduce with the following code which uses the `pd.to_parquet` and `pd.read_parquet` interfaces:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nx = pd.DataFrame({\"a\": [1,2,3]})\r\nx.to_parquet(\"bad # actor.parquet\")\r\nx.read_parquet(\"bad # actor.parquet\")\r\n```\r\n",
