Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen calculating unique for chunked\u00a0DictionaryArrays we currently run through all chunks and unify their dictionaries and then collect chunk indices. We could avoid the dictionary unification by using a generic hash.\r\n\r\n[See discussion here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9683)\u00a0and [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10403)",
