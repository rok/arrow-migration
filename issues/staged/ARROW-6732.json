Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current quick sort algorithm in implemented by a recursive algorithm. The problem is that for the worst case, the number of recursive layers is equal to the length of the vector.  For large vectors, this will cause stack overflow.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we implement the quick sort algorithm as a non-recursive algorithm.",
