Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe're using `-std=c++11` in a\u00a0few non-external project places as well as setting `-fPIC`. CMake provides the `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` flag (which we are also using) and the `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` flag for setting these options in a cross platform way (where it matters).\r\n\r\nWe should use these flags instead of using platform conditional checks to set their values explicitly.",

We'll still have to pass -fPIC to some of the external projects, but we could handle that in `ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake`"
