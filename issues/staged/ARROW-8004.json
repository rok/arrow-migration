        "title": "[Python] Define API for user-defined conversions of array cell values in pyarrow.array",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8004](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8004). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nConsider the statement\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\npyarrow.array([v0, v1, v2, v3])\r\n```\r\n\r\nor correspondingly\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\npyarrow.array(pd.Series([v0, v1, v2, v3], dtype=object))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `v0, ..., v4` are instances of types with no built-in conversion-to-Arrow support in pyarrow. An API could be provided to allow user-defined unboxing to a data type that the library _does_ understand (like a NumPy array). One complexity is that if the unboxing is costly, we may need to \"keep around\" the unboxed value when doing multiple passes over the data (e.g. initially for type inference and then for conversion)",
