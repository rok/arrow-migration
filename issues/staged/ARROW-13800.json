Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn R, divide by 0 results in Inf. That maps (for floats at least) to arrow's divide, not divide_checked, which errors.\r\n\r\nSee also discussion on ARROW-13801; we may need to do special `nse_func` handling for `\\` to get this right in dplyr for integers (or maybe we already are; in any case, add some tests).",

The **checked** variants check for over/underflow behavior, and I would not classify divide-by-zero as such. I think having an option **allow_div_by_zero** is a reasonable solution with more flexibility.\r\n\r\nAlso, if at some time in the future, the **checked** variants become the default kernels in Arrow then **divide** would still have the expected behavior for such case."
