        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15839). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi ! Right now when one wants to reconstruct a ListArray using ListArrar.from_arrays, the `null` values may be lost:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\narr = pa.array([None, [0]])\r\nreconstructed_arr = pa.ListArray.from_arrays(arr.offsets, arr.values)\r\nprint(reconstructed_arr.to_pylist())\r\n# [[], [0]] \n```\r\nIt would be nice to have a `mask` parameter to `ListArray.from_arrays` (or any way to provide the validity bitmap) to be able to reconstruct the original array with the `null` values.\r\n\r\nIt would also be consistent with `StructArray.from_arrays` that already has the `mask` parameter.",
