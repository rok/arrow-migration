        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13076](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13076). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, an ExtensionTypeVector has a type constraint for the underlying storage to extend BaseValueVector. StructVector, UnionVector and DenseUnionVector do not extend this base class.\r\n\r\nAfter ARROW-13044, Union vectors will extend the ValueVector interface and the extension vector type constrain could be relaxed to this interface to allow the above vector types to be used.",
