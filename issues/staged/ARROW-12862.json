Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom Wes's suggestion on the mailing list:\r\n\r\nHaving a website\r\ndashboard showing build health over time along with a ~ weekly e-mail\r\nto dev@ indicating currently broken builds and the reliability of each\r\nbuild over the trailing 7 or 30 days would be useful. Knowing that a\r\nparticular build is only passing 20% of the time would help steer our\r\nefforts.",
