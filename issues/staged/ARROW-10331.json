Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDataFusion's errors do not have much love these days, and I think that they need a lift. For example,\r\n \\* we use \"General\" very often\r\n \\* the error is called \"ExecutionError\", even though sometimes it happens during planning\r\n \\* the error \"InvalidColumn\" is not being used\r\n \\* There is not much documentation about the errors\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
