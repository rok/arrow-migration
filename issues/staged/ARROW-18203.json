Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-17462 we added some logic to build_expr() to cast scalars in expressions to match the type of the field. It was observed in review that this was not something you'd want everywhere and you should have to opt-in to it. We should refactor our internals so that we only use build_expr() where we want this behavior, and otherwise use Expression$create() directly.",
