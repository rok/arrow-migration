        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2722](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2722). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe following snippet:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\npa.array(pd.to_numeric(pd.Series(np.array([65536,2,3], dtype=np.uint64)), downcast='unsigned'), \r\nfrom_pandas=True, type='uint32')\r\n```\r\nfails to convert with message:\r\n```\n\r\nArrowNotImplementedError Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-2-b259c5cb7044> in <module>()\r\n4 \r\n5 pa.array(pd.to_numeric(pd.Series(np.array([65536,2,3], dtype=np.uint64)), downcast='unsigned'), \r\n----> 6 from_pandas=True, type='uint32')\r\n\r\narray.pxi in pyarrow.lib.array()\r\n\r\narray.pxi in pyarrow.lib._ndarray_to_array()\r\n\r\nerror.pxi in pyarrow.lib.check_status()\r\n\r\nArrowNotImplementedError: Unsupported numpy type 6\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is a Windows 64-bit machine, running Python 3.6.5, pyarrow 0.9.0, pandas 0.23.1 and numpy 1.14.5.\r\n\r\nSeems to be fine for uint16 or uint8 downcasting. Unfortunately I didn't had the time to dig deeper or try on a Linux machine but it feels like its related to the LLP64 model.",
