If there would be a `RecordBatch::field()`, it should probably return a `Field` and not an array.\r\n\r\nOn the python side also this terminology is used: `Table.column()` returns the (chunked) array, `Table.field()` a field (as a shortcut for `Table.schema.field()`.\r\n\r\nSo I would personally close this issue."
