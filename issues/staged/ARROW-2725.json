Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-2696 improved the allocation listener, adding a function that ended up using the Accountant.AllocationOutcome. However, while AllocationOutcome is public, Accountant is package private. This limits all listeners to be members of the arrow.memory package, which seems silly.\r\n\r\nInstead, promote AllocationOutcome into a public enum within arrow.memory",
