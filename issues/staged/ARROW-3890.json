Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyarrow arrays of string cannot be created from numpy arrays of string anymore for versions pyarrow>=0.8.0 (this includes pyarrow==0.11.1).\r\n\r\nPlease find below a quick repro:\r\n```python\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nvec = np.array([\"toto\", \"tata\"])\r\npa.array(vec, pa.string())\r\n```\r\n\r\nRuning this I get the following:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nArrowInvalid                              Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-4-e753fb3a8193> in <module>()\r\n----> 1 pa.array(vec, pa.string())\r\n\r\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyarrow/lib.so in pyarrow.lib.array()\r\n\r\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyarrow/lib.so in pyarrow.lib._ndarray_to_array()\r\n\r\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyarrow/lib.so in pyarrow.lib.check_status()\r\n\r\nArrowInvalid: 'utf32' codec can't decode bytes in position 0-3: code point not in range(0x110000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this code snippet was working fine with pyarrow==0.7.1.\r\n\r\nWas there any behavior change with string in pyarrow since 0.7.1?\r\nDo you have any workaround for this?\r\n\r\nJacques\r\n\r\n\r\n",
