        "title": "[C++] RecordBatch Make() with Arrow Arrays could infer length",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17443](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17443). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, if you use ChunkedArrays to make a Table, the num_rows argument is optional \u2013 if left as-is, the Table can just figure out the amount from the ChunkedArrays, and use that to initialize the Table. If the user wants a subset, instead, the user can fill in this argument.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecordBatch, when made with Arrays, requires the number of rows to be supplied, no matter what, leading users to do things like pass arr->length() when they just want all their data.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCould RecordBatch's Array-using Make() method be changed to match the behavior of Table's ChunkedArray-using Make() method? If only for the sake of consistency?",
