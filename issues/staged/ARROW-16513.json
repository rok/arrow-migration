Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a lot of internal logic for hashing inputs and it might be nice to expose some of this to users (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72177022/how-to-get-hash-of-string-column-in-polars-or-pyarrow)\r\n\r\nThe `HashBatch` method in `key_hash.h` (not quite merged but close) is likely to be the most performant.  However, it does make some sacrifices on uniqueness of hashes in the spirit of performance (so we should make sure to document these).",
