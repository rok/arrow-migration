Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nYou can now list the available docker builds using `archery docker images`.\r\nHowever, to get details about a particular build, you have to dive into the `docker-compose.yml` file.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there were a command such as `archery docker info <image-name>` that would give some information about the build, such as:\r\n- the possible parameters for the image (such as ARCH, UBUNTU...)\n- the command(s) executed by default when running the image\n",
