Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe frequently skip [tests that depend on features that are not available](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/b9ac245afef081339093cd1930153d6b18b0479d/r/tests/testthat/helper-skip.R#L24-L34) which is nice (especially for CRAN tests, where the features might not be buildable.\r\n\r\nBut should we have a CI flag that we could turn on (that is, off by default) that forces all of these tests to be run so we can know there is at least one build that runs all the tests? AFAICT, right now if we have no CI that successfully builds parquet, for example, most of our parquet tests would silently not run.",
