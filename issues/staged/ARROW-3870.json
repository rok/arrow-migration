        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3870](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3870). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome InputStream sources support lookahead without advancing the stream, like BufferReader and BufferedInputStream. This is used in Parquet's internal IO APIs, so it would be useful to be able to remove these after a deprecation cycle\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/util/memory.h#L375\r\n\r\nIf an InputStream does not support Peek, the returned `string_view` would have zero size. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to have `Peek` return `Status`, so that NotImplemented can be returned. I would prefer to return 0-length if the operation is not supported",
