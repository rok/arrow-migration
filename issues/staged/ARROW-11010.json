Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI get the following warning when converting a floating point column in a pandas dataframe into a pyarrow array:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n/Users/swast/src/python-bigquery/.nox/prerelease_deps/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pyarrow/pandas_compat.py:1031: DeprecationWarning: `np.float` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `float`. Use `float` by itself, which is identical in behavior, to silence this warning. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.float_` here.\r\n 'floating': np.float,\r\n\r\n```",
