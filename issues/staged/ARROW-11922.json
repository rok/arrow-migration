        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11922](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11922). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe old R `feather` package had a function called\u00a0`feather::feather_metadata()` that allowed to read column names and types from feather files on disk, without opening them. This was useful to select only specific columns when loading a feather file in R with `read_feather(path, columns = c(...)`\r\n\r\nApparently [there is no direct replacement for this function in arrow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66540589/926810). Can one be implemented?",
