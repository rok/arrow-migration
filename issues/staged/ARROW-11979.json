        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11979](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11979). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `sort_limit` kernel was added by @sundy-li in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9602\r\n\r\nWhile writing some doc examples in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9721, it occured to me we could potentially simplify the API so I figured I would offer a proposed PR for comment\r\n\r\n1. Rationale\n   \n   Since we already have a `SortOptions` structure that controls sorting options, we could also add the `limit` to that structure rather than adding a new `sort_limit` function and still avoid changing the API\n   \n1. Changes\n   \n   Move the `limit` option to `SortOptions`\n",
