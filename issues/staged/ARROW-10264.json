Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollow-up on ARROW-10175. In the HDFS integration tests, there is a test using a URI failing if we use the new filesystem / dataset implementation:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nFAILED opt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/tests/test_hdfs.py::TestLibHdfs::test_read_multiple_parquet_files_with_uri\r\n```\r\n\r\nfails with\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Path '/tmp/pyarrow-test-838/multi-parquet-uri-48569714efc74397816722c9c6723191/0.parquet' is not relative to '/user/root'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile it is passing a URI (and not a filesystem object) to `parquet.read_table`, and the new filesystems/dataset implementation should be able to handle URIs.\r\n\r\ncc `[~apitrou]`",
