Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn some cases the test for `arrow::fs::GcsFilesystem` is very slow. There is no obvious reason for this problem, we should find it why and fix it. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11375#issuecomment-942397629\r\n\r\n> Hmm, gcfs_test is not hanging anymore but it's still taking a lot of time:\n> ```Java\n> [ RUN      ] GcsFileSystem.FileSystemCompare\n> [       OK ] GcsFileSystem.FileSystemCompare (20025 ms)\n> ```\r\n\r\nUgh, that looks painful. On my workstation that particular test completes in milliseconds:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n[ RUN      ] GcsFileSystem.FileSystemCompare\r\n[       OK ] GcsFileSystem.FileSystemCompare (5 ms)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the full test with with archery docker run ubuntu-cpp takes about 3 seconds:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n54/85 Test #49: arrow-gcsfs-test ..........................   Passed    3.05 sec\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
