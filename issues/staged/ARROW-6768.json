Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Scan interface exposes classes (ScanTask/Iterator) which are not of interest to all callers. This would implement\u00a0`Status Scan::Materialize(std::shared_ptr<arrow::Table>\\* out)` so consumers can\u00a0call this function instead of consuming and dispatching the streaming interface.",
