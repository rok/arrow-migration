This happens irrespective of OS (Windows, Ubuntu Focal, OpenSuse EPS 15 SP2) on company and private machines (several...).\r\nI suspect an issue with the function or the underlying shell script that downloads these third party dependencies.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSimilar to [this Stackexchange thread]([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70044518/how-to-install-c-dependencies-for-the-arrow-package).](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70044518/how-to-install-c-dependencies-for-the-arrow-package))\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\narrow::create_package_with_all_dependencies()\r\nDownloading Arrow source file\r\ntrying URL 'https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib/arrow_7.0.0.tar.gz'\r\nContent type 'application/x-gzip' length 4553836 bytes (4.3 MB)\r\ndownloaded 4.3 MB\r\nDownloading files to C:\\Users\\<user_here>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\4\\Rtmp0srhMl\\file1475c6909878/arrow/tools/thirdparty_dependencies\r\nError in arrow::create_package_with_all_dependencies() :\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 Failed to download thirdparty dependencies\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPS: Ghee I wish Jira would have simple MD support.",
