Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe pyarrow documentation gives to options for nightly builds, one for use with anaconda, one for use with pip. While the anaconda command works, the command for pip sends users to\r\n\r\n<https://repo.fury.io/arrow-nightlies/,> a url which 404s. Sphinx docs need updated for correct url of gemfury.com/arrow-nightlies/",
