Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncpp/cmake_modules/FindgRPCAlt.cmake somehow exposes the same libraries defined in build_absl_once (defined in cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake) causing CMake to fail when GCS client is enabled for building.\r\n\r\nI tried playing around with various options but given my limited CMake skills I could not figure out an easy solution to this.",
