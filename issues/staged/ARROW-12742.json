I have tried many things includiong instyalling from RSPM using\r\n```java\n\r\noptions(repos = c(RPSM = \"https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/__linux__/xenial/latest\"))\n```\r\nand I have also tried installing with\u00a0\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nSys.setenv(LIBARROW_MINIMAL = FALSE); install.packages(\"arrow\", type = \"source\")\r\n```\r\nNothing seems to work and I get this error when trying to load after these installs\r\n```java\n\r\n> library(arrow)\r\nError: package or namespace load failed for \u2018arrow\u2019 in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):\r\n unable to load shared object '/home/rstudio-user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/arrow/libs/arrow.so':\r\n  libcrypto.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\nI need lz4 support to open feather files in Rstudio Cloud",

Like I mentioned at <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67478101/> I believe there is a libssl mismatch between RSPM and RStudio Cloud that is leading to this \u2014 we're in touch with the folks at RStudio to get that resolved. That's leading to the error \\`libcrypto.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` that you're seeing.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, we'll need to find a way to get a functioning arrow install for you. There are two things that might work for you:\r\n \\* Install using an Arrow-built binary of the arrow library. To do this, run the following: `Sys.setenv(LIBARROW_BINARY = TRUE); install.packages('arrow', type = \"source\")`\r\n\r\n \\* Install the R package and build arrow from source. To do this, run the following: `Sys.setenv(LIBARROW_MINIMAL = FALSE); install.packages('arrow', type = \"source\")` Though based [on your comment on that SO issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67478101/how-do-i-install-the-arrow-package-on-rstudio-cloud-with-lz4-support#comment119292612_67478101) it looks like building from source didn't work for you \u2014 if you want to diagnose what's going on there, the suggestion in the error (Re-run with ARROW_R_DEV=true) is the way to see more output as it's running. But I suspect that you might be running into a resource exhaustion while building the arrow library (not totally surprising since the basic RStudio Cloud session only has 1gb of ram), but the verbose output would tell us the answer to that.\r\n\r\nFor either of these, if you run into trouble, please also set `Sys.setenv(ARROW_R_DEV = TRUE)` before installing and post the full output here so we can help diagnose what's going on."
