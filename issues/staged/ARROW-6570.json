        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6570](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6570). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt occurred to me that we can likely improve the performance and scalability of `Table.to_pandas` or other `to_pandas` methods by using the active MemoryPool to allocate memory for the array rather than letting NumPy use the system allocator. We would need to use the `PyCapsule` approach to setting a `shared_ptr<Buffer>` as the base of the created NumPy arrays\r\n\r\nThis has the additional benefit of tracking NumPy-related allocations in the MemoryPool so we will have a more precise accounting of allocated memory.
