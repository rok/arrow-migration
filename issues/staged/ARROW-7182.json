Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://circleci.com/gh/ursa-labs/crossbow/4959 for example. \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n/arrow/ci/scripts/fuzzit_build.sh: line 26: pushd: /arrow/cpp/build/relwithdebinfo: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nScrolling up in the logs, it looks like the build dir is actually `/build/cpp`, so given that, we should `pushd /build/cpp/relwithdebinfo`.\r\n\r\ncc `[~kszucs]`",
