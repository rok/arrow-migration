        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16292](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16292). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDocument\u00a0 changes needed to support JSE17:\r\n1. Changed for arrow side: Changes related to\u00a0`--add-exports\"`\u00a0are needed to continue supporting erroProne base on JSE11+\u00a0[installation doc](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation). It mean you won't need this changes if you run arrow java building code without errorProne validation (mvn clean install -P-error-prone-jdk11+ ....)\n   \n1. Changes as a user of arrow: If the user are planning to use Arrow with JSE17 is needed to pass modules needed. For example if I run cookbook for IO\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/java/io.html>\u00a0it finished with an error mention\u00a0`Unable to make field long java.nio.Buffer.address accessible: module java.base does not \"opens java.nio\" to unnamed module`\u00a0for that reason as a user for JSE17 (not for arrow changes) is needed to add VM arguments as\u00a0`-ea --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED`\u00a0and it will finished without errors.\n   \n   \u00a0\n   \n   This ticket are related with https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12941#pullrequestreview-950090643",
