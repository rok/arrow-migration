Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn one run on ARROW-16510:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  brew install -v --HEAD apache-arrow\r\n# for testing\r\n  brew install minio\r\n  shell: /usr/local/bin/bash -e {0}\r\n  env:\r\n    ARROW_GLIB_FORMULA: ./arrow/dev/tasks/homebrew-formulae/apache-arrow-glib.rb\r\nWarning: apache-arrow HEAD-65a6929 is already installed and up-to-date.\r\nTo reinstall HEAD, run:\r\n  brew reinstall apache-arrow\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, 65a6929 is the SHA of apache/arrow@master, not the SHA of the commit being tested: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/7055249700?check_suite_focus=true#step:3:17\r\n\r\nI tried to force an uninstall and then a reinstall, but that errored differently: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/7056474511?check_suite_focus=true#step:4:29\r\n\r\nNote that the revision pinning logic does work correctly in the autobrew version of this.",
