Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now the BackgroundGenerator (async_generator.h) can deadlock if the user does not transfer onto a new thread task.\u00a0 It's also typically a good idea to keep the background generator iterating the input as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf the background generator could create a promise that required callbacks to run on a new thread it would prevent callers from having to remember to do so.",
