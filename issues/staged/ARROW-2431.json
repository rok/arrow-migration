Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nref <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1829#discussion_r179248743>\r\n\r\nCurrently\u00a0our Traits are\u00a0not loyal to <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/metadata.html>.\r\n\r\nFor example, we nest `Field`s in the `DataType` (aka `type`) attribute of the parent Field (rather than having the type be `Struct` and a separate `Children` parameter)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs this OK, assuming that we can read and write accurate schemas? Or should we move towards having the Schema\u00a0trait\u00a0be consistent with the metadata spec?",
