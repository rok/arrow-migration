        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7912](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7912). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nApache Arrow is designed to be a universal in-memory format for the representation\r\nof tabular (\"columnar\") data. However, some projects may face a difficult\r\nchoice between either depending on a fast-evolving project such as the\r\nArrow C++ library, or having to reimplement adapters for data interchange,\r\nwhich may require significant, redundant development effort.\r\n\r\nThe Arrow C data interface defines a very small, stable set of C definitions\r\nthat can be easily **copied** in any project's source code and used for columnar\r\ndata interchange in the Arrow format.  For non-C/C++ languages and runtimes,\r\nit should be almost as easy to translate the C definitions into the\r\ncorresponding C FFI declarations.\r\n\r\nApplications and libraries can therefore work with Arrow memory without\r\nnecessarily using Arrow libraries or reinventing the wheel. Developers can\r\nchoose between tight integration\r\nwith the Arrow **software project** (benefitting from the growing array of\r\nfacilities exposed by e.g. the C++ or Java implementations of Apache Arrow,\r\nbut with the cost of a dependency) or minimal integration with the Arrow\r\n**format** only.\r\n\r\n",
