        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17346](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17346). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeveral ScanOptions methods take a batchSize argument as shown:\u00a0\r\n\r\n`public ScanOptions(long batchSize) {`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 this(batchSize, Optional.empty());`\r\n``}\r\n\r\nSince the scanner reads one ArrowRecordBatch per load invocation, setting the parameter to a size larger than the RecordBatch has no effect. It only works when it's smaller than the number of rows in the RecordBatch, (i.e., the number or records read is equal to min(batchSize, recordBatch rowCount), potentially leading to some confusion.\u00a0",
