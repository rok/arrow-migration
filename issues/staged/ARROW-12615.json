Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the compute kernels `stddev `and `variance` automatically ignore NAs, but it would be useful if there was an option to toggle this behaviour",

So it makes sense to add this to stddev/variance as well."
