        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4462](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4462). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBy upgrading to LZ4 v1.8.3 the patch and patching step can be removed as it is incorporated into a newer version of VS2010 solution and also VS2017 solution is provided which ease the usage with newer versions. Is there a reason or fixed dependency on v1.7.5?\r\n\r\nThere is still an issue with newer than v8.1 MS Build Tools, and requires manual retargeting. Which can be fixed in CMake\u00a0by introducing complex logic of reading registry tree HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\MSBuild\\ToolsVersions\\4.0\\1\\*.0 and analyzing which version of tools are installed and then patching the solution and projects. But as this is an external dependency better to submit patch there.",
