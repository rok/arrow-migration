        "title": "[Java] Inconsistent logic for type IDs in Union vectors",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14271](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14271). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current logic for calculating the type IDs in UnionVector#getField and\u00a0DenseUnionVector#getField is:\r\n1. DenseUnionVector uses an increasing counter\u00a0\n1. UnionVector uses the ordinal of the type enum\n1. Both completely ignore the type IDs provided at construction as part of\u00a0fieldType (if provided)\n   \n   We encountered this inconsistency while testing a direct roundtrip of a union vector between\u00a0pyarrow and Java with the C Data Interface ('direct' here means without using VectorSchemaRoot/RecordBatch). The identifiers for the type IDs differ after completing a roundtrip.\u00a0\n   \n   \u00a0",
