        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8516](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8516). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<font color=\"#000000\">BufferBuilder</font><font color=\"#0073bf\"><</font><font color=\"#000000\">BooleanType>::append_slice is called by PrimitiveBuilder</font><font color=\"#000000\">::append_slice with a constructed vector of true values. </font>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#000000\">Even in release builds the associated allocations and iterations are not optimised out, resulting in a third of the time to parse a parquet file containing single integers being spent in PrimitiveBuilder::append_slice.</font>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#000000\">This PR adds an append_n method to the BufferBuilderTrait that allows this to be handled more efficiently. My rather unscientific testing shows it to halve the amount of time spent in this method yielding an ~20% speedup for my particular workload.</font>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
