Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLink times are a significant drag in MSVC builds. They don't affect Linux nearly as much when building with Ninja. I suggest we combine some of the fast-running tests within logical units to see if we can cut down from 106 test executables to 70 or so\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 107\r\nLabel Time Summary:\r\narrow-tests           =  21.19 sec*proc (48 tests)\r\narrow_python-tests    =   0.26 sec*proc (1 test)\r\nexample               =   0.05 sec*proc (1 test)\r\ngandiva-tests         =  11.65 sec*proc (39 tests)\r\nparquet-tests         =  35.81 sec*proc (18 tests)\r\nunittest              =  68.92 sec*proc (106 tests)\r\n```",
