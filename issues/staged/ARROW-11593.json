Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow crate successfully compiles to WebAssembly (e.g. https://github.com/domoritz/arrow-wasm) but the Parquet crate currently does not support the`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. \r\n\r\nTry out the repository at https://github.com/domoritz/parquet-wasm/commit/e877f9ad9c45c09f73d98fab2a8ad384a802b2e0. The problem seems to be in liblz4, even if I do not include lz4 in the feature flags.  ",

Maybe it could even be useful as a Ballista worker."
