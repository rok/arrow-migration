Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCalling Unique on\u00a0 e. g. \\{\"some long string data\",\"some long string data\",\"other data\"} returns\r\n\r\ndictionary with\u00a0\"some long string data\" appearing twice. This is caused by off by 1 error in DoubleCrcHash, which caused it to read\u00a01 byte past the end of the strings with length\u00a0 higher than 16, and not divisible by 4. In such cases, we never hash p[0], and we always read one extra byte.",
