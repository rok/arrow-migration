        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9586](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9586). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe've been running into issues with Flight and gRPC leaking direct memory at scale. One thing we'd like to do is have a (child) allocator per DoGet/DoPut call, so we can more accurately track memory usage. We have a candidate implementation that is rather messy, but can be upstreamed as part of flight-grpc.\r\n\r\nThis also requires changes to _ensure_ all Arrow resources are cleaned up before we notify gRPC that the call has finished.",
