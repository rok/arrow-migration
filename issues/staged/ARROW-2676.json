So there should be one entry for each job that was created \u2013 the git hash for the task, the CI service used to run the task, etc. It should also indicate if one or more artifacts are expected to be uploaded\n  \n- Tasks should be configured with the tag name, and artifacts should be uploaded to GitHub under the tag which should appear as a release on the repo\n  \n- We write a status tool which can query the status of a particular run and determine if the run is complete\n  \n- We write a tool to download all artifacts associated with a particular run and sign them with the release manager's GPG key\n  \n  So here's what I'm expecting:\n  \n  ```Java\n  \n  $ python crossbow.py ...\n  ...\n  Job run tag: build-1234\n  \n  $ python check-build-status.py build-1234\n  Task 1 on Travis CI completed\n  ...\n  Task N on AppVeyor still running\n  \n  $ python check-build-status.py build-1234\n  ...\n  All tasks completed\n  \n  $ python download-build-artifacts.py build-1234 --sign\n  ``` \n  \n  Here are the boxes we need to check:\n  \n- Can we run each desired task in a particular CI service? (the MVP for this is ARROW-2430)\n- We can determine the list of created tasks associated with a particular run\n- Each task can upload its artifacts to a deterministic central location (e.g. GitHub), where the artifacts are not commingled with any other run (that's this issue ARROW-2676)\n- We can determine whether all the expected artifacts from a particular run have been successfully uploaded (i.e. to GitHub)\n- We can, in an automated way and without clicking on a webpage, download all the artifacts from a successful run and GPG sign them for purposes of a release vote"

            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2676?focusedCommentId=16511240) by Phillip Cloud (cpcloud):*\nUpdate on this: `[~kszucs]` is making progress.\r\n\r\nLet's address each bullet individually:\r\n\r\n- **_Can we run each desired task in a particular CI service?_**: This is currently possible as of ARROW-2430, as noted.\n- **_We can determine the list of created tasks associated with a particular run_**: Crossbow is now creating a new branch per job like `build-<number>`. The individual tasks are prefixed with the job name, and that is followed by the task name. A concrete example is: [`build-30-conda-linux`](https://github.com/kszucs/crossbow/tree/build-33-conda-linux). This contains the YAML file that is run on some service, in this case Travis CI.\n- **_Each task can upload its artifacts to a deterministic central location (e.g. GitHub), where the artifacts are not commingled with any other run_**: Because of the way branches are named, this is by definition how the tool works. [Here are the artifacts for build-30-conda-linux](https://github.com/kszucs/crossbow/releases/tag/build-30).\n- **_We can determine whether all the expected artifacts from a particular run have been successfully uploaded (i.e. to GitHub)_**: This is [in progress](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2109/files#diff-9bbf77c0a253f3c1c9a490af27c9101dR353).\n- **_We can, in an automated way and without clicking on a webpage, download all the artifacts from a successful run and GPG sign them for purposes of a release vote_**: Not yet started, but next up in the queue."

I understand this is a complex endeavor (made more so by the build-up of technical debt in arrow-dist) so wanted to make sure we're breaking down the hard problem into tractable pieces (in the Lao Tzu spirit of \"accomplish the great task by a series of small acts\")"
