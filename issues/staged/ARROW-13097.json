Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn cases such as ARROW-13025 it's advantageous to avoid boilerplate when dealing with objects which are basic structs of data members. A simple reflection utility (get/set the value of a data member, print the name of a member to string) would allow writing functionality generically in terms of a tuple of properties, greatly reducing boilerplate.\r\n\r\nSee a sketch of one such utility here https://gist.github.com/bkietz/7899f477e86df49f21ab17201c518d74",
