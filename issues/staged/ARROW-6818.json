        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6818](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6818). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI find there are several issues in the format docs.\r\n\r\n1) there is a claimed distinction between \"logical types\" and \"physical types\", but the \"physical types\" actually lists logical types such as Map\r\n2) the \"logical types\" document doesn't actually list logical types, it just sends to the flatbuffers file. One shouldn't have to read a flatbuffers file to understand the Arrow format.\r\n3) some terminology seems unusual, such as \"relative type\"\r\n4) why is there a link to the Apache Drill docs?",

Map isn't mentioned anywhere in the Format doc anymore.\r\n\r\n2. The document says: \"We do not go into detail about the logical types definitions in this document as we consider `Schema.fbs`_ to be authoritative.\" I don't think this is confusing, and it avoids things getting out of sync.\u00a0\r\n\r\n3. \"Relative type\" doesn't appear anywhere in the doc anymore.\u00a0\r\n\r\n4. There is still a reference to the Apache Drill design docs and I agree it is not clear why. I will open a PR to remove this link."
