Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith previous work (ARROW-7329 and ARROW-7505), Netty based allocation is only one of the possible implementations. So we need to revise BufferAllocator and ReferenceManager, to make them general, and independent of Netty libraries.",
