Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen ``-DARROW_BUILD_STATIC=ON``, all build dependencies built as static libraries by the Arrow build system will be merged together to create a static library ``arrow_bundled_dependencies``.\r\n \u00a0\r\n But that is only true when there are indeed some\u00a0dependencies, i.e., when ``ARROW_BUNDLED_STATIC_LIBS`` is not empty [1]. It could be empty when we just enable some of features when building arrow (e.g., just the arrow core).\r\n \u00a0\r\n However the target is unconditionally required by the target ``arrow_static`` [2]. That makes the staticly-built arrow libs cannot be used with cmake.\r\n \u00a0\r\n [1]: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/CMakeLists.txt#L523>\r\n [2]:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/ArrowConfig.cmake.in#L74>",
