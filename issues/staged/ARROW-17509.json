        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17509](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17509). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now the AsyncScheduler requires that we call End.  This is to distinguish between a scheduler running out of tasks because it hit an idle period (in which case it shouldn't mark itself finished) and a scheduler running out of tasks because it is truly done (in which case it should mark itself finished).\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to require that scheduler tasks only be added by existing tasks.  When creating a scheduler one would supply an \"initial task\" to bootstrap the first set of tasks.  In this case we could get rid of the End method because the only time a scheduler will run out of tasks is when it is finished.",
