Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be great to support MapType and (nested) StructType in Arrow so that PySpark can make use of it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n Quite often as in my use-case in Hive table cells are also complex types saved. Currently it's not possible to user the new `[pandas_udf|https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html?highlight=explode#pyspark.sql.functions.pandas_udf]` decorator which internally uses Arrow to generate a UDF for\u00a0columns with complex types.",
