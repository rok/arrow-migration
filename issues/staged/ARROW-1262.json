Unfortunately, I don't think we can upload to these BinTray repositories from Travis CI, because I do not have an API key for the apache BinTray account. Because the API key would give unrestricted access to all Apache projects on bintray, I am not sure if ASF Infra would be willing to give it to me. \n\nWhat we could do is put all automatically-built package artifacts from Travis CI in an account owned by one of us, and then upload the packages to BinTray after the release. See here I have my BinTray account where I've built some Python packages:\n\nhttps://bintray.com/wesm/apache-arrow-test/pyarrow#files/wheels\n\nThere is also the question of how and when to GPG sign the packages (if this is needed)"

Apache Aurora doesn't provide APT and Yum repositories. Apache Aurora just provides .deb and .rpm. We may need to find an Apache project that provides APT and Yum repositories to decide our way."
