I'd like to do something similar with Ray, ideally people would be able to pip install the project from any commit. Sort of like https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tf-nightly except with every commit, not just the most recent."

It might be a little work to munge the package metadata to do this. I have already found having the conda nightlies to be incredibly useful"
