Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`pip install pyarrow==0.4.0` does not install the pxd files found in `python/pyarrow/includes`. \n\nThis prevents use of pyarrow Cython code downstream; something as simple as `from pyarrow.lib cimport Array` fails due to\n\n```Java\n/Users/jhscott/.virtualenvs/arrow_cython/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyarrow/lib.pxd: cannot find cimported module 'pyarrow.includes.libarrow'\n/Users/jhscott/.virtualenvs/arrow_cython/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyarrow/lib.pxd: cannot find cimported module 'pyarrow.includes.common'\n```\n\nManually copying these pxd files from the arrow source tree into the location Cython complains about fixes the problem.\n\nSee https://github.com/snakescott/arrow_cython for an example repro.",
