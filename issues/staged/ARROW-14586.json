Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis affects code along the lines of `summarise(mean(mean(var))` where the inner expression is an aggregate function. This is probably not useful but the error it gives is not particularly helpful:\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\nlibrary(arrow, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\nlibrary(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\nRecordBatch$create(x = 4) %>% \r\n  summarise(y = mean(mean(x)))\r\n#> Warning: Error in mean(..temp0) : object '..temp0' not found; pulling data into\r\n#> R\r\n#> # A tibble: 1 \u00d7 1\r\n#>       y\r\n#>   <dbl>\r\n#> 1     4\r\n```",
