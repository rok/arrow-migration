        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10051](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10051). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAggregate kernel _consumes_ each batch and output a _state_, which is then _merged_ with other batches. Currently, _state_ parameter is defined as _const KernelState&_ in merge interface. It may cause unnecessary data copying for kernels with non-trivial states.\r\n E.g., mode kernel maintains a value:count map in its _state_ structure, it's better to move the map than copy it (for merge operation of the first batch).\r\n\r\nAggregate kernel code template is at [1]. _batch_state_ is an auto variable(line 873), modifying it in kernel->merge() is okay (line 888).\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/a17717fa528bb7d495cfba5c6b5fb67866934a63/cpp/src/arrow/compute/exec.cc#L871-L891",
