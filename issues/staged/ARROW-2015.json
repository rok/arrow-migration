Seeing that some other projects recently made the same step, we could also probably do this (but be aware that I'm not Java dev currently, I most care about the C++/Python parts of Arrow, so others will have a stronger opinion) . Feel free to join in tomorrow at 1700 UTC:\u00a0\u00a0https://meet.google.com/vtm-teks-phx"
