Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome users would like to build lightweight versions of PyArrow, for example for use in AWS Lambda or similar systems which constrain the total size of usable libraries.\r\n\r\nHowever, PyArrow currently mandates some Arrow C++ components which can lead to a very sizable Arrow binary install: Compute, CSV, Dataset, Filesystem, HDFS and JSON.",

And I suppose HDFS is also already optional?\r\n\r\nBut it would indeed be good to make more of the others optional as well. Compute would probably give the biggest benefit, although also the most difficult one? In the cython code this is actually already handled using the `_pc` object (so that we can call compute functions in lib.pyx without importing the module directly). But the PyArrow C++ code also depends on Compute for casting (and we depend on that in the numpy/pandas <-> arrow conversion, which is currently a part that is not meant to be optional)"

Since it's deprecated we may just ignore it then.\r\n\r\nAs for the Compute dependency: perhaps we can factor out the casting code in PyArrow C++ (there's not much of it) and use compilation directives to simply return `NotImplemented` if Compute was not enabled."
