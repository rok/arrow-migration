Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt looks like ArrayRangeEquals in compare.cc only checks type IDs before doing comparison actual values.\u00a0 This is inconsistent with ArrayEquals which checks for type equality and also seems incorrect for cases like Decimal128.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI presume this was an oversight when fixing\u00a0ARROW-2567 but maybe it was intentional?\r\n\r\n`[~uwe]`?",
