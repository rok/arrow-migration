        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16965](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16965). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/6300> introduced a change to the `case_when()`\u00a0API.\r\n\r\nMost importantly:\r\n> There is a new `.default` argument that is intended to replace usage of `TRUE ~ default_value`\r\nThere are also new arguments `.ptype` and `{}.size{`}.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other changes also, highlighted in the [dplyr NEWS.md file](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/NEWS.md)\r\n\r\nAlso see <https://twitter.com/dvaughan32/status/1542942862077317121>.\r\n\r\nWe should update the `case_when()` binding in the arrow R package to be consistent with its new behaviors in dplyr, or to throw an error if the user passes new arguments that we cannot handle consistently with dplyr.",
