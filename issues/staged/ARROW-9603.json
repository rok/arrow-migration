Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nparquet/column_writer.cc WriteArrow implementations at certain points checks null counts/required data and passes through the null bitmap for encoding.\u00a0 This only works for nested data types if the if the null slot on a parent implies a null slot on the leaf.\u00a0 This relationship is not required by the specifications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMost paths for creating arrays follow this pattern so it would be esoteric to hit this bug, but we should still fix it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll branches that rely on reading nullness should generate a new null bitmap based on definition levels if the column is nested, and decisions should be based off of that.",
