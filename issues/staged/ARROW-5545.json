Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor timestamp datatypes, if the timezone parameter is non-empty, the int64 array values in the associated column are assumed to be normalized to UTC.\u00a0 This requirement should be made clear to the C++ API user.\u00a0 (It can be inferred from the flatbuffers schema, but that internal implementation document\u00a0probably wouldn't ordinarily be consulted by a C++ API consumer.)",
