Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed that when reading <struct<list<primitive>>>, we overwrite the list's field name with the struct's one.\r\n\r\nIf we have a struct called \"a\", and a list called \"items\", the list gets the name \"a\", which is incorrect. See the test case called \"arrow::arrow_writer::tests::arrow_writer_complex\", which produces this behaviour. The test will be merged as part of ARROW-10766.",
