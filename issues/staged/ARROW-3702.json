        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3702](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3702). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhy was POSIXct mapped to [DataType](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/classarrow_1_1_date_type.html#a6aea1fcfd9f998e8fa50f5ae62dbd7e6)\u00a0not\u00a0[TimestampType](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/classarrow_1_1_timestamp_type.html#a88e0ba47b82571b3fc3798b6c099499b)?\u00a0What are the PRO/CONs from each approach?\r\n\r\nThis is mostly to interoperate with Spark which choose to map\u00a0POSIXct to Timestamps since in Spark, not Arrow, dates do not have a time component. There is a way to make this work in Spark with\u00a0POSIXct mapped to DateType by mapping DateType to timestamps, so mostly looking to understand tradeoffs.\r\n\r\nOne particular question, timestamps in arrow seem to support timezones, wouldn't it make more sense to map POSIXct to timestamps?",

This is a strong argument for mapping POSIXct to Timestamp since the Arrow flatbuffer's file does mention that a date MUST be\u00a0divisible by\u00a086400000, which I believe is currently not the case:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Schema.fbs>\r\n```java\n\r\n/// Date is either a 32-bit or 64-bit type representing elapsed time since UNIX\r\n/// epoch (1970-01-01), stored in either of two units:\r\n///\r\n/// * Milliseconds (64 bits) indicating UNIX time elapsed since the epoch (no\r\n///   leap seconds), where the values are evenly divisible by 86400000\r\n/// * Days (32 bits) since the UNIX epoch\n```"
