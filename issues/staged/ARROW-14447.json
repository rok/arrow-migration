Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the `pyproject.toml` file we need to specify the numpy version to build against, and this needs to be the \"oldest supported version\" which depends on the python version you are running. \r\n\r\nThe https://github.com/scipy/oldest-supported-numpy meta package helps with this.\r\n\r\ncc `[~kszucs]`",
