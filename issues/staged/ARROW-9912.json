Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am working on an engine to handle timeseries data. Unsurprisingly for such a system, values of timestamp type feature prominently and we need basic support for them in DataFusion.\r\n\r\nInitially, we want to use DataFusion with predicates such as '=', '<', '>', etc on timestamp columns and timestamp literals. For example, finding all rows in a dataset that fall within a certain timestamp range.\r\n\r\nHere is a document with a more formal proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18O9YPRyJ3u7-58J02NtNVYb6TDWBzi3mIQC58VhwxUk/edit#",
