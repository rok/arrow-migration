For this statement:\r\n\r\nSELECT NULL\r\n\r\nSpark implements a special NullType for this return type but that creates a lot of side effects for things like the Parquet writer and JDBC drivers do not support this type.\r\n\r\nI tested Postgres:\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE test AS\r\nSELECT NULL;\r\n\r\nThe DDL for this table shows that column as a text type so that is why I have applied the default utf8 type to Value(Null)."
