Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOnce the number of rows needed for a limit query has been produced, any further work done to read values from its input is wasted.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of LimitStream will keep polling its input for the next value, and returning Poll::Ready(None) , even once the limit has been reached\r\n\r\nThis is wasteful\r\n",
