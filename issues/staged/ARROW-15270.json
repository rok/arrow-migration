Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, if I partition a dataset as shown below, a directory `partitioned` is created along with `2001, 2002, 2003, 2004` as subdirectories. But then, if I wanted to only read the partitions corresponding to years `{}2001, 2002{`}, I wouldn't have a straightforward way of doing so.\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> table = pa.table({'month': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'year': [2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2004]})\r\n>>> table\r\npyarrow.Table\r\nmonth: int64\r\nyear: int64\r\n----\r\nmonth: [[1,2,3,4,5]]\r\nyear: [[2001,2002,2003,2004,2004]]\r\n>>> ds.write_dataset(data=table, base_dir=\"partitioned\", format=\"ipc\", partitioning=ds.partitioning(pa.schema([(\"year\", pa.int64())])))\r\n>>> f = fs.SubTreeFileSystem(base_path='partitioned', base_fs=fs.LocalFileSystem())\r\n>>> ds.dataset(source=['2001','2002'], filesystem=f, format=\"ipc\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n\u00a0 File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n\u00a0 File \"/Users/userr2232/Documents/misc/first-julia-nn/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyarrow/dataset.py\", line 683, in dataset\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 return _filesystem_dataset(source, **kwargs)\r\n\u00a0 File \"/Users/userr2232/Documents/misc/first-julia-nn/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyarrow/dataset.py\", line 423, in _filesystem_dataset\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 fs, paths_or_selector = _ensure_multiple_sources(source, filesystem)\r\n\u00a0 File \"/Users/userr2232/Documents/misc/first-julia-nn/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyarrow/dataset.py\", line 344, in _ensure_multiple_sources\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 raise IsADirectoryError(\r\nIsADirectoryError: Path 2001 points to a directory, but only file paths are supported.

The problem is that you are using \"directory partitioning\", so you need to pass in the partitioning schema when loading. (Hive-style partitions, like `year=2021/`, don't require this.)\r\n\r\nTry this:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow.dataset as ds\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\ntable = pa.table({'month': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'year': [2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2004]})\r\n\r\npartitioning = ds.partitioning(pa.schema([(\"year\", pa.int64())]))\r\n\r\nds.write_dataset(\r\n    data=table, \r\n    base_dir=\"partitioned\", \r\n    format=\"ipc\", \r\n    partitioning=partitioning\r\n)\r\n\r\nmy_ds = ds.dataset(\r\n    \"partitioned\", \r\n    format=\"ipc\", \r\n    partitioning=partitioning\r\n)\r\nmy_ds.to_table(filter=(ds.field(\"year\") == 2001) | (ds.field(\"year\") == 2002))\r\n```"

It would likely create a Union dataset by separately performing dataset discovery in each directory you pass. For the use case you are showing, that has two disadvantages: (1) It may be slower than just doing the discovery process once; (2) It won't materialize the year column in the resulting table."
