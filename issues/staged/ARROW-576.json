Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI encountered this working on ARROW-459 \u2013 while we have the ability to write and read record batches, the schema/metadata parts of the file and stream reader/writer implementations are not complete. I did a bit of work on it in my patch for ARROW-459 but gave up as I realized there was more work to do than made sense for that patch (which is for dictionary-encoded data). ",
