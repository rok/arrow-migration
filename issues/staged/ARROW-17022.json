Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe swiss join utilities being added as part of ARROW-14182 are not adequately unit tested at the moment.  They have fairly decent coverage from end-to-end random hash join testing.  However, a set of basic unit tests will help future maintenance by demonstrating basic usage and allowing for more targeted fixes when a refactor breaks something.  I'm doing some of this work as I review ARROW-14182 anyways so that I can better understand it.  Rather than complicate the review I will open this as a separate follow-up PR.",
