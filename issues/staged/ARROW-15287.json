Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor context, it was asked on StackOverflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70629168/](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70629168/how-to-decode-arrow-flight-flightdata-with-a-pure-grpc-client/70629249)\r\n\r\nSince the point of using Protobuf and gRPC was to get compatibility with \"simple\" Flight implementations, we should document what's necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso see ARROW-4419 - maybe fixing that would take care of this too.",
