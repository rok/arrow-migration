        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11248](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11248). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAccording to the comments from function `set_bits`:\r\n \u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n/// sets all bits on `write_data` on the range `[offset_write..offset_write+len]` to be equal to the\r\n/// bits on `data` on the range `[offset_read..offset_read+len]`\n```\r\nThe function has a defect if `write_data` contains non-null bits: it does not unset bits and update the `diff count`. Perhaps should add comment to state that `write_data` in range\u00a0`[offset_write..offset_write+len]` **has been zeroed out.**",
