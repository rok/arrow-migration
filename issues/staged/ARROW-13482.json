Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExecNodes' factory functions are confusingly non-uniform, which means a lot of boilerplate when composing them into even a simple ExecPlan. Providing a standard factory interface for these and a registry in which to store them by name will simplify declaration of ExecPlans.",
