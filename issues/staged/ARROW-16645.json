It's actually broader than just `pa.NA`, as we don't yet accept any kind of pyarrow scalar in the constructors. For example\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> arr = pa.array([1, 2, 3])\r\n>>> scalar= arr[0]\r\n>>> scalar\r\n<pyarrow.Int64Scalar: 1>\r\n>>> pa.array([scalar])\r\n...\r\nArrowInvalid: Could not convert <pyarrow.Int64Scalar: 1> with type pyarrow.lib.Int64Scalar: did not recognize Python value type when inferring an Arrow data type\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd for that general issue, we have ARROW-5295 tracking this. \r\n\r\nThere is maybe something to say to already special case pa.NA (which can go alongside the handling of pd.NA/pd.NaT in `PandasObjectIsNull`), although I think I would rather see a general solution for all scalars."
