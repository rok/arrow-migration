        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12601](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12601). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI installed the arrow R package version 4.0.0 from CRAN on an Intel Mac that does not have pkg-config installed, and I saw this in the installation log\r\n```java\n\r\n./configure: line 81: pkg-config: command not found\r\n./configure: line 82: pkg-config: command not found\r\n./configure: line 83: pkg-config: command not found \n```\r\nThis is happening because of line 79 and 80:\r\n```java\n\r\npkg-config --version >/dev/null 2>&1\r\nif [ \"$ARROW_USE_PKG_CONFIG\" != \"false\" ] && [ $? -eq 0 ]; then \n```\r\nThe first conditional on line 80 causes `$?` to be set to `0`, so then the second conditional evaluates to true. Reverse the order of these two conditionals so that `$?`\u00a0truly reflects whether pkg-config is installed.",
