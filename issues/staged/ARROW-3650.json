        "title": "[Python] Mixed column indexes are read back as strings ",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3650](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3650). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nConsider the following example: \r\n\r\n```java\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(1, index=[pd.to_datetime('2018/01/01')], columns=['a string', pd.to_datetime('2018/01/02')])\r\n\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\npq.write_table(table, 'test.parquet')\r\n\r\nref_df = pq.read_pandas('test.parquet').to_pandas()\r\n\r\nprint(df.columns)\r\n# Index(['a string', 2018-01-02 00:00:00], dtype='object')\r\nprint(ref_df.columns)\r\n# Index(['a string', '2018-01-02 00:00:00'], dtype='object')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe serialized data frame has an index with a string and a datetime field (happened when resetting the index of a formerly datetime only column).\r\nWhen reading the string back the datetime is converted into a string.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the schema I find {{\"pandas_type\": \"mixed\", \"numpy_ty'\r\n            b'pe\": \"object\"}} before serializing and {{\"pandas_type\": \"unicode\", \"numpy_'\r\n            b'type\": \"object\"}} after reading back. So the schema was aware of the mixed type but did not store the actual types.\r\n\r\nThe same happens with other types like numbers as well. One can produce interesting situations:\r\n\r\n`pd.DataFrame(1, index=[pd.to_datetime('2018/01/01')], columns=['1', 1])` can be written but fails to be read back as the index is no more unique with '1' showing up two times.\r\n\r\nIIf this is not a bug but expected maybe the user should be somehow warned that information is lost? Like a `NotImplemented` exception.",
