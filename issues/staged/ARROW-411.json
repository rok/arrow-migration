Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am writing a integration test for a application that uses arrow to transfer data. I didn't to find a easy way to compare two arrow record batches and end up using compare and compareSchemas from https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/tools/Integration.java (After making local changes to make them public)\n\nCan we provide a utility class used for validating arrow data for downstream users?",
