Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently gandiva cache is an LRU cache. It would be interesting to change it so that the expressions which take large amount of time to build stay as long as possible in the cache.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to Implement a new cache for Gandiva focused on this build time policy, and make it configurable so it is possible to define if it will be used the LRU cache or this one based on build time.",
