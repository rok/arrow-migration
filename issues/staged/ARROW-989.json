Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs part of this, we need to be able to get an iterator of record batches from a table. We may want to write this iteration logic in C++ as it will be generally useful. The chunking between columns may be different, so there is some amount of complexity there",
