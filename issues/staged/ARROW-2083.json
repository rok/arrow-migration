Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile appveyor supports a\u00a0 [skip appveyor] you cannot skip only travis. What is the feeling about adding e.g. <https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/5032#issuecomment-273626567>\u00a0to our build. We could also do some simple kind of change detection that we don't build the C++/Python parts and only Java and the integration tests if there was a change in the PR that only affects Java.\r\n\r\nI think it might be worthwhile to spend a bit on that to get a bit of load of the CI infrastructure.",

This is nice because that part of the build matrix won't even be allocated, rather than starting the build and immediately skipping it (which still takes a bit of time). The downside is it has to switch on the branch name rather than a commit message string.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/master/.travis.yml#L80."
