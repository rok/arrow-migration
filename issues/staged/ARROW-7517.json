The builder is an adaptive builder, so the type of the indices will increase as the range of each index type is exceed. Using the `StringDictionary32Builder` allows one to force 32-bit indices if a consistent type is desired. Not sure if it would be worthwhile doing the same for the other types \u2013 at OmniSci we happen to max out at 32-bit indices, so this works for us, for now."
