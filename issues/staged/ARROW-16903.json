        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16903](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16903). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTrying to install the R package on Ubuntu 22.04 gives the following unhelpful error for any configuration, even when using LIBARROW_MINIMAL=true or FORCE_BUNDLED_BUILD=true\r\n```java\n\r\n\u00a0  * installing *source* package \u2018arrow\u2019 ...\r\n  ** using staged installation\r\n  Replacing default rmarkdown theme...\r\n  *** No libarrow binary found for version 8.0.0.9000 on ubuntu-22.04\r\n  *** Proceeding without libarrow\r\n  ------------------------- NOTE ---------------------------\r\n  There was an issue preparing the Arrow C++ libraries.\r\n  See https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nIt would be helpful in the message above to mention `ARROW_R_DEV=true` to debug this further because that is not obvious.\r\n\r\nNow the issue turned out to be this:\r\n```java\n\r\n-- Could NOT find Boost: missing: system filesystem (found /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Boost-1.74.0/BoostConfig.cmake (found suitable version \"1.74.0\", minimum required is \"1.58\"))\r\nCMake Error at cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake:892 (add_library):\r\n  add_library cannot create imported target \"Boost::headers\" because another\r\n  target with the same name already exists.\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake:154 (build_boost)\r\n  cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake:255 (build_dependency)\r\n  cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake:1005 (resolve_dependency)\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:567 (include)\r\n```\r\nSo my system had boost, but it did not have libboost-filesystem-dev. This leads to a fatal error, even when we build with bundled dependencies. Is that expected? It is not documented on https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html that this is a hard requirement.",
