Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI helped develop a small C++/Python library for interacting with databases like Hive and Impala via the HiveServer2 Thrift protocol and making them accessible to Python / pandas:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudera/hs2client\r\n\r\nInternally this interfaces with HS2's own columnar representation. Arrow is a natural partner for this project, much of which could be discarded. I think Arrow would make as much sense as any place to develop this codebase further. It could be later split off into a new project if a large enough community develops\r\n\r\ncc `[~twmarshall]` `[~mjacobs]` for thoughts\r\n\r\nIf we did this, do we need to do a software grant (essentially what I'm proposing is to fork)? Can we just attribute the original Cloudera authors in LICENSE.txt?",

Once that is in state to be developed against, this could then be used in hs2client. I think before that we should try to keep them separate to not overload the Arrow build."

I think this supports the argument to bring hs2client and Arrow closer together. \r\n\r\nI'm not proposing to include this in Arrow's CI since the testing procedure (with Hive or Impala) is more complicated. \r\n\r\nI started a branch to do the integration work, when I have something worth looking at I will put up a PR"
