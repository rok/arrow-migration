Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA few kernel implementation files define enable_if helpers that shadow existing ones, which can cause strange errors in unity builds. For example: scalar_arithmetic.cc defines `enable_if_floating_point` for the C types float/double which conflicts with the one defined in type_traits.h for the Arrow types.",
