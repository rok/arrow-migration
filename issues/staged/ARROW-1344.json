Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is publicly exposed in the Python API. If you give a BufferOutputStream to some writer class, then call `get_result` on the BufferOutputStream, then write to the stream, it will dump core. There is a DCHECK that seems to disallow this, but this was a root cause of ARROW-1338",
