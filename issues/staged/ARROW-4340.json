Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was trying to cleanup the c++ imports based on the current docker-iwyu suggestions, but it requires to be customized (symbol maps and pragmas) more than it is currently. It'd also help a lot to use the latest IWYU version (see the changelog https://include-what-you-use.org/)",

Having support for the latest IWYU would imply compiling from source locally, unless someone can point to a binary release, I do not have time to add this for now as I fear I'll enter rabit whole."
