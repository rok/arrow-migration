        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12739](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12739). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd a variadic function that would take 2+ Arrays and combine/transpose them rowwise into a ListArray. For example:\r\n Input:\r\n```java\n\r\nArray<string>        Array<string>\r\n[                    [\r\n  \"foo\",               \"bar\",\r\n  \"push\"               \"pop\"\r\n]                    ]\r\n \n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```java\n\r\nListArray<list<item: string>>\r\n[\r\n  [\"foo\",\"bar\"],\r\n  [\"push\",\"pop\"]\r\n]\r\n```\r\nThis is similar to the StructArray constructor which takes a list of Arrays and names (but in this case it would only need to take a list of Arrays).",
