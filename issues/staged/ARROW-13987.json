Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile it seems technically possible to construct nested FieldRefs, it doesn't seem that you can use them in practice. And it would also be nice to be able to get a nested FieldRef on an Expression. One solution could be to not handle this within FieldRefs at all and just handle it in Expressions: have a function like `Expression GetField(Expression, name)`.",
