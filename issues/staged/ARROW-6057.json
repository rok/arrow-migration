        "title": "[Python] Parquet files v2.0 created by spark can't be read by pyarrow",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6057](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6057). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyArrow uses footer metadata to determine the format version of parquet file, while parquet-mr lib (which is used by spark) determines version on the page level by page header type. Moreover in ParquetFileWriter parquet-mr hardcodes version in footer to '1'. See:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/master/parquet-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/hadoop/ParquetFileWriter.java#L913>\r\n\r\nThus, spark can write and read its own written files, pyarrow can write and read its own written files, but when pyarrow tries to read file of version 2.0, which was written by spark it throws an error about malformed file (because it thinks that format version is 1.0).\r\n\r\nDepending on the compression method an error is:\r\n\r\n-\u00a0_Corrupt snappy compressed data_\r\n\r\n-\u00a0_GZipCodec failed: incorrect header check_\r\n\r\n-\u00a0_ArrowIOError: Unknown encoding type_",
