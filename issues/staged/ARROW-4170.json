        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4170](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4170). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow since Rust parquet implementation is moved into a separate crate, it's better to create a separate CI job that should be triggered whenever there's code change for it. On the other hand, changes go to arrow crate should only trigger the CI job against arrow.",
