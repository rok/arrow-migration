Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems the C++ `arrow-python-test` often hangs (times out) on MinGW64. Example here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8652/checks?check_run_id=1391934231\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem useful to enable Python on the MinGW test. MinGW is generally not recommended (or even supported) for compiling Python extensions.",
