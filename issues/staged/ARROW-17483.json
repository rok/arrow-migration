        "title": "[Python] Support for 'pa.compute.Expression' in filter argument to 'pa.read_table'",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17483). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the _filters_\u00a0argument supports `{}List{`}[`{}Tuple{`}] or\u00a0`{}List{`}[`{}List{`}[`{}Tuple{`}]] or None as its input types. I was suprised to see that Expressions were not supported, considering that filters are converted to expressions internally when using use_legacy_dataset=False.\r\n\r\nThe check on [L150-L153](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/28cf3f9f769dda11ddfe52bd316c96aecb656522/python/pyarrow/parquet/core.py#L150-L153) short-circuits and succeeds when encountering an expression, but later fails on [L2343](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/28cf3f9f769dda11ddfe52bd316c96aecb656522/python/pyarrow/parquet/core.py#L2343) as the expression is evaluated as part of a boolean expression.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI think declaring filters using pa.compute.Expressions more pythonic and less error-prone,\u00a0 and ill-formed filters will be detected much earlier than when using list-of-tuple-of-string equivalents.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.compute as pc\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\n# Creating a dummy table\r\ntable = pa.table({\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 'year': [2020, 2022, 2021, 2022, 2019, 2021],\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 'n_legs': [2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 100],\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 'animal': [\"Flamingo\", \"Parrot\", \"Dog\", \"Horse\", \"Brittle stars\", \"Centipede\"]\r\n})\r\npq.write_to_dataset(table, root_path='dataset_name_2', partition_cols=['year'])\r\n\r\n# Reading using 'pyarrow.compute.Expression'\r\npq.read_table('dataset_name_2', columns=[\"n_legs\", \"animal\"], filters=pc.field(\"n_legs\") < 4)\r\n\r\n# Reading using List[Tuple]\r\npq.read_table('dataset_name_2', columns=[\"n_legs\", \"animal\"], filters=[('n_legs', '<', 4)])  \n```",
