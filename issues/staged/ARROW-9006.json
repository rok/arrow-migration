Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should not maintain distinct (and possibly differently behaving) implementations of elementwise array casting and scalar casting. The new kernels framework provides for relatively easily generating kernels that can process arrays or scalars. ",

Perhaps these methods could just be deprecated? AFAICT they are only consumed in `arrow::dataset::` and `pa.CScalar` which already depend on the compute module."
