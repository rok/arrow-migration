Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen you pass a Scalar and a ChunkedArray with 2+ chunks to the `or_kleene` or `and_kleene` kernel, it returns all `null` in the result.\r\n\r\nDemonstrating this with the R bindings:\r\n```java\n\r\n> call_function(\"or_kleene\", Scalar$create(TRUE), ChunkedArray$create(c(T,F,T), c(F,T,F)))\r\nChunkedArray\r\n[\r\n  [\r\n    null,\r\n    null,\r\n    null,\r\n    null,\r\n    null,\r\n    null\r\n  ]\r\n]\n```\r\nCompare to the following which all work as one would expect:\r\n\r\nScalar and ChunkedArray with only one chunk (works as expected):\r\n```java\n\r\n> call_function(\"or_kleene\", Scalar$create(TRUE), ChunkedArray$create(c(T,F,T)))\r\nChunkedArray\r\n[\r\n  [\r\n    true,\r\n    true,\r\n    true\r\n  ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\nScalar and Array (works as expected):\r\n```java\n\r\n> call_function(\"or_kleene\", Scalar$create(TRUE), Array$create(c(T,F,T)))\r\nArray\r\n<bool>\r\n[\r\n  true,\r\n  true,\r\n  true\r\n]\r\n```\r\nTwo ChunkedArrays (works as expected):\r\n```java\n\r\n> call_function(\"or_kleene\", ChunkedArray$create(c(T,NA,T), c(F,F,T)), ChunkedArray$create(c(T,NA,T), c(F,F,T)))\r\nChunkedArray\r\n[\r\n  [\r\n    true,\r\n    null,\r\n    true,\r\n    false,\r\n    false,\r\n    true\r\n  ]\r\n]\r\n```",
