Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn our C++ documentation, it may be useful to create a section about how we recommend introducing Arrow as a build / runtime dependency of downstream projects, particularly other CMake-based build systems. This would be at this level:\r\n\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/index.html\r\n\r\nWe have the \"Minimal Build\" example in the codebase which helps, but it may not cover all the various ways that people need to be able to depend on the project.

Plus, there is currently no mention of the requirement of the C++11 standard to be set, as well as the process for linking things like Arrow Datasets, which requires an additional step or two at the moment."
