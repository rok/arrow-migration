Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe filesystem tests in `test_fs.py` that are parametrized with all the tested filesystems have some \"state\" shared between them, at least in the case of S3. \r\n\r\nWhen first a test is run with our own S3FileSystem, which eg creates a directory, this directory is still present when we test the s3fs wrapped filesystem, which causes some tests to pass that would otherwise fail if run in isolation.",
