Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the CSV reader always start from 0 and go until the end, which makes it impossible for DataFusion to split a single file in parts, e.g. via multiple readers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to generalize the reader to support starting from an arbitrary location (via iterating), and also have an optional upper limit.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
