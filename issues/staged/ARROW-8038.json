But when it is coming to encryption it compiles successfully but gives a runtime error of \"Build without SSL\".\r\n\r\nI wanted to know is it related to this issue that binding of OpenSSl/encryption support with c++ package for parquet haven't been done yet that's why the error is coming ?\r\n\r\nAnd if so , is there any other way i can try and test encryption on parquet files in c++ !\u00a0"
