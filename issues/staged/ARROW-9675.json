If I uncomment line six then the table written to disk is loaded as an empty table.\r\n\r\nSimilar behavior is observed when the directory name starts with `_`.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis was not the case in earlier versions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n import pyarrow as pa\r\n import pathlib\r\n _path = pathlib.Path(\"abc\").resolve()\r\n _path /= \"xyz\"\r\n _path /= \".lmn\" # uncomment this has a 'dot' at start of the folder\r\n _path /= \"file_name\"\r\n pq.write_to_dataset(\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 table=pa.table({\"a\": [1], \"b\": [2]}), \r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 root_path=_path.as_posix()\r\n )\r\n t = pq.read_table(_path)\r\n print(t.to_pandas())\r\n\r\n```",
