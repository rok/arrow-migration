        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1599](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1599). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIs PyArrow currently unable to read in Parquet files with a vector as a column? For example, the schema of such a file is below:\n\n{{<pyarrow._parquet.ParquetSchema object at 0x7f2d42493c88>\nmbc: FLOAT\ndeltae: FLOAT\nlabels: FLOAT\nfeatures.type: INT32 INT_8\nfeatures.size: INT32\nfeatures.indices.list.element: INT32\nfeatures.values.list.element: DOUBLE}}\n\nUsing either pq.read_table() or pq.ParquetDataset('/path/to/parquet').read() yields the following error: ArrowNotImplementedError: Currently only nesting with Lists is supported.\n\nFrom the error I assume that this may be implemented in further releases?\n",

It's quite a bit of work to handle decoding of lists within structs, and vice versa; we support reads of structs and lists / lists-of-lists but the full nested data read case has not yet been implemented. I just did some support work for this in PARQUET-1100 https://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp/commit/4b09ac703bc75fee72f94bed8ecfe571096b04c1 and I hope that we can get this completed by end of the year. Development help always appreciated"
