Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA metafunction is a function that provides the `Execute` API but does not contain any kernels. Such functions can also handle non-Array/Scalar inputs like RecordBatch or Table. \r\n\r\nThis will enable bindings to invoke such functions (like take, filter) like\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\ncall_function('take', [table, indices])\r\n```",
