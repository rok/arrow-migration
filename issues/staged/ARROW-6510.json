Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFileStats.mtime returns a microsecond resolution datetime object. At some point we should also expose a mtime_ns attribute that gives the exact nanoseconds as an integer, like os.stat does: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.as_posix",
