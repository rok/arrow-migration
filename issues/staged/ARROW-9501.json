Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`timestampdiff`(**month**, _startDate_, _endDate_) returns wrong result in Gandiva when the _endDate_ < _startDate_ and _endDate_ is the last day of the month. An additional month is said to have passed when the end day is greater than or equal to the start day, but this does not hold true for dates which are last days of the month.\r\n\r\nCase in point, if _startDate_ = **2020-01-31**, _endDate_ = **2020-02-29**, previously `timestampdiff`() returned **0**, but the correct result should be **1**.",
