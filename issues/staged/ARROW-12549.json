Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now, Table  are chunked vectors and Record Batches are struct vectors which means the classes are linked deeply. We should not extend and instead copy the binary search to Table and copy BaseVector.prototype.get etc to record batch. ",
