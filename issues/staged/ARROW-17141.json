Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently selecting a nested field in a StructArray requires multiple selects or flattening of schema. It would be more user friendly to provide a field path e.g.: field_in_top_struct.field_in_substruct.",
