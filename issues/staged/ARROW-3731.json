I think if the ParquetReader is implemented, it could create a arrow::Table type just like RecordBatchFileReader, and then we would be able to reuse the table to tibble conversion function that already exists"

Being able to read parquet has decreased the latency in my project by 60%. I would love to be able to contribute back.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI can contribute the Rcpp code to load parquet into a tibble, but I have little experience with producing a configure file and pkg-config. One thing I need help with is producing the configure file in [https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/configure](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/configure.)\u00a0It\u00a0references pkg-config to figure out how to link to the c++ arrow library. I believe it references information in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/arrow.pc.in.>\u00a0However, in order for the R library to read parquet we need to link to both -lparquet and -larrow. To get this to work on my application I hardcoded the configure file, but I would like to learn how to do this properly. I sense that arrow and parquet are organized as separate projects in the arrow repository, how should I produce a configure that will link to both?"
