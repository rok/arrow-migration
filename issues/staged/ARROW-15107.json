        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15107](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15107). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ngRPC will not signal `is_cancelled` to ongoing RPCs after Shutdown(), even if a deadline is provided. The net effect is that C++/Python servers appear unresponsive to SIGINT. We can implement this manually by setting a flag in Shutdown() that gets read in the ServerCallContext so that RPC handlers know they should cancel. (We may also want to have ServerCallContext call TryCancel in this case so that the client is properly notified.)",
