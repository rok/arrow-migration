Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\r\n1. Rationale\n   \n   1. As @jorgecarleitao noted on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9889#discussion_r607720790, we should be running the check if arrow compiles with stable rust as that is what we target for the arrow crate\n   2. I noticed that there were several redundant settings of `RUSTFLAGS`\n   3. The titles of many of the tests are confusing (to me) as they have a lot of detailed architecture / rust version information rather than the test title\n",
