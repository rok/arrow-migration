Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nStable sort is desirable in many scenarios. It means equal elements preserve their relative order after sorting.\r\n\r\nThere are stable sort algorithms. However, in practice, the best sort algorithm is quick sort and quick sort is not stable.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo make the best of both worlds, we support stable sort by stable comparators. It differs from an ordinary comparator in that it breaks ties by comparing the value indices.\r\n\r\nWith the stable comparator, the quick sort algorithm becomes a stable algorithm.",
