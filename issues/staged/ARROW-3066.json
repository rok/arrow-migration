Join the mailing list or check out the developer wiki.\r\n\r\nBut I could not find \"How to contribute\" on [the Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW).\r\n\r\nThough I can find it in the repository:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow#how-to-contribute\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-contribute-patches\n  \n  We can add the contents to find \"How to contribute\" more easily.\n  Or, we can unify duplicated contents to [the Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW).",
