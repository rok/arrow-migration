        "title": "[Python] Missing links in the docs regarding field and schema DataTypes",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8078](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8078). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current page of Data Types of the pyarrow documentation has a list of the different objects and types that you can use to build custom pyarrow schema. For a lot of them is possible to click in the white box around the module/object name and access a detailed description of the module/object. This is true for almost all the items but for field and schema it's not possible to access the detailed description althoug the corresponding URL (replacing the datatype for a known link with these examples) exists.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a bug or this boxes should point to another page but if not I think they should point to the correspoding detailed descriptions.\r\n\r\nData Types:\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/datatypes.html>\r\n\r\nSample Type Int 32:\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.int32.html#pyarrow.int32>\r\n\r\nField:\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.field.html>\r\n\r\nSchema:\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.schema.html>",
