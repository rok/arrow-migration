        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12694](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12694). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/actions/workflows/r.yml?query=branch%3Amaster, this started when ARROW-9697 (CountRows for Scanner) merged. It's only failing on rtools35 (aka gcc 4.9), and only on the 32-bit build (i386). Since there's no output about what failed, it's probably a segfault. The easiest way to get more information is to flip this `if: false` to true and let it print detailed output about where it was when it died https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/.github/workflows/r.yml#L186",

That said, I know David had found another problem with CountRows after merging, and just because we won't have to support this exact compiler version much longer doesn't mean there isn't an issue there. \r\n\r\nIt does probably make sense to timebox the work looking into this if there's not an obvious issue. Past experience setting up gdb to debug further on this toolchain has been fruitless."

I can submit a PR to do something like that (maybe with a #ifdef) to get things passing again."
