This only seems to affect 0.14.x\u00a0 - it works fine for me in 0.13.0. It might be related to earlier similar issues? e.g.\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2624>\r\n\r\nBelow is a reprex which works in earlier versions, but crashes on read (writing is fine) in this one. The real-life version of the data is full of URLs as the strings.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWeirdly it crashes my 32GB Ubuntu 18.04, but runs (if very slowly for the read) on my 16GB Macbook.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks so much for the excellent tools!\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nn_rows = int(1e6)\r\nn_cols = 10\r\ncol_length = 100\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\r\n\r\nfor i in range(n_cols):\r\n    df[f'col_{i}'] = pd.util.testing.rands_array(col_length, n_rows)\r\n\r\nprint('Generated df', df.shape)\r\nfilename = 'tmp.parquet'\r\n\r\nprint('Writing parquet')\r\ndf.to_parquet(filename)\r\n\r\nprint('Reading parquet')\r\npd.read_parquet(filename)\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
