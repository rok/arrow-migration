        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15040](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15040). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, this code fails:\r\n```r\n\r\ndataset <- open_dataset(\"some/folder/with/parquet/files\")\r\nwrite_csv_arrow(dataset, sink = \"dataset.csv\")\r\n```\r\nwith this error message:\r\n```r\n\r\nError: x must be an object of class 'data.frame', 'RecordBatch', or 'Table', not 'FileSystemDataset'.\r\n```\r\nIn ARROW-14741, support was added for reading from a RecordBatchReader, so we should be able to now extend `write_csv_arrow()` to allow this behaviour.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote: We would need to make sure whatever write_csv(record_batch_reader) function can take a filesystem= argument",
