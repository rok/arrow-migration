Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe tidyselect `vars_select`\u00a0and `vars_rename` functions are on their way to being deprecated. Switch to using the newer\u00a0`eval_select` and `eval_rename` functions. This is required to use the `where()` selection helper (ARROW-12778) Unfortunately this is not a trivial task.",
