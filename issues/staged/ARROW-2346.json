I try:\r\n```bash\n\r\nPYARROW_CXXFLAGS=\"-Wextra -Wconversion\" python setup.py build\r\n```\r\n\r\nand get the following error:\r\n```bash\n\r\n[ 22%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/plasma.dir/plasma.cxx.o\r\ng++-4.9: error: unrecognized command line option '-Wextra -Wconversion'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason it seems command expansion doesn't work properly. \"`-Wextra -Wconversion`\" is passed as a single argument instead of two separate ones...",
