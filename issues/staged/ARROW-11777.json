Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current implementation of Arrow forces the users to pass a reference to the append_value methods of StringBuilder/BinaryBuilder. Whereas it is passed by value for other types of builders.\u00a0 This patch suggests adding\u00a0impl AsRef<[u8]> rather than the current &[u8] parameter. \r\n\r\nSome background for this issue: I have a Rust derive macro which converts the specified struct to Arrow data. This macro assumes everything is passed by value to Arrow, hence the\u00a0dilemma.\u00a0",
