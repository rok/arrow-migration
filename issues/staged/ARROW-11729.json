Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are currently very few examples in the documentation (we have some in vignettes, though those have a slightly different audience). \r\n\r\nOne specific addition would be to show how `group_by(vars) %>% write_dataset(...)` is the same as `write_dataset(..., partitioning = c(vars))`",
