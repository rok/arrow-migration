However, I currently don't quite understand why decimal values are encoded as fixed size binary arrays of size 10 when reading from parquet. I am able to reconstruct the decimal value when I omit the first two bytes, but this feels very fishy to me.\r\n\r\nCould you point me in the direction of some documentation or existing implementation as to how I can properly decode a decimal value?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers!"
