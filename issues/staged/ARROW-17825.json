Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI had the need to write an ORC file little by little, so as to not consume too much memory.\r\nFollowing [this](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14211) discussion, it appeared that the API did not seemed to prevent doing that, but that the internal implementation was not reusing the writer accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the needed changes to reuse the \"writer_\" correctly.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the preceding behaviour was correct, as calling several time the \"Write\" method would lead to incorrect ORC files.",
