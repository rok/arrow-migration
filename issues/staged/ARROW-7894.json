Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeveral build options are mirrored as preprocessor definitions, for example \\`ARROW_JEMALLOC`. This could be made more consistent by requiring that every option in DefineOptions should also define a preprocessor macro with `add_definitions`.",
