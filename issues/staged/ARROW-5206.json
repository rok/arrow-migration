        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5206](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5206). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems there no APIs to directly write ArrowBuf to OutputStream or read ArrowBuf from InputStream. These APIs may be helpful when users use Vectors directly instead of RecordBatch, in this case, provide APIs to serialize/deserialize dataBuffer/validityBuffer/offsetBuffer is necessary.\r\n\r\nI would like to work on this and make it my first contribution to Arrow. What do you think?",
