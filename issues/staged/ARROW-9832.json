        "title": "[Rust] [DataFusion] Refactor PhysicalPlan to remove Partition",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9832](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9832). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a step towards supporting an improved threading model, I would like to refactor to remove the redundant `Partition` trait. The implementations of these partition traits really just duplicate the state of their operator and just add the partition number. It would be better to just pass the partition number to the execute() method in the PhysicalPlan trait.\r\n\r\nThis means it will also be necessary for each ExecutionPlan to state its output partitioning (and this is needed for other reasons when we get into the physical optimizer).\r\n\r\nProposed trait:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n/// Partition-aware execution plan for a relation\r\npub trait ExecutionPlan: Debug {\r\n    /// Get the schema for this execution plan\r\n    fn schema(&self) -> SchemaRef;\r\n    /// Specifies the output partitioning of this execution plan\r\n    fn output_partitioning(&self) -> Partitioning;\r\n    /// Execute this plan for a single partition and return a stream of results\r\n    fn execute(&self, partition: usize) -> Result<Arc<Mutex<dyn RecordBatchReader + Send + Sync>>>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/// Partitioning schemes supported by operators.\r\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\r\npub enum Partitioning {\r\n    UnknownPartitioning(usize),\r\n}\r\n \n```",
