Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html#string-predicates and below. Since R's base string functions, as well as stringr/stringi, aren't generics that we can define methods for, this will probably make most sense within the context of a dplyr expression where we have more control over the evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis will require enabling utf8proc in the builds; there's already an rtools-package for it.",
