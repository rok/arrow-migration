Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ndev/merge_arrow_pr.py is a nifty tool, but due to the way it avoids use of a GitHub-sanctioned merge it frequently confuses newcomers who see \"closed\" instead of \"merged\" PRs.\r\n\r\nThis could be ameliorated by automatically adding a comment to the PR directly after the \"closed\" event explaining that the PR is in fact merged and linking to an full breakdown of our alternative git flow.\r\n\r\nAdditionally for visibility in contexts where only the PR headline is visible it'd be useful to attach a \"merged\" label and/or place a [MERGED] tag in the title",
