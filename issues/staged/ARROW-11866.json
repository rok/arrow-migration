        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11866). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n1. When starting a Flight Server with shut down signal (SIGTERM) and using `Ctrl + C` to terminate the server cause potential mutex deadlock in gRPC.\r\n \\* gcc (Debian 10.2.0-16) 10.2.0\r\n \\* grpc 1.33.1/C++\r\n\r\n2.\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/flight/test_server.cc>\u00a0This test case can be used as minimal code to re-produce the issue with above gRPC version and gcc version on Debian 10.2.0.\r\n\r\n3. Related gRPC issue is: <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/24884>\r\n\r\n4. I am wandering whether the way handling the signal is proper with gRPC here: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc#L881>\r\n\r\n5. The recommended way to use a completion queue: <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.35.0/examples/cpp/helloworld/greeter_async_server.cc>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFeel free to share your thoughts for this.",
