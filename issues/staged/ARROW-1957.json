        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1957](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1957). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe following code\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nn=3\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'x': range(n)}, index=pd.DatetimeIndex(start='2017-01-01', freq='1n', periods=n))\r\npq.write_table(pa.Table.from_pandas(df), '/tmp/t.parquet')\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n`ArrowInvalid: Casting from timestamp[ns] to timestamp[us] would lose data: 1483228800000000001`\r\n\r\nThe desired effect is that we can save nanosecond resolution without losing precision (e.g. conversion to ms).  Note that if `freq='1u'` is used, the code runs properly.",

I'm still not clear on **why** nanosecond resolution timestamps are deprecated - is that for performance reasons?  What are the medium-/long-term ramifications of using the deprecated option you mention?"
