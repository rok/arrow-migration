Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nthe Python docs show that we can pass, say, 1025 partitions\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/_modules/pyarrow/dataset.html\r\n\r\nbut in R this argument doesn't exist, it would be good to add this for arrow v4.0.0\r\n\r\nthis is useful, for example, with intl trade datasets:\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n# d = UN COMTRADE - World's bilateral flows 2019\r\n# 13,050,535 x 22 data.frame\r\nd %>%\r\n          group_by(Year, `Reporter ISO`, `Partner ISO`) %>%\r\n          write_dataset(\"parquet\", hive_style = F)\r\n\r\nError: Invalid: Fragment would be written into 12808 partitions. This exceeds the maximum of 1024\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
