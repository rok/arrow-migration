We should add some minor internal details, like padding all byte buffers to start and end on 8-byte boundaries (according to the Arrow spec memory will already be aligned and padded, but the serialized metadata may require padding bytes). This is a similar, but much more general version of a file layout compared with what we did in Feather (which has a schema and record batch headers in a single metadata chunk, but only a single record batch and no dictionaries \u2013 https://github.com/wesm/feather/blob/master/doc/FORMAT.md)."

I'm considering reworking the RecordBatch message. I find the flattened FieldNode and Buffer lists very error prone since there are various factors that influence the number of buffers returned for a FieldNode. I'd rather have a FieldNode tree mimicking the Schema and have a list of Buffers in each. That would be more explicit and easier to manipulate. It would also make bugs related to reading the buffers a lot more obvious. Right now it is easy to misattribute the buffers and not know about it."
