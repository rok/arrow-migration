        "title": "[Java][FlightRPC] FlightSQL JDBC precludes other JDBC drivers on the same JVM",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18296](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18296). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe contract of `java.sql.Driver/connect` says that the driver should return null if it realises it's the wrong kind of driver to handle the connection - unfortunately the override in `ArrowFlightJdbcDriver` throws an exception if the scheme isn't `arrow-flight` or `arrow-flight-sql`. So, if I'm trying to connect to (e.g.) postgres and the Arrow Flight driver happens to be first in the java.sql.DriverManager's list, I'll get a `URL Scheme must be 'arrow-flight'.` error.\r\n\r\nWe could consider a similar pattern to Avatica's `UnregisteredDriver/connect`, which checks ``acceptsURL`` first and returns null if appropriate?\r\n\r\n(Separately, I suspect that error message should say `arrow-flight-sql`, given `arrow-flight` seems to be deprecated?)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJames",
