Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe following functions do not support fixed size list (and should):\r\n\r\n - list_flatten\r\n - list_parent_indices (one could argue this doesn't need to be supported since this should be obvious and fixed_size_list doesn't have an indices array)\r\n - list_value_length (should be easy)\r\n\r\nFor reference, the following functions do correctly consume fixed_size_list (there may be more, this isn't an exhaustive list):\r\n\r\n - count\r\n - drop_null\r\n - is_null\r\n - is_valid",
