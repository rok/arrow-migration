Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`InternalFileDecryptor::WipeOutDecryptionKeys()` merely call `std::string::clear` to dispose of the decryption key contents, but that method is not guaranteed to clear memory (it probably doesn't, actually).\r\n\r\nWe should probably devise a portable wrapper function for the various OS-specific memory clearing utilities.",
