Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt'd be great to have a few high-level functions that implicitly create the Schema, RecordBatches, etc. from a Table and a list of Columns. For example:\r\n```actionscript\n\r\nconst table = Table.new(\r\n  Column.new('foo', ...),\r\n  Column.new('bar', ...)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n",
