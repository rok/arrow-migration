        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15624](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15624). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe strive to store all generated header files (by the Thrift or Flatbuffers compilers, for example) in `src/generated`. However, it seems that Flight puts its protocol buffers generated files in `<CMake build dir>/src/arrow/flight` and `<CMake build dir>/src/arrow/flight/sql`.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to eventually harmonize this.",
