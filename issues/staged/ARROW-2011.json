Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently try to import cloudpickle and failing that fall back to pickle. However, given that there are many versions of cloudpickle and they are typically incompatible with one another, the caller may want to specify a specific version, so we should allow them to set the specific pickler to use.",
