Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-17436, the RTools35 job is consistently failing with:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nError: Error: package or namespace load failed for 'arrow' in inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...):\r\n unable to load shared object 'D:/a/arrow/arrow/r/check/arrow.Rcheck/00LOCK-arrow/00new/arrow/libs/i386/arrow.dll':\r\n  LoadLibrary failure:  A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that there is a mailing list discussion about dropping support for that platform, should we disable the check? Or wait until that is resolved to disable the check?",
