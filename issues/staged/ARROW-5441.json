Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is required so that downstream CMake users can write:\r\n```Java\n\r\nfind_package(ArrowFlight)\r\n```\r\n\r\nto find the Flight library paths. In turn this will allow `PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP` to work with Arrow Flight.",
