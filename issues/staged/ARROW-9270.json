        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9270](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9270). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOne problem with slicing ResizableBuffer is that slices of a buffer that is still changing may be invalidated after a resize operation. I'd be interested in having a way to slice a ResizableBuffer where the slice is still usable after a resize. This would presume, of course, that the code responsible for the parent and child buffers behaves appropriately (e.g. if you call `child->data()` and then resize the parent, the pointer may become invalid",

Both producer and consumer would need to be aware of what the other is doing (e.g. this would not be safe for concurrent processing since a `const uint8_t*` could become invalid while it's being processed)"
