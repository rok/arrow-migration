Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we are accumulating a huge number of nightly java jars. We should prune them to keep max. 14 versions around. (see r_nightly.yml)\r\n\r\nIt might also be nice to always rename/copy the most recent jars to something fixed so there is no need to update your local config to always have the newest version?\u00a0 (but up to the java users if this is necessary/worth it).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\ncc `[~dsusanibara]` `[~ljw1001]` \u00a0",
