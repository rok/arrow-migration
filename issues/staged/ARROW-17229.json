        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17229](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17229). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, a Substrait plan with a RelRoot containing a ReadRel will contain extra, unexpected fields, namely `__fragment_index` et. al. Right now they are always included by default. There are a few things to be done:\r\n\r\n- ReadRel's `base_schema` could be converted into a `ScanOptions.dataset_schema` to limit the fields read. (Also see ARROW-15585, these fields should be used for pushdown projection)\n- The scanner always adds these extra fields - maybe it should be opt-in instead\n- There's no way to manually insert a Project to \"fix\" things because as implemented, it can only add new columns",
