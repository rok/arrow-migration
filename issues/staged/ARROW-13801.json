        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13801](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13801). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee also ARROW-13800. In R, both integer and float division by 0 results in Inf. Maybe that only makes sense because of how R finesses the difference between integer and float. But it would be nice if there were a way to achieve this behavior instead of failing with an error. (Or maybe that's the behavior we support: if you get an error, cast to float and retry?)",
