        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17182](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17182). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nToday, there is really only one feature-complete high-level API wrapping the lower-level Acero ExecPlan API: the dplyr interface arrow R pacakge. But in the future, when Acero has full capability to consume and execute Substrait plans, then will have more high-level APIs wrapping Acero, including Ibis. It would be nice to include a tabbed interface in a prominent place on the front page of the Acero docs showing several different Acero-compatible language APIs, similar to what's on the front page of the [Apache Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/). Credit to `[~willjones127]` \u00a0for suggesting this idea.",
