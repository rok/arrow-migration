        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10777](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10777). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDownloading the most recent pyarrow \"sdist\" **source** tarball from Pypi and upon extraction, the package contains multiple **binary**\u00a0libraries compiled for x86-64. (libarrow, libparquet, etc.)\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe ultimate result is that this isn't a source package at all - it would be fine to include binaries in a python wheel but including arch/platform specific binaries in a sdist breaks pip and the install. (In my case, trying to install on aarch64.)\r\n\r\nAs a general observation, this will become a larger issue as, for example, the ARM-based Macs come to market.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThat said, one commonly implemented option is to make the python source package download and build any dependent libraries.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt the very least, the source package should not contain binaries. I suppose it's not much different from a **source** Debian package containing compiled binary code.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

(Don't delete the 2.0.0 version.) I don't have enough permission for it.\r\nWe can't re-upload a sdist for 2.0.0 because PyPI doesn't accept it.\r\nIs it OK that we solve this in the next release?\r\n\r\nWe can't override and remove PyPI"
