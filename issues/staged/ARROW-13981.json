Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLooks like the buffer copy logic doesn't work for\u00a0BitVector, even though the\u00a0BitVector is from\u00a0BaseFixedWidthVector. I created two\u00a0VectorSchemaRoot (target empty), calling\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nVectorSchemaRootAppender.append(target, source);\n```\r\nthen reading from the target didn't give me correct result.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHope to get confirmation from experts that this is a problem in Apache Arrow, if yes, wondering if there is a workaround (tried using\u00a0copyFromSafe as well and it doesn't work either)",

The fundamental reason is that the `BitVector` has a type width of 0, so a special implementation is required for it.\r\nIf this problem blocks you, I think you can work around by using `BitVectorHelper#concatBits`, which efficiently concats two bit buffers.

I did more testing and seems like there is also problem for other types of vectors (DecimalVector, Float8Vector, etc.), I would suggest to test all vector types when you have time for the fix. For now, I'm using CopyFrom to copy the data row by row."
