Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn demand of better performance, quite some end users want to leverage accelerators (e.g. FPGA, Intel QAT) to offload compression. However, in current Arrow compression framework, it only supports codec name based compression implementation and can't be customized to leverage accelerators. For example, for gzip format, we can't call customized codec to accelerate the compression. We would like to proposal a plugin API to support the customized compression codec.",
