The former portion has been also used for PostgreSQL connector (Arrow_Fdw), so it is preferable to package as an independent library for native-C language.\r\n\r\nOn the other hands, I have to focus on software quality improvement of PG-Strom for the next 2-3 months. I expect the progress will not be quick enough.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"

We can of course discuss further on the mailing list\r\n\r\nMy particular interest would be making this software accessible to users of the Arrow libraries in languages like Python and R"
