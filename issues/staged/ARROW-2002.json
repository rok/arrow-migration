        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2002](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2002). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we download file from hdfs, if the speed writer thread write data is slower than read speed, download() will raise queue.Fulll exceptions, because write_queue is full.\r\n\r\nI think when we download file, we can wait until write_queue has space to enqueue new item if writer_thread is alive. Like what upload() does.\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> cli = pa.hdfs.connect(user='USERNAME')\r\n>>> cli.download('/REMOTE/HDFS/PATH', '/LOCAL/FILE/PATH')\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"pyarrow/io-hdfs.pxi\", line 428, in pyarrow.lib.HadoopFileSystem.download (/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.4/lib.cxx:66399)\r\n  File \"pyarrow/io-hdfs.pxi\", line 429, in pyarrow.lib.HadoopFileSystem.download (/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.4/lib.cxx:66351)\r\n  File \"pyarrow/io.pxi\", line 315, in pyarrow.lib.NativeFile.download (/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.4/lib.cxx:52249)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/queue.py\", line 187, in put_nowait\r\n    return self.put(item, block=False)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/queue.py\", line 133, in put\r\n    raise Full\r\nqueue.Full\r\n```",
