Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am looking at using Gandiva's Python bindings in an experimental project, and noticed there aren't any Sphinx docs. Assuming it's not too early, I would be willing to add documentation in Sphinx.\r\n\r\nTwo starting points for documentation:\r\n \\* A how-to for creating filters and projections using the builders. The first part of this blog post gives the right idea: <https://blog.christianperone.com/2020/01/gandiva-using-llvm-and-arrow-to-jit-and-evaluate-pandas-expressions/>\r\n \\* API reference. If possible, it would be cool to have a table listing all of the available functions in the registry.",

Missed that Gandiva was dropped from latest wheels (in a PR that shrunk the size of wheels: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7334>). So it may be worth waiting on this until we create a separate wheel, as per https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8518."

I though to limit number of variables to three and use predefined values to simplify the code."
