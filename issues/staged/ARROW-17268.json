For parsing, the problem is we need to know the output schema without being able to look at the data, so we would probably only be able to decode into a `map[string, union]` type at best. And/or we could offer \"extraction\" functions akin to what things like SQLite and Postgres provide (at the cost of having to reparse the JSON over and over).\r\n\r\nAlso see ARROW-17255 for a logical JSON type.",
