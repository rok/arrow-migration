Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have `assume_timezone` to go from wall time timestamp to timestamp with a timezone. We might want a reverse operation to go from timestamp with a timezone to wall time.\r\n\r\nThis is not needed for computation within Arrow, but would be needed if an application outsides of Arrow consumes wall time.
