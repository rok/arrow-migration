Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFlight benchmark performs worse when working threads increases. It can be improved by setting gRPC option GRPC_ARG_USE_LOCAL_SUBCHANNEL_POOL to make each client creating its own TCP connection to server, without sharing one connection.\r\nWe can add a cmdline parameter to enable/disable TCP connection sharing.\r\n\r\nDetails at https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r37ae0e5139d86a17fb50891ce7430c6bfd07979183d6ec335d2bc92e%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E",
