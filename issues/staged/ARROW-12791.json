        "title": "[R] Better error handling for DatasetFactory$Finish() when no format specified",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12791](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12791). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I call the following code:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ntf <- tempfile()\r\ndir.create(tf)\r\non.exit(unlink(tf))\r\nwrite_csv_arrow(mtcars[1:5,], file.path(tf, \"file1.csv\"))\r\nwrite_csv_arrow(mtcars[6:11,], file.path(tf, \"file2.csv\"))\r\nds <- open_dataset(c(file.path(tf, \"file1.csv\"), file.path(tf, \"file2.csv\")))\r\n```\r\nI get the following error:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n Error: IOError: Could not open parquet input source '/tmp/RtmpSug6P8/file714931976ac54/file1.csv': Invalid: Parquet magic bytes not found in footer. Either the file is corrupted or this is not a parquet file.\r\n```\r\nHowever, in the documentation for open_dataset(), there is nothing saying that the input source cannot be a CSV or must be a Parquet file.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nI think this is due to calling DataSetFactory$Finish() when schema is NULL and input files have no inherent schema (i.e. are CSVs).",
