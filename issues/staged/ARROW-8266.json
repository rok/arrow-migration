Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs we've seen a number of times, most recently with boost, our builds sometimes fail because of a failure to download bundled dependencies. To reduce this risk, we can add alternate URLs to the cmake externalprojects, so that it will attempt to download from the second location if the first fails (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html). This feature is available in cmake >=3.7. ",
