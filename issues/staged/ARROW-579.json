Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently wheels build on OSX cannot be passed between different machines as they link to system installed libraries. There are tools to ease building these wheels (e.g. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/delocate ) but they currently don't work well with `pyarrow`.",
