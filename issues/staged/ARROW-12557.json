Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen running `pytest` with pyarrow 4.0.0 on a Windows 10 VM, I noticed that the `test_s3_proxy_options` test takes an extraordinarily long time to finish. This is mostly because each call to `S3FileSystem` with `proxy_options` takes about a minute to finish.\r\n\r\nFYI `[~sahil1105]`",

(test_s3_proxy_options IIRC stood out to me as a very slow test in that PR as well, but setting the env var described there fixed that.)"
