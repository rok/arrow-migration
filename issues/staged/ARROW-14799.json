        "title": "[C++] Adding tabular pretty printing of Table / RecordBatch",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14799](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14799). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be nice to show a \"preview\" (eg xx number of first and last rows) of a Table or RecordBatch in a traditional tabular form (like pandas DataFrames, or R data.frame / tibbles have, or in a format that resembles markdown tables). \r\n\r\nThis could also be added in the bindings, but we could also do it on the C++ level to benefit multiple bindings at once.\r\n\r\nBased on a quick search, there is https://github.com/p-ranav/tabulate which could be vendored (it has a single-include version).\r\n\r\nI suppose that nested data types could represent a challenge on how to include those in a tabular format, though.",
