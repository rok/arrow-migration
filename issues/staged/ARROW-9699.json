        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9699](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9699). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMode kernel usesl hash table to count distinct values. For small integer types (bool, int8, uint8), counting directly with a value indexed array can be more efficient. This card is to evaluate the approach and upstream patch if workable.",
