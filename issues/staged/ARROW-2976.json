This works fine for installed versions, but It should be looking in something like `sys.exec_prefix/lib` which would work for locally built pyarrow clones if the arrow C++ libraries are installed in the same place as Python and it should continue to work for installed versions as well."

My plan to fix this is to see if pkg-config knows about arrow, and if yes, add the directory to\u00a0get_library_dirs. This should cover all cases where libarrow.so has been installed and is not shipped with pyarrow itself.\r\n\r\nI also agree on the plan for getting Ray running against a released version. At the moment we are busy with releasing the new backend, but after that's done I'm happy to look into it."

Since there are a number of accumulated bug fixes (or reports that need to be fixed soon) already there's a good chance we might make a point release within a few weeks anyway. It won't be 4 months til the next release. "
