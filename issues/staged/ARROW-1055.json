Initially, arrow needs to handle device memory pointer only and it doesn't need to deal with device IPC handles.   The schema is usually small that it is okay to be processed on the host side.  For the recordbatches, it is best to keep the payload on the device.  \n\nEDIT: \nAdding a reference to gpu arrow deserializer implementation in libgdf: https://github.com/gpuopenanalytics/libgdf/blob/master/src/ipc.cu"

As a way to get started (separate from GPU-related development), I might suggest picking up an issue or two to learn more about the existing Arrow codebases and memory / data model. \n\nI have no prior record of e-mails from you, are you subscribed to dev@arrow.apache.org? Thanks"
