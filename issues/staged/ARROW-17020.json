        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17020](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17020). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGcsFileSystem will attempt to retry if it gets a non-permanent error (such as couldn't connect to server). That's fine, except: (1) the sleep call used by the retry doesn't seem to check for interrupts and (2) the default retry timeout is 15 minutes!\r\n\r\nThe following snippets will hang for 15 minutes if you run them and wait about 5 seconds before trying to do a keyboard interrupt (CTRL+C):\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\nRscript -e 'library(arrow); fs <- GcsFileSystem$create(endpoint_override=\"localhost:1234\", anonymous=TRUE); fs$CreateDir(\"x\")'\r\n\r\npython -c 'from pyarrow.fs import GcsFileSystem; fs = GcsFileSystem(endpoint_override=\"localhost:1234\", anonymous=True); fs.create_dir(\"x\")'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

If we choose to implement a different default retry timeout to solve this issue, these docs should be modified accordingly."
