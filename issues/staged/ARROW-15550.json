Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt could be useful to allow enabling memory checks at runtime (e.g. check that memory was not written out of bounds when a MemoryPool deallocates a buffer). For example an environment variable setting `ARROW_DEBUG_MEMORY_POOL=(warn|trap|abort)`\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12216 for inspiration\r\n",

That said, we could at least enable those compile-time options when Arrow itself is compiled in debug mode."
