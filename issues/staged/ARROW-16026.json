        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16026). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe SerialExecutor can currently serialize a future-returning task by running it in an event loop style executor.\r\n\r\nThis JIRA is to add support for serializing an async-generator task by turning it into an iterator.  Each time the iterator is polled the generator will be polled and the event loop will run until an item is delivered and the event loop is exhausted.",
