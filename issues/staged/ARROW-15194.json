Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nChunkedArray constructors are inconsistent wrt to validating if input is empty and has an omitted type. The constructors can be merged into a single one via function overloading and include such validation. Constructors do not validate same type chunks for performance reasons, but this validation is performed via `ChunkedArray::Make()`.",
