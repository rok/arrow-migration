Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis seems to be the cause of the test failures in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2322\r\n\r\nModifying `getSingleRecordBatchTable` to [generate its vectors programmatically](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2322/files#diff-eb6e5955a00e92f7bebb15a03f8437d1R359) (rather than deserializing hard-coded JSON), causes the new round-trip tests added in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2638 to fail. The root cause seems to be that an ID is never allocated for the generated dictionary.",
