        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11036](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11036). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the CSVReader will only infer number of columns if it also attempts to infer types. This should be decoupled so that a user can easily extract a fully Utf8 typed CSV with the number of columns matching the input file. The user can then do CAST() or equivalent to control the parsing.",
