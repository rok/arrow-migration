        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11116](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11116). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the left join implementation keeps a HashSet<Vec<u8>> to mark each key as visited.\r\n\r\nHowever, a more efficient choice would be to keep a bitmap or a boolean marker for each key or index and mark the row as visited, avoiding unnecessary hashing, copying / memory usage.\r\n\r\nThis bitmap / marker can be visited at the end of the join, efficiently adding the remaining left rows with no match.",
