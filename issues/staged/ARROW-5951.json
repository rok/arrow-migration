Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\n[root@0b415e11a9ba multibuild]# cpython_path 2.7 16\r\n/opt/python/cp27-cp27m\r\n[root@0b415e11a9ba multibuild]# cpython_path 2.7 32\r\n/opt/python/cp27-cp27mu\r\n[root@0b415e11a9ba multibuild]# cpython_path 3.7 16\r\n/opt/python/cp37-cp37m\r\n[root@0b415e11a9ba multibuild]# cpython_path 3.7 32\r\n/opt/python/cp37-cp37m\r\n```\r\nWe should actually change the unicode_with properties in the tasks.yml to 32 for python wheels > 2.7, because we'll always produce ucs4 wheels, and it is quite misleading that we request 16 bit ones.\r\n\r\nMultibuild does the conversion https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild/blob/devel/manylinux_utils.sh#L26",
