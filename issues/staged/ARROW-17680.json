Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've just updated to the newer version of the merge script, and something is going wrong; however, the error message I'm getting isn't super-helpful for working out what's happened: \r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n  File \"/home/nic2/arrow_for_merging_prs_only/dev/merge_arrow_pr.py\", line 539, in connect_jira\r\n    return jira.client.JIRA(options={'server': JIRA_API_BASE},\r\nTypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'token_auth'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there some object we could just dump the output of, in cases of failure, so it provides a few more hints to work out what's gone wrong?  \r\n",
