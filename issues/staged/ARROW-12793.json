Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `PYARROW_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` is not actually enabling debug mode in Cython files due to the fact that the `UseCython` cmake extension is case sensitively checking for `\"Debug\"` and `\"RelWithDebInfo\"` but `PYARROW_BUILD_TYPE` is getting lowercased in `setup.py` so it can never be equal to the capitalised string.",
