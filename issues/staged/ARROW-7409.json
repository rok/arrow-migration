Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I build arrow_python on Windows in debug mode it raises a link error \"`LNK1104: cannot open file 'python37_d.lib'\".`\r\n\r\nI have been having a look at the CMake files and it seems that we are forcing to link against release python lib on debug mode.\r\n\r\nI have edited the CMake files in order to fix this bug, see [fix-msvc-link-python-debug.patch](fix-msvc-link-python-debug.patch).\r\n\r\nIt is just a 3 lines change and makes the debug version of arrow_python link on Windows.\r\nI could do a PR if you find it useful.",
