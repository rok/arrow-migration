Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen PYARROW_INSTALL_TESTS is set to 0, the packages keyword to setuptools.setup is:\r\n\r\n`find_namespace_packages(include=['pyarrow*'], exclude=[\"pyarrow.tests*\"])`\r\n\r\nSince pyarrow.conftest is associated with the tests, I think it should be added to the list of modules to exclude in this case, i.e.,\r\n\r\n`find_namespace_packages(include=['pyarrow*'], exclude=[\"pyarrow.tests*\", \"pyarrow.conftest\"])`\r\n\r\n(As a separate issue, it doesn\u2019t seem like any of these excludes is having any effect for me anyway, as I find the tests are still included in wheels no matter what.)",

This one of the warnings I get when debugging excluding the test from wheels or otherwise.
