Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollow-up to ARROW-13993, which implemented `hash_one` to select an arbitrary value, as the core engine lack support for ordering. I think `first` and `last` will still be in demand though, based on pandas and sql usage.\r\n\r\nIt could be done without core changes by using `min_max` on an array of indices. For that reason, maybe it would be better as `hash_\\{first,last}_index`, suitable for use with `take`.",
