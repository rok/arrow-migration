        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10503). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFix for the Uriparser header file. The macro \"URI_INLINE\" was defined to \"__force_inline\", however the intel compiler keyword is now \"__forceinline\". Because of this change, the Intel compiler was no longer recognizing the keyword, which caused the whole build to fail. The patch is just changing this one line in the UriDefsConfig.h file from\r\n```cpp\n\r\n# define URI_INLINE __force_inline\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```cpp\n\r\n# define URI_INLINE __forceinline\r\n```\r\nThe source for the new key word can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/cpp-compiler-developer-guide-and-reference/top/compiler-reference/compiler-options/compiler-option-details/inlining-options/inline-forceinline-qinline-forceinline.html).\r\nI have a fork ready to make a pull request.",

Unfortunately, I don't have the documentation for the compilers older than 19, but my stack is built on 18 (the version denotes the year for the Intel compilers) and it still worked. I think it is unlikely enough that people are using version older than 18, so I feel comfortable enough not checking, and I wouldn't even know where the cutoff for using the old syntax would be because they don't say online. Frankly, the Intel historical documentation is terrible, and I'm unable to find anything online for any version older than the newest."
