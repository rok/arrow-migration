Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor the general documentation of Arrow, we want to use asciidoc. The \"general documentation\" includes:\n \\* The Arrow spec / memory layout\n \\* Howtos for building arrow on different platforms\n \\* Getting Started snippets for each language and a link to the (to-be-build) API documentation\n\nIt would be nice to have a build system and the main file/folder structure in place so we can split the work up.",

Probably we should raise that on the ML? At least a mail with the rough idea of how the documentation should be structured?"

As an example of this, named anchors don't really work in Markdown (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6695439/how-do-you-create-link-to-a-named-anchor-in-multimarkdown), and solutions for them are HTML-specific. What if we want to generate a PDF? Maybe this need is hard to anticipate, but I'm not very comfortable using Markdown for more than READMEs and blogs (e.g. Jekyll / Pelican). \n\nFolks with more Markdown experience making more complex documentation should comment on their experience and how much Markdown's limitations (as compared with rst / adoc) end up being problems.
