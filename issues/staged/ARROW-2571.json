        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2571](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2571). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor example a following closure test will fail:\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\ndata = [pa.array([None] * 10)]\r\nbatch = pa.RecordBatch.from_arrays(data, ['x'])\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_batches([batch])\r\npq.write_table(table, \"test.parquet\", compression='LZ4')\r\ntable = pq.read_table(\"test.parquet\")\r\n```\r\nwith a following error\r\n```java\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"test.py\", line 8, in <module> table = pq.read_table(\"test.parquet\") File \"python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py\", line 987, in read_table use_pandas_metadata=use_pandas_metadata) File \"python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py\", line 149, in read nthreads=nthreads) File \"_parquet.pyx\", line 736, in pyarrow._parquet.ParquetReader.read_all File \"error.pxi\", line 83, in pyarrow.lib.check_status pyarrow.lib.ArrowIOError: Arrow error: IOError: Corrupt Lz4 compressed data.\r\n```\r\nWriting file from with LZ4 from python requires patch for ARROW-2570. But the issue can be reproduced by creating an input file with parquet-cpp. The file must be compressed with LZ4 and contain a column with only gap values.",
