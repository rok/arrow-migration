Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the query `COUNT(*)` is being converted to `COUNT(1)` during logical planning, which causes the field's name to be `COUNT(1)`, not `COUNT(*)`\r\n\r\n\u00a0One idea is to delay the map for the physical planning, when naming is no longer an issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
