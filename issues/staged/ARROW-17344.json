Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter building Arrow from source, with ORC enabled and retrieved from a package manager, I went to build some software that did not use ORC, and was unable to compile because ORC was not found by Arrow internals, and I didn't include ORC in my final CMake file (the one for my Arrow-using program), because I simply wasn't using it.\r\n\r\nI rebuilt Arrow without ORC for now, but the ability to include ORC as a feature in Arrow and not have to include it in future CMakes when ORC isn't in use would be nice.",

Maybe it just grabbed the include path correctly this time. I'll switch the status until someone can reproduce this."
