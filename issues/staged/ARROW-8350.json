Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe support `to_numpy` on Array instances but not on `ChunkedArray` instances. It would be quite useful to have it also there to support returning e.g. non-nanosecond datetime instances.",
