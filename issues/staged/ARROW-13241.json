        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13241](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13241). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[The current versions of the aws-sdk-cpp and aws-c-common](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/thirdparty/versions.txt#L28-L31) fail to build on GCC 11. [There have been fixes](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common/pull/798) that resolve this upstream, so we should be good once we bump the versions.\r\n\r\nOne complication is that aws-sdk-cpp v 1.9 and above have a different method of installing dependencies https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp#version-19-is-now-available that requires either git, using a (provided) shell script to grab the correct dependencies, or managing all of the dependencies on our own.",
