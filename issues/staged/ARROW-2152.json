Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd a UUID type that is physically represented as an 128bit fixed sized binary. The addition of the type should add the annotation that a value in this\u00a0column\u00a0is a UUID. The important benefit would be that in the native language object models we could return the respective UUID class, e.g. `java.util.UUID`\u00a0in Java and `uuid.UUID`\u00a0in Python. For reference, Postgres and Parquet both have a UUID type as well do other data system have this small specialization.",
