Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe [installation instructions](https://arrow.apache.org/install/) list the following command for Debian and Ubuntu installation:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nsudo apt install -y -V lsb-release wget\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, on a base Debian system configured to not install recommended packages, that results in wget producing the following error:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nroot@buster:~# wget https://apache.bintray.com/arrow/$(lsb_release --id --short | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')/apache-arrow-archive-keyring-latest-$(lsb_release --codename --short).deb\r\n--2020-05-26 18:35:52--  https://apache.bintray.com/arrow/debian/apache-arrow-archive-keyring-latest-buster.deb\r\nResolving apache.bintray.com (apache.bintray.com)... 52.38.12.101, 50.112.155.255\r\nConnecting to apache.bintray.com (apache.bintray.com)|52.38.12.101|:443... connected.\r\nERROR: The certificate of 'apache.bintray.com' is not trusted.\r\nERROR: The certificate of 'apache.bintray.com' doesn't have a known issuer.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to have the ca-certificates package installed for wget to be able to verify the issuer and server certificate.  The wget package recommends, but does not depend on, ca-certificates, so the documentation should include it in the supplied command line.\r\n\r\nThe command should be updated to:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nsudo apt install -y -V lsb-release wget ca-certificates\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
