Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome third-party projects like Thrift display a nice and useful summary of the build configuration at the end of the CMake configuration run:\r\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/pitrou/arrow/build/job/mgi68rvk0u5jf2s4?fullLog=true#L2325\r\n\r\nIt may be good to have a similar thing in Arrow as well. Bonus points if, for each configuration item, it says which CMake variable can be used to influence it.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n```Java\n\r\n-- Build ZSTD support:             ON  [change using ARROW_WITH_ZSTD]\r\n-- Build BZ2 support:              OFF [change using ARROW_WITH_BZ2]\r\n```\r\n",
