        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8105](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8105). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```python\n\r\n>>> import numpy as np, pyarrow as pa                               \r\n>>> pa.array(np.ma.array([0]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI **think** the issue might be here because when the masked array has a shrunken mask, it's values is False rather than the boolean mask array.\r\n```python\n\r\n        if isinstance(values, np.ma.MaskedArray):\r\n            if mask is not None:\r\n                raise ValueError(\"Cannot pass a numpy masked array and \"\r\n                                 \"specify a mask at the same time\")\r\n            else:\r\n                mask = values.mask\r\n                values = values.data\r\n```",

I wouldn't recommend building applications based on them nowadays since the level of support / compatibility in other projects is low. "
