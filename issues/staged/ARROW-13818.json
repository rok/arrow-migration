Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe attached dataframe with a few records fails to load properly when using the JS arrow library. When inspecting the loaded content, the string values seem to include characters before the actual start of the string. Loading a large file like this is also extremely slow.\r\n\r\nThe file was generated using the latest pandas and pyarrow versions. To rule out platform dependent issues with writing the file, the same file was computed and written on Windows 10 and linux. Both files were binary identical and loaded without issues in pandas.",
