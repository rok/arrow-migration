Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n(We cannot do this until we have basic SQL JOIN working)\r\n\r\nA **NATURAL JOIN** is a **JOIN** operation that creates an implicit **join** clause for you based on the common columns in the two tables being **joined**. Common columns are columns that have the same name in both tables. A **NATURAL JOIN** can be an INNER **join**, a LEFT OUTER **join**, or a RIGHT OUTER **join**. The default is INNER **join**.",
