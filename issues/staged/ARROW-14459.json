Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently have sphinx pinned to 3.1.2 because of ARROW-9693. That compatibility issue with breathe has been solved, so we can update the sphinx version we are using (I think it is good to still keep it \"pinned\" at a recent version, since sphinx upgrades tend to break something from time to time).",
