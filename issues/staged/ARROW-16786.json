        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16786](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16786). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/overview.html#pull-request-and-review\r\n\r\n> A side effect of this way of merging is that your pull request will appear in the GitHub interface to have been \u201cclosed without merge\u201d. Do not be alarmed: if you look at the bottom, you will see a message that says @user closed this in $COMMIT. In the commit message of that commit, the merge tool adds the pull request description, a link back to the pull request, and attribution to the contributor and any co-authors.\r\n\r\nWe have changed to use the \"merge\" feature of GitHub by ARROW-16602 to show \"merged\" mark not \"closed without merge\" mark on GitHub. We should update the note.\r\n\r\n`[~alenkaf]` Do you want to work on this?",
