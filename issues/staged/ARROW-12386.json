Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhether we pull from files in parallel or not is controlled by how we merge the batch streams in `AsyncScanner::ScanBatchesUnorderedAsync`.\u00a0 Currently we are relying on `MakeConcatenatedGenerator` which is incorrect.\u00a0 This is needed because `MakeMergedGenerator` pulls from its source (an `EnumeratingGenerator`) in an async reentrant fashion.\u00a0 `MakeMergedGenerator` should not do this.\u00a0 If some kind of readahead is truly necessary there then use `MakeReadaheadGenerator`.",
