Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed that Travis CI will soldier onward if a step in its `script:` block fails. This wastes build time when there is an error somewhere early on in the testing process\r\n\r\nFor example, in the main C++ build, if `travis_script_cpp.sh` fails, then the subsequent steps will continue.\r\n\r\nIt seems the way to deal with this is to add `|| travis_terminate 1` to lines that can fail\r\n\r\nsee\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@manjula.cse/how-to-stop-the-execution-of-travis-pipeline-if-script-exits-with-an-error-f0e5a43206bf\r\n\r\nI also found this discussion\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1066",

According to comments of the linked issue, Travis will\u00a0only mark your build as failed only if the last script returned non-zero (essentially behaving like a pipe). I'd recommend moving to the rust technique\u00a0https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/12513/files"
