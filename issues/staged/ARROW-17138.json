        "title": "[Python] Converting data frame to Table with large nested column fails `Invalid Struct child array has length smaller than expected`",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17138](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17138). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHey,\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have a data frame for which one column is a nested struct array. Converting it to a `pyarrow.Table` fails if the data frame gets too big. I could reproduce the bug with a minimal example with anonymized data that is roughly similar to mine. When I set, e.g., `N_ROWS=500_000`, or smaller, it is working fine.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\nN_ROWS = 800_000\r\nitem_record = {\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \"someImportantAssets\": [\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 {\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"square\": \"https://some.super.loooooooooong.link.com/withmany/lorem/upload/ipsum/stilllooooooooooonger/lorem/\\{someparameter}/156fdjjf644984dfdfaera648/specificLink-i15348891\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ],\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \"id\": \"i15348891\",\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \"title\": \"Some Long Item Title i15348891\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nuser_record = {\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \"userId\": \"faa4648-4964drf-64648fafa648-4648falj\",\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \"data\": [item_record for _ in range(24)],\r\n}\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame([user_record for _ in range(N_ROWS)])\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python-traceback\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/table.pxi\", line 1658, in pyarrow.lib.Table.from_pandas\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/table.pxi\", line 1702, in pyarrow.lib.Table.from_arrays\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/table.pxi\", line 1314, in pyarrow.lib.Table.validate\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 99, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Column 1: In chunk 0: Invalid: List child array invalid: Invalid: Struct child array #1 invalid: Invalid: List child array invalid: Invalid: Struct child array #0 has length smaller than expected for struct array (13256071 < 13256072)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe length is always smaller than expected by 1.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n## Expected behavior:\r\n\r\nRun without errors or fail with a better error message.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n## System Info and Versions:\r\n\r\nApple M1 Pro but also happened on amd64 Linux machine on AWS\r\n\r\n```\r\narrow-cpp \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7.0.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 py39h8a997f0_8_cpu \u00a0 \u00a0conda-forge\r\npyarrow \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7.0.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 py39h3a11367_8_cpu \u00a0 \u00a0conda-forge\r\n\r\npython \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03.9.7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 h54d631c_3_cpython \u00a0 \u00a0conda-forge\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce with `pyarrow 8.0.0`",
