        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5057](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5057). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[Class BaseValueVector](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/BaseValueVector.java)\u00a0's method\u00a0allocFixedDataAndValidityBufs on line#162 allocates a buffer in power of 2 size. After that, it has a code to release extra buffer. For that, it calculates the extra buffer from allocated size \"bufferSize\" but in my opinion, it should take original \"valueCount\" to find the extra buffer size.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere, I see a problem in line#162, where its taking \"bufferSize\" to find the extra allocated bytes. It should be \"valueCount\\*typeWidth + valueCount/8\".\r\n\r\nHere is an\u00a0example for that. Let's take 1000 ints. Then,\r\n valueCount = 1000 ints\r\n typeWidth = 4 bytes\r\n validitiyBufferSize = 125 bytes\r\n valueBufferSize = 4000 bytes\r\n combinedSize(valueBufferSize + validityBufferSize) = 4128 bytes (multiple of 8)\r\n combinedSizeWith2ThePowerSize = 8192 bytes, this will be \"bufferSize\" at line#152.\r\n\r\nWith the above calculation, this code should release (combinedSizeWith2ThePowerSize - combinedSize) = 4064 bytes. But, this is not happening.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
