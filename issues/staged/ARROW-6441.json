This one is for Centos 6, with the doubleconversion issue. But in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5285#issuecomment-528210038 you said \r\n\r\n> CentOS 7 build is succeeded.\r\n> CentOS 6 build is failed but it's a problem of double-conversion. This is unrelated.\r\n \r\nApologies if I misunderstood or if you have this covered elsewhere, just didn't want to lose track of the Centos 6 issue."
