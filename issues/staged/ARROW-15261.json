Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe approach taken here will depend on the approach taken by ARROW-12311.  If ScanOptions is completely hidden then we need a way to create a scan node from a ScannerBuilder and a Dataset.  On the other hand, if we get rid of ScannerBuilder and only have ScanOptions then no work needs to be done here.",
