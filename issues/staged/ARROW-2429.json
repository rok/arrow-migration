Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen creating an Arrow table from a Pandas DataFrame, the table schema contains a field of type `timestamp[ns]`.\r\n\r\nWhen serialising that table to a parquet file and then immediately reading it back, the schema of the table read instead contains a field with type `timestamp[us]`.\r\n\r\nMinimal example:\r\n\u00a0\r\n```python\n\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n# create DataFrame with a datetime column\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'created': ['2018-04-04T10:14:14Z']})\r\ndf['created'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created'])\r\n\r\n# create Arrow table from DataFrame\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df, preserve_index=False)\r\n\r\n# write the table as a parquet file, then read it back again\r\npq.write_table(table, 'foo.parquet')\r\ntable2 = pq.read_table('foo.parquet')\r\n\r\nprint(table.schema[0])  # pyarrow.Field<created: timestamp[ns]> (nanosecond units)\r\nprint(table2.schema[0]) # pyarrow.Field<created: timestamp[us]> (microsecond units)\r\n```",

The only option is the one described above by `[~joshuastorck]`."
