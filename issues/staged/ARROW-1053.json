        "title": "[Python] Memory leak with RecordBatchFileReader",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1053](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1053). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile working on SPARK-13534 and running repeated calls to `toPandas`, memory usage continues to climb and I isolated to the Python side.  The following code reproduces the issue, which looks like a memory leak.  Commenting out the block with the `RecordBatchFileReader` while leaving the writer, memory usage is stable, so I believe the issue is with the reader.\n\n```\nimport pyarrow as pa\nimport numpy as np\nimport memory_profiler\nimport gc\nimport io\n\n\ndef leak():\n    data = [pa.array(np.concatenate([np.random.randn(100000)] * 10))]\n    table = pa.Table.from_arrays(data, ['foo'])\n    while True:\n        print('calling to_pandas')\n        print('memory_usage: {0}'.format(memory_profiler.memory_usage()))\n        df = table.to_pandas()\n\n        batch = pa.RecordBatch.from_pandas(df)\n\n        sink = io.BytesIO()\n        writer = pa.RecordBatchFileWriter(sink, batch.schema)\n        writer.write_batch(batch)\n        writer.close()\n\n        reader = pa.open_file(pa.BufferReader(sink.getvalue()))\n        reader.read_all()\n\n        gc.collect()\n\nleak()\n```\n\nSome of the output from the code above:\n```\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [67.0546875]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [143.95703125]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [151.58984375]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [174.453125]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [189.84765625]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [212.7109375]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [228.046875]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [243.109375]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [258.4375]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [273.83203125]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [288.90234375]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [304.23046875]\ncalling to_pandas\nmemory_usage: [319.625]\n```",
