Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nalso change there builders to not inherit from ListBuilder.  These should be first class types.  I think the consensus is to have them inherit from PrimitiveArray but I think I this might be awkward, and having them inherit directly from Array might be better. `[~wesmckinn]` thoughts?",
