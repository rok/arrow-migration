Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis currently relies on a pool of workers and endpoints; ideally we would be able to share a worker or even better multiplex multiple calls over a single endpoint (this would require wire protocol changes, however!). Care should be taken not to hurt performance if we do enable a multithreaded worker (which would be necessary, unless we switch to a model where all threads send work to a single worker thread).",
