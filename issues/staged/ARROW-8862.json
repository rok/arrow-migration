        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8862](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8862). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`NumericBuilder`\u00a0uses the\u00a0`pool`\u00a0(`MemoryPool*`) parameter to initialise the\u00a0`ArrayBuilder`\u00a0base class, but does not use it to initialise its own internal builder,\u00a0`data_builder_`\u00a0(`TypedBufferBuilder`). For comparison\u00a0`ArrayBuilder`\u00a0uses the\u00a0`pool`\u00a0to initialise its own\u00a0`null_bitmap_builder_`\u00a0member (also a\u00a0`TypedBufferBuilder`).\r\n\r\nFound in version 0.15.0, present in current head.\r\n\r\nThis effect was observed when trying to switch to a custom\u00a0`MemoryPool`\u00a0for performance reasons. A hook was used to detect any use of the\u00a0`MemoryPool`\u00a0proved by\u00a0`default_memory_pool()`.",
