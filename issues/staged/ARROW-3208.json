Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a partitioned dataset with the following code:\n   \n   ```python\n   \n   import numpy as np\n   \n   import pandas as pd\n   \n   import pyarrow as pa\n   \n   import pyarrow.parquet as pq\n   \n   df = pd.DataFrame({ 'one': [-1, 10, 2.5, 100, 1000, 1, 29.2], 'two': [-1, 10, 2, 100, 1000, 1, 11], 'three': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] })\n   \n   table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\n   \n   pq.write_to_dataset(table, root_path='/home/yingw787/misc/example_dataset', partition_cols=['one', 'two'])\n   \n   ```\n1. Create a Parquet file from a PyArrow Table created from the partitioned Parquet dataset:\n   \n   ```python\n   \n   import pyarrow.parquet as pq\n   \n   table = pq.ParquetDataset('/path/to/dataset').read()\n   \n   pq.write_table(table, '/path/to/example.parquet')\n   \n   ```\n   \n   EXPECTED:\n    \\* Successful write\n   \n   GOT:\n    \\* Segmentation fault\n   \n   Issue reference on GitHub mirror:\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2511",
