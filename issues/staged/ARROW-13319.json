Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNullArray::SetData sets null_bitmap_data_ to NULLPTR which IsNull and IsValid interpret as all values are not null. However, null_count() and length() will return the same value which makes it seem like IsNull() and IsValid() should return true and false respectively.",
