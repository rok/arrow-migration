Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in Avro converter, some attributes are used when creating vectors such as \u201cname\u201d, \u201csize\u201d etc, others are discarded.\r\n\r\nFor named type like Record, Enum and Fixed, they may have attributes like \u201cdoc\u201d \u201caliased\u201d which should keep in metadata for potential further use.\r\n\r\nBesides, properties are also not converted properly in some cases.",
