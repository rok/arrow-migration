        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8998](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8998). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince in the relatively near future, one will be able to do non-trivial analytical operations and query processing natively on Arrow data structures through pyarrow, it does not make sense to require users to always install NumPy when they install pyarrow. I propose to split the NumPy-depending parts of libarrow_python into a libarrow_numpy (which also must be bundled) and moving this part of the codebase into a separate Cython module.\r\n\r\nThis refactoring should be relatively painless though there may be a number of packaging details to chase up since this would introduce a new shared library to be installed in various packaging targets.
