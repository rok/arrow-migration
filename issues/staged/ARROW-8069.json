Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe just changed the default in Python to False for usability reasons. Since C++ has different usability considerations, we don't necessarily need to have the default be the same, but I'm curious if anyone has any opinions one way or the other. I would be weakly supportive of changing the default to false",
