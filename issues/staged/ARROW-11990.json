Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDiscussion on ML: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r7c369390dd0b99edb1e4529920e06e62a1f65802bcdfb34317436fac%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nWherever there is not a motivating performance reason for error\r\npropagation using `KernelContext::{SetStatus, status`} remove this in favor of the error pattern used in the rest of the library: returning a Status or (preferably) Result. This will avoid the added cognitive overhead and boilerplate code of interfacing between the different strategies.\r\n\r\nFor example, refactor KernelInit from `unique_ptr<KernelState>(KernelContext*, KernelInitArgs)` to `Result<unique_ptr<KernelState>>(ExecContext*, KernelInitiArgs)`",
