Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow supports wide range of hardware(x86,arm,ppc?) + os(linux,windows,macos,others?) + compiler(gcc,clang,msvc,others?). Managing platform dependent code is non-trivial. This Jira aims to refine(or mess up) defining SIMD feature macros.\r\nSimd feature definitions are scattered in source codes now. Better to define them into one place for easy management, possibly in cmake.",
