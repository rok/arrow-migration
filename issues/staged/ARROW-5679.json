Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe probably need to maintain Python 3.5 on Linux and macOS for the time being, but we may want to drop it for Windows since conda-forge isn't supporting Python 3.5 anymore, so maintaining wheels for Python 3.5 will come with extra cost",

We figured if someone needs the Py3.5/Windows combination that they would be motivated enough to help fix the problem we ran into. The wheels have been prone to maintenance issues as the work is essentially unfunded, despite the wheels being heavily depended on by well-heeled corporations"
