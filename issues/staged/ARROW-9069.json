Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe R bindings translate data to/from Scalars by using the Array methods already implemented: to go from R object to a Scalar, it creates a length-1 Array and then slices out the 0th element with GetScalar(); to go from Scalar to R object, it calls MakeArrayFromScalar and then the as.vector method on that Array (in R, there is no scalar type anyway, only length-1 vectors). \r\n\r\nThis generally works fine but if I get a Struct scalar (as the minmax compute function returns), I can't do anything with it because MakeArrayFromScalar doesn't work with structs.",
