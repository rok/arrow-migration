Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGcsFileSystem is using files ending with `/` as directory markers.  As described in ARROW-14924 this does not work when one wants to avoid creating a directory named `foo` (or `foo/`) if a file named `foo` already exists.\r\n",
