        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9272](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9272). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe original motivation for this patch was to reuse the same conversions path for both the scalars and arrays. \r\n\r\nIn my recent patch the scalars are converted from a single element list to a single element array then copied out from it.\r\n\r\nOn the long term we should convert them directly, perhaps with a more generic converter API, until that this patch aims to reduce code complexity without introducing any regressions.",
