        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8201](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8201). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFileFragment can be made more directly useful by adding convenience methods.\r\n\r\nFor example, a FileFragment could allow underlying file/buffer to be opened directly:\r\n```Java\n\r\n    def open(self):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Open a NativeFile of the buffer or file viewed by this fragment.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        cdef:\r\n            CFileSystem* c_filesystem\r\n            shared_ptr[CRandomAccessFile] opened\r\n            NativeFile out = NativeFile()\r\n\r\n        buf = self.buffer\r\n        if buf is not None:\r\n            return pa.io.BufferReader(buf)\r\n\r\n        with nogil:\r\n            c_filesystem = self.file_fragment.source().filesystem()\r\n            opened = GetResultValue(c_filesystem.OpenInputFile(\r\n                self.file_fragment.source().path()))\r\n\r\n        out.set_random_access_file(opened)\r\n        out.is_readable = True\r\n        return out\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a ParquetFileFragment's metadata could be introspectable:\r\n```Java\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def metadata(self):\r\n        from pyarrow._parquet import ParquetReader\r\n        reader = ParquetReader()\r\n        reader.open(self.open())\r\n        return reader.metadata\r\n```",
