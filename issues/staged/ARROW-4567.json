Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA common approach to performing operations on both scalar and array values is to treat a Scalar as an array of length 1. For example, we cannot currently use our Cast kernels to cast a Scalar. It would be senseless to create separate kernel implementations specialized for a single value, and much easier to promote a scalar to an Array, execute the kernel, then unbox the result back into a Scalar",
