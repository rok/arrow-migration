Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-1775 introduces the ability to abort objects in the Plasma store. When a client disconnects, the store iterates through all of the objects and either removes the client from the list of object users or aborts the object, depending on whether the object was sealed or not.\r\n\r\nBefore aborting the object, the store does not first check whether the client was the one who created the object. Right now, if a different client created the object, the store will crash when aborting it.",
