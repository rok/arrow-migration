Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer mailing list discussion, it may be better to not return the metadata always as a dict and instead wrap the KeyValueMetadata methods. We can make `__getitem__` lookup a key in it of course",

This is also a relatively \"advanced\" part of the project (which is already fairly developer-centric more so than user-centric), and so usability considerations should be balanced with featurefulness. If the KeyValueMetadata wrapper implemented the essential dict API, in particular\r\n\r\n- `__getitem__`\n- `keys`\n- `values`\n- `items`\n  \n  then there wouldn't be a lot of different (except the surprise \"what is this object\" the first time you see it)"
