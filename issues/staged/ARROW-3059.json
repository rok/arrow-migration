Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have some test helpers that live in the `arrow::test` namespace, some in `arrow` (or topic subnamespaces such as `arrow::io`). I see no reason for the discrepancy.\r\n\r\nI propose the simple solution of removing the `arrow::test` namespace altogether. If not desirable, then we should make sure we put all helpers in that namespace.",
