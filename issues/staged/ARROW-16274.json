        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16274](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16274). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Substrait consumer should be aware of which features the consumer was built with and gracefully reject plans that request unsupported features.\r\n\r\nFor example, Substrait plans could specify the parquet format and Arrow can be built without parquet support.  In that case the consumer should still compile but reject all parquet plans.\r\n\r\nToday we simply force all features that Substrait could possibly require to be turned on.",
