Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs follow up to ARROW-3246, we should support direct read/write of the other Parquet primitive types. Currently only BYTE_ARRAY is implemented as it provides the most performance benefit.",

To correctly round-trip date columns in the cycle Parquet -> Arrow -> pandas -> Arrow -> Parquet you need to use object columns in pandas with datetime.date objects. These can be quite repetitive and thus using dictionary encoding helps a lot here. Otherwise I would see the same use case for float columns but that isn't something I haven't yet used, mostly due to pandas not really working well with float categories."
