Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI ran cmake-format 0.5.1 locally and experienced non-deterministic changes that break the build such as\r\n\r\n```diff\n\r\ndiff --git a/cpp/cmake_modules/BuildUtils.cmake b/cpp/cmake_modules/BuildUtils.cmake\r\nindex 45cff6e9c..c80f21f34 100644\r\n--- a/cpp/cmake_modules/BuildUtils.cmake\r\n+++ b/cpp/cmake_modules/BuildUtils.cmake\r\n@@ -179,7 +179,7 @@ function(ADD_ARROW_LIB LIB_NAME)\r\n   else()\r\n# Otherwise, generate a single \"objlib\" from all C++ modules and link\r\n# that \"objlib\" into each library kind, to avoid compiling twice\r\n-    add_library(${LIB_NAME}_objlib OBJECT ${ARG_SOURCES})\r\n+    add_library(${LIB_NAME}_objlib ${ARG_SOURCES} OBJECT)\r\n# Necessary to make static linking into other shared libraries work properly\r\n     set_property(TARGET ${LIB_NAME}_objlib PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE 1)\r\n     if(ARG_DEPENDENCIES)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also found that some uses of `UNKNOWN IMPORTED` were rewritten as `IMPORTED UNKNOWN`. I have run cmake-format a few more times and haven't observed this again but wanted to report it in case anyone else encounters",
