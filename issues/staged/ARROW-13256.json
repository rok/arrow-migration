        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13256](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13256). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith the attached Dockerfile as a small self contained repro case, `ld`\u00a0produces the following error at link time:\r\n\r\n`/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libarrow.so.400.1.0: undefined reference to `bool std::operator==<arrow::Array>(std::shared_ptr<arrow::Array> const&, decltype(nullptr))`\r\n\r\nIn contrast, linking works fine with the Gold linker (uncomment\u00a0`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-fuse-ld=gold\"`), compiling with\u00a0`g++` instead of `clang++`, using -`DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`, or linking statically.\r\n\r\nNot sure whether it's an issue with Arrow or clang.",
