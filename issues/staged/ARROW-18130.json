Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn this page\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/timestamps.html\r\n\r\nThere is a code \r\npdf = pd.DataFrame({'naive': [datetime(2019, 1, 1, 0)],\r\n                    'aware': [Timestamp(year=2019, month=1, day=1,\r\n                              nanosecond=500, tz=timezone(timedelta(hours=-8)))]})\r\n\r\nwhich definitely creates a timestamps of 2019-01-01, but one line after it goes the  output:\r\n\r\npdf\r\n       naive                               aware\r\n       0 2018-10-01 2018-10-01 00:00:00.000000500-08:00\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it can be 2018-10-01?    This is definitely wrong. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
