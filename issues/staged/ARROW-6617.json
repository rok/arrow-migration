There are no \"epoch\" and \"debian-revision\". We always use \"1\" for \"debian-revision\".)\r\n\r\nIf we use smaller version for non production version, people who install non production version (0.15.0~dev20190918) can upgrade to production version (0.15.0).\r\n\r\nrpm uses \"0.15.0-0.dev20190918\" for non production. rpm uses \"0.15.0-1\" for production\". \"0.15.0-1\" is larger than \"0.15.0-0....\".\r\n\"0.15.0-0.dev20190918\" has \"Version\" and \"Release\". \"0.15.0\" is \"Version\". \"0.dev20190918\" is \"Release\". \"-\" is separator.\r\n\r\nSee also Fedora's Versioning Guidelines especially \"Prelease versions\": https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Versioning/#_prerelease_versions"
