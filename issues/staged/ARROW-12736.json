Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFieldPath::Get() uses RecordBatch::column_data which returns a vector<shared_ptr<>> by _value_ instead of by _reference_ - so with wide schemas, we end up copying and then destroying a lot of shared_ptrs. When done in a tight loop - as with dataset projection - this is a major performance pessimization.",
