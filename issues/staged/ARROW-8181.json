Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFlight currently do not make the gRPC trailer available when a FlightRuntimeException is called. This precludes using the richer error model discussed in [1][2]. The metadata in the gRPC trailer should be exposed in a protocol agnostic way. \r\n\r\nThis task is to expose error metadata without exposing transport implementation specifics.\r\n\r\n[1] https://grpc.io/docs/guides/error/#richer-error-model\r\n[2] https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model",
