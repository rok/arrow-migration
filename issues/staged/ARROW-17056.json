Substrait is just a spec so bumping to newer versions isn't likely to be needed for security reasons.  Plus, Substrait uses protobuf and aims to generally be backwards compatible so a newer producer should be fine even if we are targetting an older version as consumer.  Substrait is also iterating rapidly and will tend to have a new version / week for a while.  For the time being we should probably only bump Substrait when we need some kind of new feature for our own implementation."
