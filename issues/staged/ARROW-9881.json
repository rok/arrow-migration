        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9881](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9881). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor now, the only way to encode column with dict-encoding is to set\u00a0`auto_dict_encode = True` at\u00a0`arrow::csv``::``ConvertOptions`\r\n\r\nHowever, users should have the ability to specify column type as dict explicitly via\u00a0`column_types` parameter. (Currently it is raising an exception that dict type is not supported)",
