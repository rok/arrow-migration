        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4720](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4720). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we are requiring MinGW tests to pass on AppVeyor. Almost nobody will use MinGW builds if regular MSVC builds work fine. So it should be on the onus of the few people caring about MinGW to ensure that the build chain works on those platforms.\r\n\r\nExample here, apparently the uriparser library doesn't build on MinGW:\r\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/pitrou/arrow/build/job/t64xwyj2axhl1jgr\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency to inflate the number of different configurations in our CI matrices. Not only it makes builds longer and adds delays (see how long you have to wait before you get a CI result on AppVeyor), but it's of dubious utility. I'm not sure it serves the project's general interest.\r\n\r\nRant off ;)",
