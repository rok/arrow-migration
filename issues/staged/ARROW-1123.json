        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1123](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1123). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile one of the advertised point of Arrow Java is that it comes with an efficient allocator that is based on jemalloc, we only provide jemalloc as an alternative allocator in C++. I would propose to switch to it as the default allocator on all platforms jemalloc is available (i.e. MacOS and Linux) as it provides the following benefits:\n\n \\* in-place resizing while ensuring 64byte alignment, for allocations >4kb this won't touch the data but rather only changes some pointers in kernel internal structs pointing to the respecitive memory pages.\n \\* better allocation algorithm, see https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/scalable-memory-allocation-using-jemalloc/480222803919/ that should lead to less fragmentation and support fast multithreaded allocations\n\nEspecially for the builders, simply changing the allocator shows speedups between 2x and 10x. In the optimal case, this puts builders nearly on the same level as if one would have pre-allocated the final size.\n \nThis change should also include a blog post that outlines the benefits.",
