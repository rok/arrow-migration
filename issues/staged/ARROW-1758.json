        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1758](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1758). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs pointed out in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1272#issuecomment-340738439, we don't really need this option, it can already be done with pickle.dumps as the custom serializer and pickle.loads as the deserializer.\r\n\r\nThis has the additional benefit that it will be very clear to the user which pickler will be used and the user can use a custom pickler easily.",
