        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5270](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5270). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRunning Valgrind on Travis-CI was disabled in ARROW-4611 (apparently because of issues within the re2 library).\r\n\r\nWe should reenable it at some point in order to exercise the reliability of our C++ code.\r\n(and/or have a build with another piece of instrumentation enabled such as ASAN)",

There are two possible reasons for this. ==20276== 1. Your program has a bug and erroneously jumped to a non-code ==20276== location. If you are running Memcheck and you just saw a ==20276== warning about a bad jump, it's probably your program's fault.\n   \n   2. the re2 issues\n   \n   I think these are already covered by the suppressions listed in the valgrind.supp but they aren't being recognized due to missing symbols in the stack.\u00a0\n   \n   When I ran this on my xenial setup without any conda setup, the stacks showed up correctly and got suppressed. so, I suspect this is an issue with conda binaries."

For that we would need to enable MSan which I don't think is practical.  But I agree we should catch a large class of errors with current sanitizers. "
