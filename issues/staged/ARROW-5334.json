Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThese intermediate classes used for template metaprogramming (in particular, `std::is_base_of`) have inconsistent names with the rest of data types. For clarity, I think we should add \"Type\" to these class names and others like them\r\n\r\nPlease do after ARROW-3144",
