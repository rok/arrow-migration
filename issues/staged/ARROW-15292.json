Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe V8 package uses binaries on those platforms: https://github.com/jeroen/V8/blob/16289554d548b9cdaba9cf0c71e35c7586d1a9d8/configure#L28-L35\r\n\r\nCould we do this too? One thing that will complicate this is that we don't build our binary + host it somewhere on each build / with nightlies. So we will need to either _only_ do this on release numbers, or do something in CI to host binaries in the style we do with nightlies (or move those nightly builds into apache/arrow and use those...)",
