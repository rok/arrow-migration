        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12584](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12584). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA team working on Arrow benchmarks encountered a problem where the mimalloc allocator was holding onto considerably more RAM than needed (at least 6GB and potentially more).\r\n\r\nMimalloc offers the `mi_collect` non-standard API which forces mimalloc to release unused pages to the OS.\u00a0 We could expose this to be called by benchmarking tools to get consistent results and reduce the amount of RAM needed.",
