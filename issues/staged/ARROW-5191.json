Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's sometimes convenient to be able to view a datasource's schema without reading the first record batch. This is a proposal to create a `pub fn schema(&self) -> Arc<Schema>` on the various readers that we support.\r\n\r\nI think this would also enable schema inference in datafusion",
