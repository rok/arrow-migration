Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are making enough non-forward-compatible format changes that we should increase the format version to V5 while continuing to accept V4 (because the changes we've made are backward compatible) and where relevant implementing a V4-compatibility mode that disables features where there are changes between 0.17.x and 1.x",
