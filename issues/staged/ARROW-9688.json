        "title": "[C++] Supporting Windows ARM64 builds",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9688). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was trying to build the Arrow library so I could use it to generate parquet files on Windows ARM64, but it currently fails to compile for a few reasons. I thought I'd enumerate them here, so someone more familiar with the project could spearhead it.\r\n\r\nIn SetupCxxFlags.cmake\r\n \\* the MSVC branch for ARROW_CPU_FLAG STREQUAL \"x86\" is taken even though I'm building ARM64, this may be a more fundamental error somewhere else that needs correction and maybe things would work better, but an inspection of other branches seemed to indicate that ARM64 is assumed to be missing from MSVC and the keywrod \"aarch64\" (not a term used in the Windows ecosystem) is prevalent in the cmake files. So the first thing I did was I stubbed it out and set SSE42, AVX and AVX512 to be not present\r\n \\* In bit_util.h I provided implementations for popcount32, popcount64 that were not neon accelerated, although neon_cnt is provided by msvc (for n64)\r\n \\* Removed nmintrin.h since that is x64/x64 specific. Note,\u00a0_BitScanReverse and\u00a0_BitScanForward are Microsoft specific and support on ARM64.\r\n \\* cpu_info.cc needed tweaks for cpuid stuff, I just returned false and didn't really care too much about any upstream effects.\u00a0flag_mappings and num_flags ought be defined in the not WIN32 ifdef, since they're not actually used.\r\n\r\nAfter these changes I was able to remove the vcpkg restriction that artificially failed the library from compiling on arm64 and I was able to successfully compile for both arm64-windows-static and arm64-windows.",

Some places need tweaking.\r\n- [Line26](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L26), CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR is used to determine build host architecture(from cmake doc, its value is %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% on windows). Add the actual value to match list should correct ARROW_CPU_FLAG to \"armv8\".\n- [Line75-78](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L75-L78) assumes compiler is gcc/clang, should add MSVC specific options, see line42\n- Similar changes to [Line366~389](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L366-L389)."

For my own purposes I was able to compile something, but it's not worthy of upstreaming beyond the stream of consciousness notes I left in the issue."
