Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile looking at the pandas metadata, I noticed that the `pandas_version` field now is None. I suppose this is due to the recent refactoring of the pandas api compat (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3893). PR coming.",
