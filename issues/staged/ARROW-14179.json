Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe C Data Interface implementation for\u00a0UnionArray includes a validity buffer as the first buffer. However, union arrays should have no validity buffer according to the specification ([Arrow Columnar Format \u2014 Apache Arrow v5.0.0](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#buffer-listing-for-each-layout))\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
