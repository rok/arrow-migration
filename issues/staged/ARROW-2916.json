Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I writes a 1MB tensor into plasma, it takes about 2ms. 50% of time is spent sealing the object. Can we add a flag to the Seal API to disable to hashing when needed?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Status PlasmaClient::Seal(const ObjectID& object_id, bool hash_flag)\r\n ```\r\n \u00a0\r\n\r\ncc `[~pcmoritz]`",
