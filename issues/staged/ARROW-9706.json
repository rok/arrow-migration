        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9706](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9706). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMultiple test cases (e.g. `testSetLastSetUsage`) in `TestLargeListVector` fail on a big-endian platform.\r\n\r\nThis is because these test cases read offset as integer while the width of the offset is 8-byte. This means that only the first 4-byte are read. It works only for a little-endian platform.",
