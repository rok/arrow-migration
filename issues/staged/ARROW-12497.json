Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10056#discussion_r616985185\r\n\r\nCurrently, the R implementation allows for array expressions to be built which are later evaluated within a single call to Filter rather than in multiple operations.\u00a0 This functionality should be moved to the C++ level so it's dealt with at a lower level.",
