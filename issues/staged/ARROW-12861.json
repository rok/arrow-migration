On the other hand, integral zero results in **sign(0) = 0**. Is this behavior reasonable?\r\n\r\nThis approach will result in different behavior for floating-point and integral operands.\r\n1. Floating-point **sign(X) =**\n**-1 if X <= -0.0**\r\n**1 if X >= 0.0**\r\n1. Integral **sign(X) =**\n**-1 if X < 0**\r\n**0 if X = 0**\r\n**1 if X > 0**"

(b) There is little practical use in knowing the sign of a floating point zero value; this sign kernel will be more consistent and more useful in more ways if it always returns sign zero for value zero."

We may want a FunctionOption for that--but we can also defer that until someone reports it, which as Ian suggests, may never happen."
