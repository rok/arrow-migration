Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe pydata-sphinx-theme tends to create large trees in the left-side navigation (and thus large generated large html sizes) because sphinx adds all generated docstring pages (from autosummary usage) to the global \"toctrees\". A small package (https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-remove-toctrees/) was created to help with this.\r\n\r\nSee https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/configuring.html#selectively-remove-pages-from-your-sidebar",

See also https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-remove-toctrees/issues/1#issuecomment-950927077\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with this change we can remove the if/else in the template here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/be665ef948cb2c6706c60053c5db918e948713e8/docs/source/_templates/docs-sidebar.html#L13-L17 (and have it a single `generate_nav_html` call instead)."
