Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt should not be possible for these functions to fail. Internal failures indicate a problem with the implementation rather than the input data, and any such problems should be caught by a debug assertion in the test suite",

What I think needs to be done under this ticket is:\n\n- Keep the current API (compare.h) but update the docs that the functions are deprecated since 0.8\n- Create a new set of functions returning bool values\n- Create a new ticket tagged with version 1.0 to remove the deprecated functions for 1.0 release\n \nIs this correct?\n"
