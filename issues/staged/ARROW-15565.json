        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15565](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15565). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDoing a roundtrip from Pandas with IntervalIndex results in an object-dtype index, and not a proper Intervalndex - that means the interval dtype is not preserved on a roundtrip, while this would be the case if it was a normal column instead of the index.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame(index=pd.interval_range(start=0, end=3))\r\n>>> table = pa.table(df)\r\n>>> table.to_pandas().index\r\nIndex([{'left': 0, 'right': 1}, {'left': 1, 'right': 2},\r\n       {'left': 2, 'right': 3}],\r\n      dtype='object')\r\n>>> df.index\r\nIntervalIndex([(0, 1], (1, 2], (2, 3]], dtype='interval[int64, right]')\r\n>>> \r\n```",
