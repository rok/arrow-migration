Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt appears that ASAN wants the symbolizer to be named `llvm-symbolizer` and not `llvm-symbolizer-12` which is what Ubuntu puts on the path.\u00a0 We can fix this by giving the path to /usr/lib/llvm-12/bin/llvm-symbolizer.",
