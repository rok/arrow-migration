Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen a Python developer lands on Arrow docs, it easily gets confused because the page takes for granted you know what's arrow, what's its purpose and why you should use it.\r\n\r\nMost of the documentation seems to be written like you are a developer that already knows arrow and needs to use it in 3-4 different languages. While in reality it's more common the opposite, you land on the docs because you are approaching arrow for the first time and you are probably only going to ever use the bindings for your daily job language.",
