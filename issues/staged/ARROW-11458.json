However, pyarrow does not specify an upper bound for the numpy version [1].\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython 3.7.9 (default, Oct 30 2020, 13:50:59)\r\n[GCC 10.2.0] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> np.__version__\r\n\r\n'1.20.0'\r\n\r\n>>> pa.__version__\r\n'2.0.0'\r\n>>> pa.array(np.arange(10))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 292, in pyarrow.lib.array\r\n File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 79, in pyarrow.lib._ndarray_to_array\r\n File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 67, in pyarrow.lib._ndarray_to_type\r\n File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 107, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: Did not pass numpy.dtype object\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[1]\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/478286658055bb91737394c2065b92a7e92fb0c1/python/setup.py#L572\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
