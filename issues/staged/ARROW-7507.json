Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n**Problem Description**\r\n\r\nCurrently, `byteorder` crate changes is not incorporated in both `parquet-format` and `parquet` crates. Both should have consistently updated to the thrift 0.13 in reverse order(first parquet-format then parquet) to update the dependencies which are using older versions.\r\n\r\nThis makes clashing versions from other crates that are following the upstream.",
