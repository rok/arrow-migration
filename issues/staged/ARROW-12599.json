And this might be a bug in sphinx since I was using sphinx 3.4.3 locally, and the online ones are built with the latest 3.5.4. Will test locally with the latest version as well to verify."

Static file servers sometimes have options for case sensitivity.\r\n\r\nI don't think that's the issue, as it's the actual HTML generated by sphinx that doesn't include the proper link.\r\n\r\nNow, I can't reproduce this, also not locally using sphinx 3.5.4.  \r\n`[~kszucs]` do you know what environment you used to build the docs? Eg the Python version?"
