        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13312](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13312). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn recently added `Bitmap::VisitWordAndWrite` method, translates the `visitor` lambda (that works on a `Word`) to a byte-visitor while handling the epilogue.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to incorrect results in the client code.\r\n\r\nex:\r\n```java\n\r\n// code placeholder\r\n// N readers, M writers \r\nint64_t bits_written = 0;\r\nauto visitor = [&](std::array<Word, N> in, std::array<Word, M>* out){\r\n ...\r\n bits_written += (sizeof(Word) * 8);\r\n}\n```\r\nAt the end of the Visit, bits_written would have an incorrect sum because in the prologue, it adds 64 to bits_written for each trailing byte, whereas it should've been 8.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPossible solution:\r\n\r\nNeeds to add ReadTrailingWord and WriteTrailingWord functionality to BitmapWordReader and BitmapWordWriter respectively and call visitor with the words in the epilogue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
