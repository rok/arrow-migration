        "title": "[MATLAB] Add MATLAB support for reading numeric types from Feather files",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2750](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2750). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd MATLAB support for reading numeric types (i.e. [u]int[x][y], float, double) from Feather files. This is the first in a series of future feature\u00a0submissions for Feather read/write support and other Arrow IPC integration with MATLAB.\r\n\r\nThe associated pull request creates a top-level \"matlab\" directory in the Apache Arrow project. It also introduces a MATLAB function \"featherread\", which takes a Feather filename as input and returns a MATLAB table. featherread maps Feather\u00a0datatypes to corresponding\u00a0MATLAB\u00a0datatypes.\r\n\r\nThis initial pull request does not support null values.\r\n\r\nfeatherread.m calls the Arrow C+\u00a0APIs\u00a0using MEX, MATLAB's\u00a0facility for calling C/C+ code.\r\n\r\nSee the README.md in the \"matlab\" directory for instructions on how to build the MEX interface. Currently, building on Windows\u00a0using CMake is not fully functional, but the MEX interface can be compiled manually using the MATLAB \"mex\" command.\r\n\r\nA MATLAB install is required to be present on your machine to build the MEX interface.\u00a0",
