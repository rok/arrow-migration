        "title": "[C++] Implement week kernel that accepts WeekOptions",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13561). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow has an `iso_week`\u00a0compute kernel that follows the\u00a0[ISO 8601 week date definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#First_week). Add another kernel (maybe named `week`) that\u00a0lets you specify options for how exactly to count weeks, like MySQL's week function:\u00a0[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_week](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html%23function_week&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1628103672101000&usg=AFQjCNHap0KtiiZ83G_PVRPz5T7z6y-lIQ).\r\n\r\n~~I think we can reuse the existing `DayOfWeekOptions` to specify the options, but we should change the description of the `one_based_numbering` argument to:~~\r\n> ~~Number from 1 if true and from 0 if false.~~\r\n~~removing the word \"days\" from it, so it can control whether days _or_ weeks are numbered starting from 0 or 1 depending on where it's used.~~",
