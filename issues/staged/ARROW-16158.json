        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16158](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16158). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we introduced substrait we reused the cmake + feature `ARROW_ENGINE` to mean compute+a few other things as well as the substrait consumer functionality. In general, right now, we don't yet need (or want) to build substrait in our packages (e.g. the R package) since many places don't yet take advantage of it. But the naming of the cmake or feature is now confusing: it effectively is only substrait if you separately enable compute, etc. but it makes it sound like the query engine we have been building since 6.0.0 is disabled.\r\n\r\nWe should rename `ARROW_ENGINE` to `ARROW_SUBSTRAIT` now and then we can add an `ARROW_ENGINE` later if we need to encompass a larger set of engine functionality (e.g. compute+spillover+scheduler+memory limits) if that's needed.",

We had originally named it ARROW_ENGINE thinking that more components would move into here over time.  However, those components haven't moved yet.  So currently, once you take away the Substrait components there is not much left.  I think the idea is to rename to ARROW_SUBSTRAIT and then later introduce ARROW_ENGINE once we have more engine components."
