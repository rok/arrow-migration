        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5510](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5510). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe initial Feather file format is\u00a0a minimal subset of\u00a0the Arrow IPC format. It has a number of limitations (see\u00a0<https://wesmckinney.com/blog/feather-arrow-future/>).\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe want to retain \"feather\" as the name of the on-disk representation of Arrow memory, so in order to support everything that Arrow supports, we need a \"feather 2.0\" format.\r\n\r\nIIUC, defining the file format is \"done\" (dump the memory to disk). Remaining issues include upgrading \"feather\" readers and writers in all languages to support both feather 1.0 and feather 2.0. (e.g.\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5501)",
