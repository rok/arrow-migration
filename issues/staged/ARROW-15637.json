Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNeed an interface to evaluate the memory footprint, execution time and health of the UDFs and return a meaningful status ex: `Status::HighMemoryUsageException()`, `Status::TimeLimitException()`\r\n\r\nNote: This is also aligned with resource monitoring in the parallel execution space.\u00a0",

Most of the data science or data engineering applications in the Python space use Pandas or Numpy based data structures, so it won't be a serious problems, but it is nice to keep an eye on possible situations where there are exceptions to these cases.\u00a0"
