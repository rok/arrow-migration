A simpler reprex:\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\ndf2 <- tibble::tibble(x = list(NULL, 1, 2))\r\nas_arrow_table(df2)\r\n# Error: Cannot infer type from vector\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, it looks like specifically, it's the call to `Table__from_dots()` on a df containing a list column in which the first element is NULL."

It's due to how we infer types of lists - will get a PR up to fix this soon.  A temporary workaround would be to reorder the list so that the first element is never NULL, though I can see that this is not ideal."
