Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSelection vectors constructed from filters do not need to be subjected to boundschecking and other such safety checks as are present with a usual invocation of `take`. So based on the type width of a selection vector (uint16?) we should implement highly streamlined take implementations that additionally take into consideration that selection vectors are monotonic by construction",
