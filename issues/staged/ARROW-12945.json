        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12945](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12945). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInMemoryDataset could inherit FragmentDataset. Actually it'd be beneficial if all datasets could have a vector of their fragments; this would allow subtree pruning to be used on any dataset when performing predicate pushdown.\r\n\r\nSee also ARROW-8065 for which an unmet goal was to make Dataset a concrete class which contained fragments (essentially FragmentDataset), and have subclasses simply add guarantees on those fragments (FileSystemDataset contains only FIleFragments).\r\n\r\nSee also ARROW-12891 (add support for subtree pruning to FragmentDataset)\r\n\r\nNB: This will require promotion of FragmentDataset to a public class or demotion of InMemoryDataset to an internal class (with public factories)",
