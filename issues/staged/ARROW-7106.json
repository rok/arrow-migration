Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFlight performance test (org.apache.arrow.flight.perf.TestPerf) is an important tool for tracking the current throughput of IPC. In this issue, we improve it in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. We fix the problem that the test hangs endlessly after all runs have been finished. This is because the thread pool is not released.\r\n\r\n2. We add a summary to the output report, so that we can easily evaluate the overall results for all runs. \r\n",
