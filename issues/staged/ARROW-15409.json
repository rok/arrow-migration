        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15409](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15409). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was working on write dataset testing in the C++ API today and ran into a number of things that were not very intuitive.  All of these are abstracted away / hidden by the python / R interface so this really only applies to anyone using the C++ API directly.\r\n\r\n \\* If no partitioning is specified the write will segfault.  Instead it should us a default (no-op) partitioning.\r\n \\* The min_rows_per_group option should probably default to something higher than 0\r\n \\* It's not clear how to specify the format (you do it by creating a format, then setting the file write options, which sets the format privately)\r\n \\* There is no default for basename_template\r\n \\* There is no default for filesystem (should be local filesystem)",
