        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7223](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7223). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-3191, consumers of Arrow Java with a JDK 9 and above are required to set the JVM property \"io.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true\" at startup, each time Arrow code is run, as documented at https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/java#java-properties. Not doing this will result in the error \"java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: sun.misc.Unsafe or java.nio.DirectByteBuffer.(long, int) not available\", making Arrow unusable out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\nThis proposes to automatically set the property if not already set in the following steps:\r\n\r\n1) check to see if the property io.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible has been set\r\n2) if not set, automatically set to \"true\"\r\n3) else if set to \"false\", catch the Netty error and prepend the error message with the suggested setting of \"true\"",

At the very least, it would be good to have a record of this info for consumers of Arrow Java that also might encounter the issue."
