Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nEdit: this ticket was originally just about adding the R package docs, but it seems that the JS and Java docs aren't getting built as part of the release process anymore, so that needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOriginal description:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5452\u00a0added the R pkgdown site config. Adding the wiring into the apidocs build scripts was deferred because there was some discussion about\u00a0which workflow was supported and which was deprecated.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nUwe says: \"Have a look at <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/Dockerfile> and <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/docker_build_sphinx.sh> Add that and a docs-r entry in the main `docker-compose.yml` should be sufficient to get it running in the docker setup. But actually I would rather like to see that we also add the R build to the above linked files.\"",
