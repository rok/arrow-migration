Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRelated to ARROW-5248, but specifically for the stdlib `datetime.timezone.utc`, I think it would be nice to \"recognize\" this as UTC. Currently it is converted to \"+00:00\", while for pytz this is not the case:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\r\nimport pytz\r\n\r\nprint(pa.array([datetime.now(timezone.utc)]).type)\r\nprint(pa.array([datetime.now(pytz.utc)]).type)\r\n```\r\n\r\ngives\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\ntimestamp[us, tz=+00:00]\r\ntimestamp[us, tz=UTC]\r\n```",
