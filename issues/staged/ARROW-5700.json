Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI open an output stream to write a parquet file. Here is the code:\r\n```java\n\r\nstd::shared_ptr<arrow::io::OutputStream> outStream;\r\narrow::Status err;\r\n\r\nerr = arrow::io::FileOutputStream::Open(filePath.toStdString(), false, &outStream);\r\nif (err.code() != arrow::StatusCode::OK) {\r\n    std::cout << err.message() << std::endl;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere is the error message I got:\r\n```java\n\r\nFailed to open local file: <path_to_parquet_file> , error: Bad file descriptor\"\r\n```\r\nI've got this error only when running on Windows version\u00a010.0.10586.1106 (th2_release.170904-1742).\r\n\r\nAny idea?",
