        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10923](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10923). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter a parquet file was copied to an s3-bucket and s3-key, pyarrow does not read it from s3.  Desired behavior is that an s3-object for parquet should be self-contained, it should not depend on or track any substantial metadata about the storage engine or file system location it was saved to in such a way that it prevents relocating the object.  To try to replicate the problem, save any parquet file on a linux file system (ext4) and then use the aws-cli to copy that file to any s3-object and then try to use geopandas.read_parquet to load that s3-object.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile \"/opt/conda/envs/project/lib/python3.7/site-packages/geopandas/io/arrow.py\", line 404, in _read_parquet\r\n table = parquet.read_table(path, columns=columns, \\*\\*kwargs)\r\n File \"/opt/conda/envs/project/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py\", line 1573, in read_table\r\n ignore_prefixes=ignore_prefixes,\r\n File \"/opt/conda/envs/project/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py\", line 1434, in __init__\r\n ignore_prefixes=ignore_prefixes)\r\n File \"/opt/conda/envs/project/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/dataset.py\", line 667, in dataset\r\n return _filesystem_dataset(source, \\*\\*kwargs)\r\n File \"/opt/conda/envs/project/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/dataset.py\", line 424, in _filesystem_dataset\r\n fs, paths_or_selector = _ensure_single_source(source, filesystem)\r\n File \"/opt/conda/envs/project/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/dataset.py\", line 391, in _ensure_single_source\r\n file_info = filesystem.get_file_info([path])[0]\r\n File \"pyarrow/_fs.pyx\", line 429, in pyarrow._fs.FileSystem.get_file_info\r\n File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 122, in pyarrow.lib.pyarrow_internal_check_status\r\n File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 99, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ poetry show pyarrow\r\nname         : pyarrow\r\nversion      : 1.0.1\r\ndescription  : Python library for Apache Arrow\r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - numpy >=1.14\r\n\r\n$ poetry show geopandas\r\nname         : geopandas\r\nversion      : 0.8.1\r\ndescription  : Geographic pandas extensions\r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - fiona \\*\r\n - pandas >=0.23.0\r\n - pyproj >=2.2.0\r\n - shapely \\*\r\n\r\n$ poetry show s3fs\r\nname         : s3fs\r\nversion      : 0.4.2\r\ndescription  : Convenient Filesystem interface over S3\r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - botocore >=1.12.91\r\n - fsspec >=0.6.0\r\n\r\n$ poetry show fsspec\r\nname         : fsspec\r\nversion      : 0.8.4\r\ndescription  : File-system specification\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
