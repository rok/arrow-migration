Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPretty much what the title says. Suppose I have a numpy array and its a numpy.int8 type. How do I convert it to a pyarrow.Datatype intuitively? I thought a Dictionary lookup table might work but perhaps there is some better way?\r\n\r\nWhy do I need this? I am trying to make pyarrow arrays with from_buffers(). The first parameter is essentially a pyarrow.Datatype. So that's why. I have validity_bitmaps as a buffer of uint8 and that's why I am using from_buffers() and not pyarrow.array().",
