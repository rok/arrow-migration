Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Ubuntu 18 nightly test is failing to compiler the Substrait consumer.  This is probably due to an older version of protoc.  Example: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/7830373122?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nWe should make sure we are using protobuf in a way that is compatible with older protoc.",
