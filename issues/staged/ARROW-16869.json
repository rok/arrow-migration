        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16869](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16869). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `homebrew-r-brew` nightly job has been failing since the ARROW_GCS flag was turned on in ARROW-14892. The failure is an undefined absl symbol\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location\r\nError: Error: package or namespace load failed for \u2018arrow\u2019 in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):\r\n unable to load shared object '/Users/runner/work/crossbow/crossbow/arrow/r/check/arrow.Rcheck/00LOCK-arrow/00new/arrow/libs/arrow.so':\r\n  dlopen(/Users/runner/work/crossbow/crossbow/arrow/r/check/arrow.Rcheck/00LOCK-arrow/00new/arrow/libs/arrow.so, 6): Symbol not found: __ZN4absl12lts_2021110210FormatTimeENS0_11string_viewENS0_4TimeENS0_8TimeZoneE\r\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/opt/apache-arrow/lib/libarrow.900.dylib\r\n  Expected in: flat namespace\r\n in /usr/local/opt/apache-arrow/lib/libarrow.900.dylib\r\n```\r\n\r\nI encountered the same error when working on R bindings for GCS in ARROW-16510. There are two issues:\r\n\r\n- The bundled abseil cmake build macro is incomplete, possibly as a result of a merge conflict\n- The homebrew formula should be updated to use the brew bottles for the google-cloud-cpp dependencies (there is no formula for it itself) rather than bundle everything",
