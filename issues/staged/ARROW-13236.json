Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13025 added a ToString which is now used in the Python repr. This adds the specified parameters nicely, but I would be useful to still include the name of the class as well:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [9]: pc.TrimOptions(\"a\")\r\nOut[9]: {characters=\"a\"}\r\n```",
