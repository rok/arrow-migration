        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3030](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3030). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile troublehsooting ARROW-2966 I updated my pandas dataframe with more type information. Specifically, I changed some mixed type columns to categorical instead of object. I assumed that the Table.from_pandas() would\u00a0inspect the pandas type information and respect that when converting it over to a table. It doesn't seem to.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I expected this code to work, but it throws the same ArrowTypeError as ARROW-2966.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport numpy as np\r\ndf=pd.DataFrame.from_dict({\"col\":[0,1,2,3,\"\"]},dtype=\"category\")\r\ntb = pa.Table.from_pandas(df, columns=[\"col\"])\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",
