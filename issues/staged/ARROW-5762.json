Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-1279 enabled integration tests for MapType between Java and C++, but JavaScript had to be disabled for the map case due to an error.  Once this is fixed, `generate_map_case` could be moved under `generate_nested_case` with the other nested types.",

We should absolutely update the JS Map implementation before the 1.0 release.\r\n"
