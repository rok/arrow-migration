        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11925](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11925). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWould you consider a PR to add a between method for `arrow_dplyr_query` objects? Even something implemented directly in R harnesses the arrow speed. Here is what I am thinking:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTypical usage of `between`:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\niris %>% filter(between(Petal.Length, 1, 1.1))\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0Here is a mocked up version of the method:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nbetween_mock <- function(x, left, right) {\r\nif (length(left) != 1) {\r\n rlang::abort(\"`left` must be length 1\")\r\n }\r\n if (length(right) != 1) {\r\n rlang::abort(\"`right` must be length 1\")\r\n }x >= left & x <= right\r\n}\n```\r\nI think because `dplyr` uses C++ to efficiently do this, `between` doesn't work out of the box:\r\n```java\n\r\nopen_dataset(\"nyc-taxi\", partitioning = \"year\") %>% \r\n filter(year == 2014) %>% \r\n select(year, fare_amount) %>% \r\n filter(between(fare_amount, 10, 11)) %>% \r\n collect() \r\n\r\nError: Filter expression not supported for Arrow Datasets: between(fare_amount, 10, 11)\r\nCall collect() first to pull data into R.\r\nIn addition: Warning message:\r\n between() called on numeric vector with S3 class \r\nBacktrace:\r\n x\r\n1. +-[ `%>%`(...) ]\r\n2. +-[ dplyr::collect(...) ]\r\n3. +-[ dplyr::filter(...) ]\r\n4. \\-arrow:::filter.arrow_dplyr_query(...)\n```\r\nBut even my simple implementation works fine:\r\n```java\n\r\nopen_dataset(\"nyc-taxi\", partitioning = \"year\") %>% \r\n filter(year == 2014) %>% \r\n select(year, fare_amount) %>% \r\n filter(between_mock(fare_amount, 10, 11)) %>% \r\n collect() \n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
