Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe machine detection script (`make_machine_json.sh`) currently looks like it will only work properly on macOS. Ideally it should work more or less correctly on all of them macOS, Linux and Windows (some values may remain undetected on some platforms).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis probably entails:\r\n - extend `archery benchmark` (see https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4827\u00a0and tentative implementation in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4077/files>)\u00a0rather than a standalone bash script\u00a0\r\n - using something like [psutil](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to grab useful machine information\r\n - calling `nvidia-smi` to query GPU characteristics (for example \"nvidia-smi -q -i 0 -x\")",

It might be worth writing this in python for future compat with without."

The existing shell\u00a0script was only because it was easy and quick.\r\n\r\nI am very very sorry for dropping the ball the past couple of months. My mom passed away and I have been a total wreck (and\u00a0moved back home from her house and\u00a0got a job) but I still want to contribute and hope you will accept me back now. You all rock very much!"
