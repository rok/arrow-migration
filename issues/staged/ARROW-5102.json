Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo tame C++ compile times, we should try to reduce the number of heavy dependencies in our .h files.\r\n\r\nTwo possible avenues come to mind:\r\n- avoid including `unordered_map` and friends\n- avoid including C++ stream libraries (such as `iostream`, `ios`, `sstream`...)\n  \n  Unfortunately we're currently including `sstream` in `status.h` for some template APIs. We may move those to a separate include file (e.g. `status-builder.h`).",
