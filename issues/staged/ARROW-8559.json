Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have the `BatchIterator` trait in DataFusion and the `RecordBatchReader` trait in the main arrow crate.\r\n\r\nThey differ in that `BatchIterator` is Send + Sync.\u00a0 They should both be in the Arrow crate and be named `BatchIterator` and `SendableBatchIterator`",

If we want to make sure that a type marks itself `Send` and/or `Sync`, it can do that. If an interface wants to accept only `Send` and/or `Sync` iterators, it could do `BatchIterator + Send + Sync`.\r\n\r\nBikeshed: There are no `std::iter::Iterator` trait implementation for either `BatchIterator` or `RecordBatchReader`. Thus, using the name `Iterator` seems a bit misleading."
