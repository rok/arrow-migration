Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-15961 found that the Parquet Arrow reader wasn't respecting the nullable aspect of fields, we need to ensure that if we reconstruct an array for a non-nullable field, that it has no validity bitmap. We need to also add tests for this case, they're implicitly tested in a few places, but we should explicitly test this for all supported types.",
