Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUsing an approach similar to ARROW-10989, migrate typed array API's to use slices where they can.\r\n\r\nThis impacts the API of:\r\n \\* GenericBinaryArray<>\r\n \\* GenericListArray<>\r\n \\* GenericStringArray<>\r\n\r\nThis also enables bounds checking in every value() function on each of the above arrays (as well as PrimitiveArray<> ).\r\n\r\nThe new PrimitiveArray.value() bounds check\u00a0 has a negative performance impact on various benchmarks that still use the .Value(...) function on PrimitiveArray.\u00a0 But that should be resolvable by using the PrimitiveArray.values() instead (whether within this PR or a future PR).",
