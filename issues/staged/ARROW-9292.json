Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we created the feature matrix, I preemptively populated the Rust column with supported features. We've subsequently been having trouble with integration tests.\r\n\r\nThis blocker is so that I can update the feature matrix before 1.0.0 release based on which tests are passing by then.\r\n\r\nCC `[~wesm]` `[~apitrou]`",
