Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowing the contributing guidelines for the first time I did not use the `-DARROW_DATASET=On` flag as it does not appear on the documentation guidelines.\r\n\r\nThere was a test failure when running tests because the dataset module was not found:\r\n```java\n\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyarrow._dataset' \n```\r\nMy expectation is that this test should have been skipped as it requires dataset.",
