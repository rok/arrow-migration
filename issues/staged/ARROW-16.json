One is setting the appropriate C++-11 options in CMAKE.  The other is removing a library not present on OS X.  Suggestions:\n1. Update cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.7) to cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)\n2. Remove all use of C++-11 command line options from CXX_COMMON_FLAGS as well as CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS\n3. Use set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11), a feature of cmake 3.1 and later to automatically set the complier's flags\n4. Do not link against rt found in utils on OS X.\n\nI'll be happy to build a pull request is the general approach is acceptable.\n"
