        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5101](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5101). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe're currently bundling static libraries in Windows conda packages. Unfortunately, it causes these to be quite large:\r\n```bash\n\r\n$ ls -la ./Library/lib\r\ntotal 507808\r\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 antoine antoine      4096 avril  3 10:28 .\r\ndrwxrwxr-x 5 antoine antoine      4096 avril  3 10:28 ..\r\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 antoine antoine   1507048 avril  1 20:58 arrow.lib\r\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 antoine antoine     76184 avril  1 20:59 arrow_python.lib\r\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 antoine antoine  61323846 avril  1 21:00 arrow_python_static.lib\r\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 antoine antoine 328090000 avril  1 21:02 arrow_static.lib\r\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 antoine antoine      4096 avril  3 10:28 cmake\r\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 antoine antoine    491292 avril  1 21:02 parquet.lib\r\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 antoine antoine 128473780 avril  1 21:03 parquet_static.lib\r\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 antoine antoine      4096 avril  3 10:27 pkgconfig\r\n```\r\n(see files in https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/arrow-cpp/files )\r\n\r\nWe should probably only ship dynamic libraries under Windows, as those are reasonably small.\r\n",

So it makes sense to still ship static libraries on Unix if it doesn't pose a problem."

This seems to be the default for mostly all conda packages and the preferred way of Linux distributions. We have mostly added static libraries in our dependencies in conda-forge in the beginning of Arrow development as Arrow wanted to have static libs.\u00a0"
