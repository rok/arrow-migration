Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe default fix version (1.11.0) for Parquet issues is resulting in the wrong fix version being set sometimes when committers merge PARQUET-\\* patches. Since we only have C++ Parquet issues, I think we can safely only suggest the cpp-\\* fix versions",
