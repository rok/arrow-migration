We have the lossy conversion (to float64) implemented from Arrow to R. If you want lossless handling of Decimal\\* data, there's now the option to do all of the manipulation in Arrow with its richer type system, driving it from R. \r\n\r\nI'll close this but we can revisit if/whenever a native R implementation for Decimal data appears.
