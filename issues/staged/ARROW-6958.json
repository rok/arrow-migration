Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRunning the arrow example for pyspark ([found here\u00a0\\|[https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/python/sql/arrow.py]]) causes a\u00a0java.lang.IllegalArgumentException error. Running the same script with pyarrow v 0.8.0 causes the script to run correctly.\r\n\r\nAttached are the startup settings in google dataproc I'm using to create the cluster, as well as the output (with error text). It isn't immediately obvious to me what is causing the issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
