Reading the test, it uses R to first strftime and then tests that Arrow and R both strptime that back, so it could be an R quirk: R recognizes and can do something with this strptime token round trip, but our library doesn't. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't know which token it is though because these tests are run in a for loop and the failure message doesn't say which token is the one that is failing. testthat does provide some facilities for reporting useful things within a loop, so we should wire those up. \r\n\r\nIn addition to better handling of tests in a loop, we should probably just skip this whole thing on CRAN.",
