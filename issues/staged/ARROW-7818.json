        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7818](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7818). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe goal of this feature is to support generating kernels at compile time (and possibly runtime if gandiva is linked) to avoid rewriting C++ kernels that gandiva knows how to compile. The generated kernels would be linked in the compute module. \r\n\r\nThis is an experimental task that will guide future development, notably implementing aggregate kernels in gandiva once instead both C++ and gandiva implementations.",
