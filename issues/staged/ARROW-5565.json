Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt may not be obvious to new developers how to set breakpoints in the C++ libraries when driven from Python. The incantation is slightly abstruse, for example\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n$ gdb --args env py.test pyarrow/tests/test_array.py -k scalars_mixed_type\r\n```",

However you need the actual executable to appear as first argument, e.g.:\r\n```Java\n\r\ngdb --args python -m pytest pyarrow/tests/test_array.py\r\n```\r\n"
