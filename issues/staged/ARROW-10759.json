        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10759](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10759). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf DataFusion had support for creating date literals using a cast expression such as\u00a0\r\n CAST('2019-01-01'\u00a0AS\u00a0DATE) this would allow a user-friendly way for direct (and therefore more efficient) comparison of date columns to scalar values (compared to representing dates as strings and then resorting to string comparison).\r\n I already have a basic implementation that works, just have to add some more tests.",
