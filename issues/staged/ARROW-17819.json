        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17819). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe process for building the tutorial documentation (see: apache/arrow/docs/source/developers/documentation.rst) identifies PyArrow as a requirement\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would not be necessary to install PyArrow to modify text documentation for Java or any other language.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFWIW, On my machine, the PyArrow install has been running for over 20 minutes with repeated failure messages:\r\n\r\n`conda install -c conda-forge pyarrow`\r\n\r\n`Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done`\r\n`Solving environment: failed with initial frozen solve. Retrying with flexible solve.`\r\n`Solving environment: failed with repodata from current_repodata.json, will retry with next repodata source.`\r\n`Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done`\r\n`Solving environment: failed with initial frozen solve. Retrying with flexible solve.`\r\n`Solving environment: |`\r\n\r\nAt this point I cancelled this and used pip to install, which finished successfully almost immediately. However, the next step (run\u00a0{_}**python setup.py install**{_}) also failed. And failed again when I tried to run it in a dedicated Conda environment. \u00a0\r\n\r\nRather than continue with that, I tried to run the java documentation script:\u00a0(run **_make java_tutorial_** in the arrow docs folder)\u00a0and it was able to execute without issue, so I could see my changes as HTML. \u00a0",

High-level, we have two related issues that can help with this:\r\n\r\n- ARROW-13159: removing the use of the IPython directive (and thus from _running_ code examples while building he docs) should help allowing building the python docs without an actual pyarrow installation (in addition, we would need to allow to skip the reference docs)\n- ARROW-15117: splitting our docs in multiple sphinx projects, so that the python docs is a separate doc build, and thus you can build for example the developer docs without having to also build the python docs\n  \n  Short term, there are actually some workarounds to build a part of the docs, which is documented here: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/developers/documentation.html#building-a-single-directory-for-dev-purposes-without-all-the-pre-requisites "

In general I would recommend to use mamba instead (but let's move this conversation elsewhere)"
