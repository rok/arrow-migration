Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we access a row from a table or a struct, we create a proxy for the struct. We could improve the performance of these accesses by creating a single instance of the proxy and store it on the vector or the data type and then reuse that instance. \r\n\r\nThis should improve performance. \r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/7029f90ea3b39e97f1a671227ca932cbcdbcee05/js/src/visitor/get.ts#L219 and https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/7029f90ea3b39e97f1a671227ca932cbcdbcee05/js/src/vector/struct.ts#L27.
