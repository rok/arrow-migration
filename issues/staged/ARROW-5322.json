Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are many parquet files generated in our customers environment that can be read by Java parquet readers but not C parquet readers or pyarrow.\r\n\r\nReason being Java readers\u00a0handles\u00a0\"dictionaryPageOffset = 0\" to determine if dictionary page exists where as the C readers uses \"has_dictionaryPageOffset\" (_isset bit in thrift message) to determine the same resulting in incompatible behaviour. This incompatibility is curbing the pyarrow usage in our customers env.\r\n\r\nMaking this change makes C parquet readers and pyarrow more usable and compatible to java parquet readers.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
