        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4481](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4481). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe instructions for publishing the web site say to run the \"scripts/sync_format_docs.sh\" which copies the top level \"format\" directory to the \"_docs\" directory under site.\r\n\r\nExisting files in \"_docs\" have references to markdown files in the \"_docs/format\" directory. For example, the IPC.md contains:\r\n```java\n\r\n{% include_relative format/IPC.md %}\n```\r\nHowever my top level format directory does not contain this IPC.md, so I get errors when running jekyll and I have had to create some dummy markdown files as a workaround.\r\n\r\nI investigated this a bit and I think there is some prerequisite step that isn't documented that would cause Sphinx to run and generate docs?",
