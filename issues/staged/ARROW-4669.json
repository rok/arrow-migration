Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile reviewing some code I realized that there is no bounds checking on ArrowBuf slicing. Example negative test case that should pass but is currently failing can be found here:\u00a0\r\n\r\n<https://gist.github.com/jacques-n/737c26b7016ed29dc710d4aba617340e>\r\n\r\nIt may be that this doesn't cause\u00a0more problems because the index checks do exist on memory access but fixing this would make it much easier to understand where a code mistake was made.",
