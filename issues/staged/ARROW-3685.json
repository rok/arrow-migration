Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm working on getting support for arrow in vaex (out of core dataframe library for Python) in this PR:\r\n<https://github.com/maartenbreddels/vaex/pull/116>\r\nAnd I\u00a0fixed length binary arrays for numpy (say dtype='S42') will be converted to a non-fixed length array. Trying to convert that back to numpy will\u00a0fail, since there is no such conversion.\r\n\r\nIt makes more sense to convert dtype='S42', to an arrow array with pyarrow.binary(42) type. As I do in:\r\nhttps://github.com/maartenbreddels/vaex/blob/4b4facb64fea9f83593ce0f0b82fc26ddf96b506/packages/vaex-arrow/vaex_arrow/convert.py#L4",

You can pass a fixed-size type to `pyarrow.array` to override this"
