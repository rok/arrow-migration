Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe email template to send to the dev for vote yields\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n[4]: https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/centos-rc/4.0.1-rc1\r\n[5]: https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/debian-rc/4.0.1-rc1\r\n[6]: https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/python-rc/4.0.1-rc1\r\n[7]: https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/ubuntu-rc/4.0.1-rc1\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever, these are always 404, as the distros are directory-based. This should probably be without `/4.0.1-rc1`, since the 4.0.1-rc1 is split between the different sub-directories.\r\n",
