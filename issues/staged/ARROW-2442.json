Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1852#discussion_r179919627>\r\n\r\nThere are various `Append()` overloads in Builder and subclasses, some of which append one value, some of which append multiple values at once.\r\n\r\nThe API might be clearer and less error-prone if multiple-append variants were named differently, for example `AppendValues()`. Especially with the pointer-taking variants, it's probably easy to call the wrong overload by mistake.\r\n\r\nThe existing methods would have to go through a deprecation cycle.",
