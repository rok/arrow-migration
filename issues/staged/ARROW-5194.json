Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI believe the [assertions](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/plasma/test/serialization_tests.cc#L191) here are incorrect. You can't use memcmp to compare structs\r\n On my machine (64bits linux) int are 4 bytes, but the struct fields are 8 bytes aligned, so this line fails:\r\n\r\nASSERT_EQ(memcmp(&plasma_objects[object_ids[0]], &plasma_objects_return[0],\r\n sizeof(PlasmaObject)),\r\n 0);\r\n\r\neven though the struct contents are the same.",
