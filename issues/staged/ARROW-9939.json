Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs suggested by `[~andygrove]`  on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8097/files#r484556394\r\n\r\n> I've been thinking lately that we should start standardizing on children rather than inputs. \r\n\r\nI think `children` is a more standard term and having consistent terminology across the datafusion code base will be valuable\r\n",
