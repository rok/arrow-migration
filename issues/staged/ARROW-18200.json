Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI made a mistake before where I thought a dataset contained CSVs which were, in fact, Parquet files, but the error message I got was super unhelpful\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\n\r\ndownload.file(\r\n  url = \"https://github.com/djnavarro/arrow-user2022/releases/download/v0.1/nyc-taxi-tiny.zip\",\r\n  destfile = here::here(\"data/nyc-taxi-tiny.zip\")\r\n)\r\n# (unzip the zip file into the data directory but don't delete it after)\r\n\r\nopen_dataset(\"data\", format = \"csv\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nError in nchar(x) : invalid multibyte string, element 1\r\nIn addition: Warning message:\r\nIn grepl(\"No match for FieldRef.Name(__filename)\", msg, fixed = TRUE) :\r\n  input string 1 is invalid in this locale\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, this only occurs with `format=\"csv\"` and omitting this argument (i.e. the default of `format=\"parquet\"` leaves us with the much better error:\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nError in `open_dataset()`:\r\n! Invalid: Error creating dataset.
