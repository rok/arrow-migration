Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is follow up work to ARROW-2106; since pandas.Timestamp supports nanoseconds, this will require a slightly different code path. Tests should also include using `Table.from_pandas`",

We should maybe write a function to assist with the check `isinstance(x, pandas.Timestamp` (or any class on the RHS). As far as getting the nanosecond value, the easiest thing might be to access the `value` attribute"
