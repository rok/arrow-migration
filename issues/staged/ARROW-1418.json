        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1418](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1418). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the first iteration of the Python serialization code, we used global variables to store the custom serialization and deserialization callback functions. This global state is undesirable because if the user wants to use different serialization callbacks with different types registered, they need to remember resetting the state. As Wes suggested, a good way to address this is by introducing a SerializationContext that has the callbacks and gets passed around.",
