Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm building a process to take data from pyarrow Tables and write their data a memory mapped file in a custom format.\u00a0 Currently, I iterate through the arrow table and must call as_py() only to convert the python value to bytes and write to the memory mapped file.\u00a0 If the pyarrow scalar API provided a view over the underlying storage, I could simply memcopy the values from the arrow buffer into the mmap buffer.",
