Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~edrevo]` noticed, on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9523#issuecomment-786237494, that the use of crossbeam channels can potentially deadlock datafusion\r\n\r\nThe use of crossbeam channel is left over from earlier, non `async` implementations and get been fingered in some hangs that `[~MikeSeddonAU]` has observed in DataFusion ). Specifically the crossbeam channel can block a thread when the channel is full or empty, which can result in blocking all the tokio executor threads and deadlocking the system\r\n\r\nThe proposal is is to use tokio's mpsc channels instead of crossbeam which can properly yield back to tokio to run another task when the channel is either full or empty. .\r\n",
