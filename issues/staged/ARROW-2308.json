        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2308](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2308). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/1658>\u00a0for an example of this issue. Non-aligned data can trigger a copy when fed into TensorFlow and things like that.\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = np.zeros(10)\r\ny = pa.deserialize(pa.serialize(x).to_buffer())\r\n\r\nx.ctypes.data % 64  # 0 (it starts out aligned)\r\ny.ctypes.data % 64  # 48 (it is no longer aligned)\r\n```\r\nIt should be possible to fix this by calling something like `RETURN_NOT_OK(AlignStreamPosition(dst));` before writing the array data. Note that we already do this before writing the tensor header, but the tensor header is not necessarily a multiple of 64 bytes, so the subsequent data can be unaligned.",
