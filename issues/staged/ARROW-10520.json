Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8579 the R client can remove, add and replace columns in an arrow table. But it can't currently do the same for RecordBatch. From `[~npr]`: As it turns out, that will require a little more C++ work because there is AddColumn and RemoveColumn but no SetColumn in record_batch.h.",
