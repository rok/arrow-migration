Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\nThere seem to be several minor issues in Layout.md: \n\n1. In the example for Struct type (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Layout.md#struct-type), the second array element is \"{null, 2}\" in the text, but in the Arrow representation, the value buffer for field 0 has \"bob\" in the corresponding slot. Either the text should be changed from \"null\" to \"bob\", or the Null count, Null bitmap buffer, and Offsets buffer should be changed to count the second element in field 0 as null. \n\n2. In the same Struct type example, the third element in the Struct array is \"null\" in text, but the value buffer for field 1 has 3 in the corresponding slot in the Arrow representation. The Null count, Null bitmap buffer, and Value buffer should be changed to count the third element in field 1 as null.\n\n3. In the Dictionary encoding section (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Layout.md#dictionary-encoding), there is a missing reference to \"Message.fbs\". \n",

I agree that your changes make the example in particular more clear (as though we were constructing the struct from the input data), though"
