        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3877](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3877). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs follow up to ARROW-3831, some compression libraries have a function to provide a hint for sizing the output buffer (if it is not known already) for one-shot decompression. This would be helpful for sizing allocations in such cases",

Some compressors require the uncompressed length so in that case NotImplemented would be returned"
