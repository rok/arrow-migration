Now writing is boiled down to a single function `arrow::ipc::feather::WriteTable` which can fail. \r\n\r\nIn Python we have this scenario guarded with try/except to make sure that the file handle is cleaned up (we got identical bug reports): https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/feather.py#L179"
