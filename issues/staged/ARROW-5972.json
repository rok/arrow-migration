Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee example build:\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/558986931\r\n\r\nHere, installing cargo-tarpaulin takes 13m32s. Running the coverage report takes another 7m40s. \r\n\r\nGiven the Travis CI build queue issues we're having, this might be worth optimizing or moving to Docker/Buildbot",

We have a PR\u00a0[1] to re-enable coverage, but it would be useful to not place it in builds, as it doubles the build time due to the fact that tarpaulin requires a different compilation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7797/files"
