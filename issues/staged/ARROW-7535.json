This is a cron GHA job, so it doesn't show up in our nightly crossbow email. \r\n\r\nIt looks like it's been failing since ARROW-7435 merged.",

I haven't found a way to selectively subscribe. And there appears that there is no Actions API we can query when making the nightly crossbow email. So I'm not sure that GHA is currently a good solution for nightly builds for us at this time."
