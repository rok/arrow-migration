        "title": "Duplicated binaries in the python package",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7728](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7728). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it is a desired feature or not, but there's no \"question\" issue type, so I'm opening it as a bug - please correct if necessary.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMost of binary files in the python \"pyarrow\" package are present in two versions, e.g.:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nlibarrow.so\r\nlibarrow.so.15\r\n```\r\nor\u00a0\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nlibarrow.dylib\r\nlibarrow.15.dylib\r\n```\r\n(I presume, that \".15\" correspond to the version of pyarrow?).\r\n\r\nWhich are actually identical:\r\n```java\n\r\n$ diff libarrow.15.dylib libarrow.dylib  # returns nothing\r\n```\r\nSo let me ask:\r\n - Is it necessary to have both of them in the distribution?\r\n\r\n - Which one is actually imported, and is it safe to remove another one?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOut of 130 MB of full pyarrow, 105 MB are those binaries, so removing duplicates would save quite some space (especially important if using pyarrow in AWS lambdas where the function is limited in size).\u00a0",
