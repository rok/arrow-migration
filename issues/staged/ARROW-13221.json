Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs soon as some optimizations are enabled, `src/parquet/arrow/arrow_reader_writer_test.cc` becomes extremely slow to compile (more than one minute just for itself). This is perceivable on e.g. the `conda-cpp-valgrind` build where we add `-Og` to the gcc flags in order to make the tests less slow under emulation.",
