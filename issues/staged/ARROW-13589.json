Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of having entirely separate implementations for these functions, it seems the expensive checks can simply be toggled using a boolean flag inside a common implementation (as is already done for `Scalar::Validate`). Whether or not this makes the code more readable / shorter / more maintainable must be evaluated.",
