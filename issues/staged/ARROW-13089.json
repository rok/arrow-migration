Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere's already `Table.to_pydict()` and `Table.from_pydict()` methods , but only `RecordBatch.to_pydict()`. Perhaps, we should also add `RecordBatch.from_pydict()` to make the API consistent.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

They seem to have identical interfaces. Wouldn't it better to depreciate one of them?"
