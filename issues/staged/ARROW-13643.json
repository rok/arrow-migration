        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13643](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13643). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nResidual predicates are evaluated after finding matches using equality condition on key columns, but before deciding whether an input had a match for the join and resolving outer references. They allow to implement in a simple (but potentially inefficient) way inequality predicates that accompany equality predicates in join condition.",
