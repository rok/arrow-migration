Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowing the discussion at <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1689,> there are a few issues with conversion of various types to arrow that are incorrect or could be improved:\r\n \\* PyBytes_GET_SIZE is being casted to the wrong type, for example \r\n`const int32_t length = static_cast<int32_t>(PyBytes_GET_SIZE(obj));`\r\n\r\n \\* Handle the possibility with the statement\r\n`builder->value_data_length() + length > kBinaryMemoryLimit`\r\nif length is larger than kBinaryMemoryLimit\r\n\r\n \\* Look into using common code for binary object conversion to avoid duplication, and allow support for bytes and bytearray objects in other places than numpy_to_arrow.  (possibly put in src/arrow/python/helpers.h)",
