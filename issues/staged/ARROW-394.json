Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow with ARROW-384, ARROW-392 resolved, we can expand the integration tests to a reasonably broad set of types. Then we should be able to make a 0.2 release of the project.\n\nFor now these will be hand-generated \u2013 we'll want to create a test data generator in Python to create JSON files for testing. \n\nAside: I'm not sure how to deal with Binary types in JSON \u2013 probably as a list of integers",
