        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5879](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5879). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOptional modules such as\r\n\r\n- Flight (and its dependents, including OpenSSL)\n- Parquet\n- Gandiva\n  \n  are all linked unconditionally to `pyarrow.lib`. It would be better IMHO to only link these libraries to the corresponding Cython extension rather than link everything to every extension.\n  \n  Relatedly, libraries like OpenSSL are being included in linking with all shared libraries. We should clean this up to only link to the relevant shared libraries where it is required, like `libparquet` (for encryption support) and `libarrow_flight` (for using gRPC with TLS)",
