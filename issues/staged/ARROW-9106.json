Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn some situations (e.g. reading a Windows-produced CSV file), the user might transcode data before ingesting it into Arrow. Rather than build transcoding in C++ (which would require a library of encodings), we could delegate it to bindings as needed, by providing a generic InputStream facility.",
