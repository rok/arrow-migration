Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf I build the cpp library with MSVC for windows and try to use the hdfs io interface, the dynamic library loads fail.\n\nThe reason is that in file hdfs-internal.cc on two occasions the __WIN32 define is checked instead of _WIN32. The former is not set by MSVC. I checked that these are the only two locations in the arrow library where the flag __WIN32 is used, so all we need to do is replace these two references in  hdfs-internal.cc.",
