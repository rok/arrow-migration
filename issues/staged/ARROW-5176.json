        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5176](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5176). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) is a tool for automatically formatting python code in ways which flake8 and our other linters approve of. Adding it to the project will allow more reliably formatted python code and fill a similar role to `clang-format` for c++ and `cmake-format` for cmake",

One of the major benefits is that it is not configurable and thus also saves us from long discussions about styling."

At a minimum we should\u00a0add a pre-commit hook that runs flake8 (per the [dev instructions](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/python.rst#coding-style)). I got a Travis failure\u00a0for linting, and IMO that should never happen."
