        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18163](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18163). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nContext: we're creating a new data format for computer vision (https://github.com/eto-ai/lance) with a C++ core.\r\n\r\nWe've implemented the integration so you can read Lance datasets into pyarrow like:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport lance\r\nimport pyarrow.dataset as ds\r\n\r\nds.dataset(uri, format=lance.LanceFileFormat())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould it possible to create a file format registry? like: \r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nds.register_file_format(\r\n    ext='lance', \r\n    format=lance.LanceFileFormat(),\r\n    dataset=lance.FileSystemDataset\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would enable: `ds.dataset('/my/dataset.lance')` to execute successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe optional third argument would be to help expose format specific optimizations. e.g, Lance has much better random access performance so pushing limit/offset parameters to Lance allows for much faster paging, especially over deeply nested data and/or image blobs.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
