Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDocumentation for PyArrow 6.x and 7.x both indicate that the `validate_schema` argument is supported in the `ParquetDataset` class. Yet passing that argument to an instance results in:\r\n\r\nValueError: Keyword 'validate_schema' is not yet supported with the new Dataset API\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```python\n\r\nparquet_dataset = pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset(\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 path_or_paths=paths,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 validate_schema=validate_schema,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 filesystem=filesystem,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 partitioning=partitioning,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 use_legacy_dataset=False,\r\n)\n```\r\nDocs link:\r\n\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/6.0/python/generated/pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset.html>\r\n\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/7.0/python/generated/pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset.html>\u00a0",
