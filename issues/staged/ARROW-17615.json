I've pushed a PR on the cookbooks to add the ability to build against Nightlies and have modified our build there to be compatible with both 9.0.0 and the current Nightlies. We probably can close this ticket as it seems using COMPONENTS was never supported (even though in the past the build did not fail if they were used). Thanks for your support Kou!\r\n\r\nHere the cookbooks PR in case you want to take a look:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow-cookbook/pull/252/files"
