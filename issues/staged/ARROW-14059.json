Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nProposed updates:\r\n \\* Define what is meant by \"reader\" and \"writer\" before using those terms\r\n \\* Add some more code examples to the vignette to break up the text\r\n \\* Remove backticks from package names to make it easier to skim (see dplyr vignette)\r\n \\* Move \"Object Hierarchy\" and \"Internals\" sections\" into their own vignette and link to it\r\n \\* Break up the \"Class structure and package conventions\" section so that the code examples are in chunks rather than inline, and it's more skimmable.\u00a0 Perhaps add subsections to help with this aim too.",
