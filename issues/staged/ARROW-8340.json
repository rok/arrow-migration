This is already fixed upstream (https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/issues/451), but it seems the latest release is not yet on conda-forge (so installing it with eg pip locally solved it for me).\r\n"

So we will need to wait on a new breathe release anyway before we can see to use sphinx 3.0 here."
