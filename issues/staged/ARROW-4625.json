Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now in Java, you must manually busy-wait in a loop as the gRPC server's awaitTermination method isn't exposed. Conversely, in C+, you have no choice but to busy-wait as starting the server calls awaitTermination for you. Either Java should also wait on the server, or both Java and C+ should expose an explicit operation to wait on the server.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the latter as then the Python bindings could choose to manually busy-wait, which would let Ctrl-C work as normal.",
