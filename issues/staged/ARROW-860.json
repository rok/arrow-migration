Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/560. Since this is primarily a data container (only `arrow::Tensor` being used in Python, for example), and the subclasses are quite a bit of work to wrap, it's unclear whether they are of high value to maintain.
