        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16914](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16914). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe've [given advice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59939033/2048858) to use `ExternalProject_Add` to build Arrow from source within a users CMake project. (Correct me if I am wrong that that is the preferred method now.) But I found it non-trivial to implement this.\r\n\r\nWe should add a simple example of doing this to the User Guide. We should also mention that we don't support `add_subdirectory` as that seems to be a common gotcha as well.\r\n\r\nThis might overlap with ARROW-9740, but I don't quite understand what that issue is proposing.",

We don't support `add_subdirectory()`.\r\n\r\nBTW, we may be able to provide an example that uses https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html instead of `ExternalProject_Add()`. `ExternalProject_Add()` builds Apache Arrow at build time but `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()` build Apache Arrow at configure time. It means that users can use `find_package(Arrow)` with `FetchContent_MakeAavailable()` instead of `add_library(arrow_shared SHARED IMPORT)` with `ExternalProject_Add()`.\r\n\r\nI don't know details of ARROW-9740 too but I think that we can work on this as a separated task of ARROW-9740."

I tried it and understand that it's not for this use case. Sorry...\r\n\r\n`FetchContent` just downloads at configure time. It doesn't build at configure time. So we can't use `find_package(Arrow)` with `FetchContent`.\r\n\r\nIt seems that we need to use \"superbuild\" https://www.kitware.com/cmake-superbuilds-git-submodules/ to use `find_package(Arrow)` but it may be difficult to use in most projects."
