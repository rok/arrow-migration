Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter installing `apache-arrow` and `apache-arrow-glib` via `Homebrew` according to the [Installation Guide](https://arrow.apache.org/install/), I wrote a very simple program to test if they were successfully installed.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n$ cat hello_world.c\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\n#include <arrow-glib/arrow-glib.h>\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n    printf(\"Hello, World! \\n\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`gcc` gave the following error:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n$ gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c\r\nIn file included from hello_world.c:3:\r\nIn file included from /usr/local/include/arrow-glib/arrow-glib.h:22:\r\n/usr/local/include/arrow-glib/gobject-type.h:22:10: fatal error: 'glib-object.h' file not found\r\n#include <glib-object.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any step that I didn\u2019t follow here?\r\n",
