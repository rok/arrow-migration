Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`r/configure.win` fails to write the contents of `r/src/Makevars.win` when it finds more than one version of the libarrow binaries in `r/windows/`. Fix this by finding only the libarrow binary with the highest version number if there is more than one present.",
