Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6257#pullrequestreview-347506792>\r\n\r\nThe argument to FileSystemFromUri should always be rfc3986 formatted. The current fallback to localfs can be recovered by adding\u00a0`static string Uri::FromPath(string)` which wraps [uriWindowsFilenameToUriStringA](https://uriparser.github.io/doc/api/latest/Uri_8h.html#a422dc4a2b979ad380a4dfe007e3de845) and the corresponding unix path function.\r\n```java\n\r\nFileSystemFromUri(Uri::FromPath(R\"(E:\\dir\\file.txt)\"), &sanitized) \n```\r\nThis is a little more boilerplate but I think it's worthwhile to be explicit here.",
