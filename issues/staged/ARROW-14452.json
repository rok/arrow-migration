Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe release testing and verification script at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh uses an older version of the npm install script.  The testing command may also fail to complete correctly on some platforms because the commands are all on one line. In particular, node default installation may not contain run-s see [npm cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands), and the [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all) package would need to be added or the commands split into three separate lines. If the verifier passes on their own npm installation with npm-run-all installed, then tests should pass.",
