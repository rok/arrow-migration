        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18255). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOver at <https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/5425,> we cross-compile Arrow to make it easily available within the Julia ecosystem. This will for example enable a GDAL with Arrow/Parquet driver support that can be installed for everyone.\r\n\r\nWe noticed when going from v9 to v10, `armv6` (or any non-defined cpu architecture really) now gives an error when compiling. The change is in `cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake`. We now patch the code by giving armv6 the same status as armv7, which seems to work.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to not error out on unknown platforms? A warning with this platform is not officially supported could be an alternative. Or, the other way, you could confirm that armv6 (and others) are just _really_ unsupported (as in probably breaking) and we should not attempt to compile for those platforms?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
