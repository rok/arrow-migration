Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\r\n\r\n\u2014 \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is code in the datafusion physical planner that coerces arguments to compatible types for some expressions (e.g. for equals: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/rust/datafusion/src/physical_plan/expressions.rs#L1153)\r\n\r\nThis code needs to be modified to understand dictionary types (so, for example we can express a predicate like col1 = \"foo\", where col1 is a DictionaryArray.\r\n\r\n",
