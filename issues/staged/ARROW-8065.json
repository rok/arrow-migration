        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8065](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8065). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently: a fragment is a product of a scan; it is a lazy collection of scan tasks corresponding to a data source which is logically singular (like a single file, a single row group, ...). It would be more useful if instead a fragment were the direct object of a scan; one scans a fragment (or a collection of fragments):\r\n\r\n1. Remove `ScanOptions` from Fragment's properties and move it into `Fragment::Scan` parameters.\n1. Remove `ScanOptions` from `Dataset::GetFragments`. We can provide an overload to support predicate pushdown in FileSystemDataset and UnionDataset `Dataset::GetFragments(std::shared_ptr<Expression> predicate)`.\n1. Expose lazy accessor to Fragment::physical_schema()\n1. Consolidate ScanOptions and ScanContext\n   \n   This will lessen the cognitive dissonance between fragments and files since fragments will no longer include references to scan properties.\n",
