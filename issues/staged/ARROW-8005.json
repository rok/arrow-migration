        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8005](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8005). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nASF Infra has communicated\r\n\r\n\"As of March 2020, we are deprecating www.apache.org/dist/ in favor of\r\nhttps://downloads.apache.org/ for backup downloads as well as signature\r\nand checksum verification. The primary driver has been splitting up web\r\nsite visits and downloads to gain better control and offer a better\r\nservice for both downloads and web site visits.\r\n\r\nAs stated, this does not impact end-users, and should have a minimal\r\nimpact on projects, as our download selectors as well as visits to\r\nwww.apache.org/dist/ have been adjusted to make use of\r\ndownloads.apache.org instead. We do however ask that projects, in their\r\nown time-frame, change references on their own web sites from\r\nwww.apache.org/dist/ to downloads.apache.org wherever such references\r\nmay exist, to complete the switch in full. We will NOT be turning off\r\nwww.apache.org/dist/ in the near future, but would greatly appreciate if\r\nprojects could help us transition away from the old URLs in their\r\ndocumentation and on their download pages.\r\n\r\nThe standard way of uploading releases[1] will STILL apply, however\r\nthere may be a short delay (<= 15 minutes) between releasing and\r\nreleases showing up on downloads.apache.org for technical reasons.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nWe should adjust our website and if necessary our release scripts based on this",
