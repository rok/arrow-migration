Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, dictionary keys use a NullIterator to iterate them. However, physically, they are fully allocated in memory and are interpretable as a PrimitiveArray.\r\n\r\nThis issue's main purpose is to have `keys` return a `PrimitiveArray`, so that users can use it as any other array.\r\n\r\nThis will also allow to remove `NullIter`.",
