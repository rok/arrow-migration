        "title": "[Python] PyArrow datatypes raise ValueError on equality checks against non-PyArrow objects",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2423](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2423). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nChecking a PyArrow datatype object for equality with non-PyArrow datatypes causes a `ValueError` to be raised, rather than either returning a True/False value, or returning\u00a0[NotImplemented](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented) if the comparison isn't implemented.\r\n\r\nE.g. attempting to call:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow\r\npyarrow.int32() == 'foo'\r\n```\r\nresults in:\r\n```java\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"types.pxi\", line 1221, in pyarrow.lib.type_for_alias\r\nKeyError: 'foo'\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"t.py\", line 2, in <module>\r\n    pyarrow.int32() == 'foo'\r\n  File \"types.pxi\", line 90, in pyarrow.lib.DataType.__richcmp__\r\n  File \"types.pxi\", line 113, in pyarrow.lib.DataType.equals\r\n  File \"types.pxi\", line 1223, in pyarrow.lib.type_for_alias\r\nValueError: No type alias for foo\r\n```\r\nThe expected outcome for the above would be for the comparison to return `False`, as that's the general behaviour for comparisons between objects of different types (e.g. `1 == 'foo'` or `object() == 12.4` both return `False`).",
