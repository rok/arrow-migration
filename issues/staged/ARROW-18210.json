Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently StreamWriter is slower only because of checking of columns, if we allow customization option (maybe ctor arg) to skip the check then StreamWriter can be more efficient?",

I don't think you can expect excellent performance from `{}StreamWriter{`}. Parquet is a columnar format, so you should feed the data column-wise rather than row-wise. Take a look at the `TypedColumnWriter` class and ensure you write data in batches."
