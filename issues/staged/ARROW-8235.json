        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8235](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8235). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe filter kernel currently emits null when a slot in the selection mask is null. For compatibility with Kleene logic systems like SQL, this behavior should be configurable. Provide an option enumeration:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nstruct FilterOptions {\r\n  enum NullSelectionBehavior {\r\n    /// null slots in the selection mask will drop the filtered value\r\n    DROP,\r\n    /// null slots in the selection mask will keep the filtered value\r\n    KEEP,\r\n    /// null slots in the selection mask will replace the filtered value with null\r\n    EMIT_NULL,\r\n  } null_selection_behavior;\r\n};\r\n```",
