Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI believe that the apt package is built without S3 support. But s3fs.h is exported in filesystem/api.h anyway. This creates undefined reference errors when trying to link to the package.",
