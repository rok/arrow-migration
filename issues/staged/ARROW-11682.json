I don't recommend this as a global setting though because it will likely be significantly slower. \r\n\r\nThere's some discussion on ARROW-11478 to improve this experience, please feel free to chime in there if you have opinions. And see ARROW-6582 and the linked pull request if you're interested in more details on how we got here. \r\n\r\n"
