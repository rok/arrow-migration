Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi team! I've been unable to install older numpy versions (including 1.19.4 as specified here f[or aarch64 machine](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/requirements-wheel-build.txt)s) on my Apple Silicon machine because the build process throws a number of numpy compilation errors. I've been able to successfully install numpy 1.20.2 however - is it possible to bump up the numpy acceptable version number to enable Apple silicon installations?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Any opinons `[~uwe]`?\r\n"
