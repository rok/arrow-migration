Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently,\u00a0 the client side git pre-commit hook checks and runs `cargo fmt` with stable version, but the CI check may fail in nightly version occasionally even if the code has been formatted with stable.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, this problem can be resolved by: running `cargo +nighty fmt` before\u00a0 `cargo\u00a0+stable fmt`. Thus `pre-commit.sh` should be updated in this way.",
