        "title": "A bit confused by arrow::install_arrow() inR",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6169). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAm trying to get up and running on arrow from R for the first time (macOS Mojave 10.14.6)\r\n\r\nStarted with\r\n```r\n\r\ninstall.packages('arrow') #success!\r\nwrite_parquet(iris, 'tmp.parquet') #oh no!\n```\r\nand hit the error:\r\n\r\n>\u00a0Error in `Table\\_\\_from\\_dots(dots, schema)` : Cannot call `Table\\_\\_from\\_dots()`. Please use `arrow::install_arrow()` to install required runtime libraries.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOK, easy enough:\r\n```r\n\r\narrow::install_arrow()\u00a0\r\n```\r\nWith output:\r\n```java\n\r\nYou may be able to get a development version of the Arrow C++ library using Homebrew: `brew install apache-arrow --HEAD` Or, see the Arrow C++ developer guide <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp.html> for instructions on building the library from source.\r\n\r\nAfter you've installed the C++ library, you'll need to reinstall the R package from source to find it.\r\n\r\nRefer to the R package README <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/README.md> for further details.\r\n\r\nIf you have other trouble, or if you think this message could be improved, please report an issue here: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ARROW/issues>\r\n```\r\nA few points of confusion for me as a first time user:\r\n\r\nA bit surprised I'm being directed to install the development version? If the current CRAN version of `arrow` is only compatible with the dev version, I guess that could be made more clear in this message. But on the other hand, the linked GH README suggests the opposite: \"On macOS and Windows, installing a binary package from CRAN will handle Arrow\u2019s C++ dependencies for you.\" However, that doesn't appear to have been the case for me.\r\n\r\nOh well, let's just try installing the normal version & see if that works:\r\n```r\n\r\n$brew install apache-arrow\r\n>install.packages('arrow') #reinstall in fresh session\r\n>arrow::write_parquet(iris, 'tmp.parquet') # same error\n```\r\nNow I try the dev version:\r\n```r\n\r\nbrew install apache-arrow --HEAD\r\n# Error: apache-arrow 0.14.1 is already installed\r\n# To install HEAD, first run `brew unlink apache-arrow`.\r\nbrew unlink apache-arrow\r\nbrew install apache-arrow --HEAD\r\n# Error: An exception occurred within a child process:\r\n# RuntimeError: /usr/local/opt/autoconf not present or broken\r\n# Please reinstall autoconf. Sorry :(\r\nbrew install autoconf\r\nbrew install apache-arrow --HEAD\r\n# Error: An exception occurred within a child process:\r\n# RuntimeError: /usr/local/opt/cmake not present or broken\r\n# Please reinstall cmake. Sorry :(\r\nbrew install cmake\r\nbrew install apache-arrow --HEAD\r\n# cmake ../cpp -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE=-DNDEBUG -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=-DNDEBUG -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/Cellar/apache-arrow/HEAD-908b058 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK=LAST -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFIL\r\n# Last 15 lines from /Users/michael.chirico/Library/Logs/Homebrew/apache-arrow/01.cmake:\r\n# dlopen(/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/_multiarray_umath.cpython-37m-darwin.so,\r\n# 2): Symbol not found: ___addtf3\r\n# Referenced from: /usr/local/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/9/libquadmath.0.dylib\r\n# Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib\r\n# in /usr/local/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/9/libquadmath.0.dylib\r\n# Call Stack (most recent call first):\r\n# src/arrow/python/CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package)\n```\r\nPoked around a bit about that\u00a0error and what I see suggests re-installing `scipy` but that didn't work (`pip install scipy` nor `pip3 install scipy`, though the traceback does suggest it's a Python 3 thing)\r\n\r\nSo now I'm stuck & not sure how to proceed.\r\n\r\nI'll also add that I'm not sure what to make of this:\r\n\r\n>\u00a0After you've installed the C++ library, you'll need to reinstall the R package from source to find it.\r\n\r\nWhat is \"find it\" referring to exactly? And installing from source here means `R CMD build && R CMD INSTALL` on the cloned repo?",
