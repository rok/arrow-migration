        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3260](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3260). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen pushing changes I get routinely frustrated because Travis-CI fails early on a linting failure. It would be nice if linting (Python, C++) was a separate job so as not to disrupt the development workflow so much.",
