Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI probably introduced this bug some time ago, but there was another bug in the benchmark setup that caused the query to not be executed, only planned.\r\n\r\nDatafusion should probably also support queries like\r\n\r\nSELECT foo, bar\r\n  FROM table\r\n ORDER BY 1, 2\r\n\r\nBut for now the easiest fix for the benchmark would be to specify the column name instead of the index.",
