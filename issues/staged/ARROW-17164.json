Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the compute layer exposes several high-level facilities to execute a compute function: `CallFunction` and `Function::Execute`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you'd favor a two-step approach of first resolving the `Kernel` for a given set of argument types, then execute the kernel, then you're forced to deal with the rather cumbersome `Kernel` execution interface.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the base `Kernel` class had something similar to the `Function::Execute` method.\r\n",
