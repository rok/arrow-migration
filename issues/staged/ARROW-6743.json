Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe probably want to do this at some point. It will remove one fragility in the build system (currently, we select whether we need `boost::filesystem` or not depending on the selected build options, then set the `ARROW_WITH_BOOST_FILESYSTEM` macro that triggers compiling different versions of a couple utility functions).",
