        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16271](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16271). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-15928 enables this function to accept chunked arrays for the input array, but not for the mask or replacements array. More work is needed to implement those cases (which currently just return an error).\r\n\r\nWe should also consider how to make this work at least somewhat reusable for similar kernels (e.g. replace_with_indices)",
