Something like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  std::shared_ptr<Table> table = ...\r\n  ARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK(arrow::compute::MakeExecNode(\r\n      \"table\", plan, {}, arrow::compute::TableSourceOptions{table.get()}));\r\n```",

Otherwise a project node is sufficient).\r\n\r\nThe only parameter that probably makes sense is batch size.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use InMemoryDataset then that is one possible implementation.  You can just hide the creation of ScanOptions from the user and create your own default ScanOptions with the default projection and no filter.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you can create a record batch reader from a table and I think we have examples of how to expose a record batch reader as a generator but you would need to do your own slicing (for batch size) on top of that."
