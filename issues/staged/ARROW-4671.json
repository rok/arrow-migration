This will break const-ness of MakeBuilder. `[~mrkn]` what is your use case here\r\n\r\n1. do you want to the builder to use an existing dictionary type (this is currently unsupported)?\n1. or are you only interested in providing the dictionary value type, e.g. string in your case?\n   \n   2. can be fixed quickly by adding a new `MakeDictionaryBuilder function, 1. requires a refactor of the DictionaryBuilder class."
