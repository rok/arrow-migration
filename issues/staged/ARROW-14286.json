        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14286](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14286). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSubtask for ARROW-14196.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you have a list column, where the list elements itself are nested items (eg a list of structs), selecting a subset of that list column requires something like `columns=[\"columnA.list.item.subfield\"]`. While this \"list.item\" is superfluous, since a list always contains a single child. So ideally we allow to specify this as `columns=[\"columnA.subfield\"]`. \r\n\r\nThis also avoids relying on the exact name of the list item (item vs element), for which the default differs between Parquet and Arrow.",
