Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is at least one (and I think there are actually several) places in the datasets API where we are bubbling up errors without attaching the necessary context.\u00a0 For example, in the discussion here <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10326#pullrequestreview-662095548> a call to \"DatasetFactory::Create\" (where the user incorrectly assigned a default file format of parquet) is returning \"Parquet magic bytes not found in footer\" instead of something like \"Dataset creation failed. The fragment '/2019/July/myfile.csv' did not match the expected 'parquet'' format: Parquet magic bytes not found in footer\"",
