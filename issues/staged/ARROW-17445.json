Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've been working on a blog post to showcase the new `show_exec_plan()` function, but there's a lot of information that people think would make a good addition that would be better placed in a new vignette or pkgdown article.  \r\n\r\nThere's sufficient R-related content to include here (i.e. about how `show_exec_plan()` works) that it's worth having this in the R docs and not in general docs.",
