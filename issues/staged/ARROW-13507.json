        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13507](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13507). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13199 added -fno-lto flags to the build (see also ARROW-12853). This likely is the cause of the LTO failure on CRAN: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/LTO/arrow.out so we probably need to back it out.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a CI job that tests with R built with --enable-lto, and AFAICT there is no docker image out there that has one. [I will try to get one added to wch/r-debug](https://github.com/wch/r-debug/pull/22) so that we don't have to build R from source to test this. ",
