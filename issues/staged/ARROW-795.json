Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom initial thirdparty users, it seems likely that users will link to all of these (or at least libarrow/libarrow_io) or none of them. It may be simpler for thirdparties for these core libraries to be a single link target instead of multiple.",
