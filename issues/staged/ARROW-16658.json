        "title": "[Python] Support arithmetic on arrays and scalars",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16658](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16658). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was surprised to find you can't use standard arithmetic operators on PyArrow arrays and scalars. Instead, one must use the compute functions:\r\n\r\n```Python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\narr = pa.array([1, 2, 3])\r\npc.add(arr, 2)\r\n# Doesn't work:\r\n# arr + 2\r\n# arr + pa.scalar(2)\r\n# arr + arr\r\n\r\npc.multiply(arr, 20)\r\n# Doesn't work:\r\n# 20 * arr\r\n# pa.scalar(20) * arr\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it intentional we don't support this?",

We could revisit that choice of course.\r\n\r\nNote that if we go this way, the hairy topic of relational operators (`\\_\\_eq\\_\\_`, etc.) will quickly come up.\r\n\r\n`[~jorisvandenbossche]` `[~amol-]`"

In the end we already provide those features, it's not that we would be implementing something new.\r\nI think relying on operators to manipulate arrays is a spread enough pattern in Python that it's a good idea to support it."
