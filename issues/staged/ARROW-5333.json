Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNot urgent, but I noticed that the new build option summary has lines up to 177 characters long from one of the outputs. It would be nice to fit this output into a 80-char-wide or 100-char-wide console for better readability",
