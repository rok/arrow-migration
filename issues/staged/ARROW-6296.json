Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- If we use direct setting of fields, we can avoid the extra temporary buffer and memcpy by setting bytes directly.\n   \\* We should overwrite existing vectors in consumers before returning results, to avoid the possibility of closing vectors in use (or alternatively make sure we retain the underlying buffers).\n   \\* Try to eliminate some of the state in load() by moving initialization to the constructor.",
