        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11803](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11803). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently do not read nor write the version 2 logical types. This is mainly because we do not have a mapping for it from parquet-format-rs.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, we can:\r\n- convert \"parquet::basic::LogicalType\" to \"parquet::basic::ConvertedType\"\n- implement \"parquet::basic::LogicalType\" which mirrors \"parquet_format::LogicalType\"\n- create a mapping between ConvertedType and LogicalType\n- write LogicalType to \"parquet_format::SchemaElement\" if v2 of the writer is used\n  \n  This would be a good starting point for implementing 2.6 types (UUID, NANOS precision time & timestamp).\n  Follow-up work would be:\n- parsing v2 of the schema [ARROW-11365]\n- Using v2 in the Arrow writer (mostly schema conversion)\n- Supporting nanosecond precision time & timestamp",
