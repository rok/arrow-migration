The cause is that there's no converter listed [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/csv/converter.cc#L301-L315).\r\n# To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1) First, create a CSV file like so and save it somewhere:\r\n```java\n\r\nHeader\r\n123.45\r\n```\r\n2) Run the following code on Python 2 or 3:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow.csv as pa_csv\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport io\r\n\r\ntypes = {'Header': pa.decimal128(11, 2)}\r\nconvert_options = pa_csv.ConvertOptions(column_types=types)\r\npa_csv.read_csv('/home/dargueta/Desktop/test.csv', convert_options=convert_options)\r\n```\r\nread_csv() crashes with the following exception:\r\n```java\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"pyarrow/_csv.pyx\", line 397, in pyarrow._csv.read_csv\r\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 89, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowNotImplementedError: CSV conversion to decimal(11, 2) is not supported\r\n\r\nCSV conversion to decimal(11, 2) is not supported\r\n```",
