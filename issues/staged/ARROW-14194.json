Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBrought up by `[~apitrou]`, the vertical spacing in the C++ API docs can be improved (see eg https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/datatype.html#time-related). Quick fix would be to reduce the vertical spacing within one method, so there is more spacing between methods than between paragraphs within one method.",
