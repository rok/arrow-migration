Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDremio uses Arrow Java and Gandiva extensively and could provide additional test coverage for the project. We should find a way to expose the downstream build of Dremio as an optional build so major changes can better be evaluated against downstream effects.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`[~praveenbingo]`, assigning to you for now but let's figure out who at Dremio can pick this up.",
