        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2792](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2792). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~kou]` has suggested, that we should upload tarballs for linux package builds, to include all .deb and/or .rpm packages.\r\nFor conda packages currenlty we postfix the artifacts with the arch name to avoid naming conflicts. To remain consistent we should chose one of the strategies (postifx or tarballs) and apply for each tasks.\r\n\r\nHowever tarballs would be a trivial solution to resolve naming conflicts, ensuring that a tarball contains all of the expected artifacts would require to download and extract it beforehand. This requires changes in status checks and artifact downloading / signing.\r\n\r\n`[~cpcloud]` thoughts?",
