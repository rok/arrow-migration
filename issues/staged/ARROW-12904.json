Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\narrow-rs seems unable to load Feather v2 files created by pyarrow (and pandas), while it can read Feather v2 created by itself.\r\n\r\nMore info at:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/286>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny idea what is missing in the Rust implementation (missing part of the spec?)?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nMore details: in both files, I am getting the following:\r\nReading Utf8\r\nfield_node: FieldNode { length: 7, null_count: 0 }\r\noffset buffer: Buffer { offset: 200, length: 55 }\r\noffsets: [32, 0, 407708164, 545407072, 8388608, 67108864, 134217728, 201326592]\r\nvalues buffer: Buffer { offset: 256, length: 51 }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffsets[0] != 0 indicates a problem: offsets are expected to start from zero on any array with offsets.\r\noffsets[i+1] < offsets[i+1] for some i, which indicates a problem: offsets are expected to be monotonically increasing\r\n\r\nI do not have a root cause yet, these are just observations.\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/286#issuecomment-839524898\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0In the attachment the following files can be found.\r\n\r\n``\r\n```java\n\r\ntest_pandas.feather: Original Feather file\r\ntest_arrow.feather: loading test_pandas.feather with pyarrow and saving with pyarrow: df_pa = pa.feather.read_feather('test_pandas.feather')\r\ntest_polars.feather:  Loading test_pandas.feather with pyarrow and saving with polars (only this one can be read by arrow-rs)\r\ntest_pandas_from_polars.feather: Loading test_polars.feather with polars and using the to_pandas option.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[test_feather_file.zip](test_feather_file.zip)",
