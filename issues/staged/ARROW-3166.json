Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith the codebase consolidation, we have the opportunity to remove cruft from the Parquet codebase. I believe it would be simpler and better for the ecosystem to use the Arrow IO interface classes rather than maintaining separate vitual IO interfaces exported from the `parquet::` namespace",
