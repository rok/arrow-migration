        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18262](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18262). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe new version of pygit2==1.11.0 published seems to have some issues. Some of our nightly jobs that require pygit2 are failing. As an example we have stopped receiving nightly reports. The issue is tracked on pygit2 here:\r\nhttps://github.com/libgit2/pygit2/issues/1176\r\nI can reproduce locally:\r\n```java\n\r\n -> import pygit2\r\n(Pdb) n\r\nImportError: libssl-9ad06800.so.1.1.1k: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n> /home/raulcd/code/arrow/dev/archery/archery/crossbow/core.py(45)<module>()\n```\r\nWe probably should pin pygit2 to be <1.11.0 in the meantime.",
