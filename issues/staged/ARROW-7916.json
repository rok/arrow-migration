Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf batches mmaped from disk are projected before post filtering, unreferenced columns will never be accessed (so the memory map shouldn't do I/O on them).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it'd probably be wise to explicitly document that batches yielded directly from fragments rather than from a Scanner will not be filtered or projected (so they will not match the fragment's schema and will include columns referenced by the filter even if they were not projected).",
