        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1778](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1778). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently link parquet-cpp dynamically in the `manylinux1`\u00a0wheels. This also makes us the authority on the distribution of `parquet-cpp` inside of the wheel-based ecosystem. Instead of doing this, we should statically, privately link `parquet-cpp` inside of the wheels.",
