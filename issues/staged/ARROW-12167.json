Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis may be wishful thinking but in Java there is a signal handler for SIGQUIT which dumps the equivalent of GDB's \"thread apply all bt\" to standard out (maybe err).\r\n\r\nThis is incredibly useful for debugging deadlocks.\u00a0 For example, in the R builds we may be introducing a timeout (ARROW-12143) and if the build times out during a test run we could use this utility to dump what it was trying to do.\u00a0 Otherwise I'm not sure github actions allows ptrace so the gdb route is off the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's also easy enough that users (who might be intimidated by being asked for a core file or attaching gdb) can usually handle it.\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking, I have no idea if it is possible.",
