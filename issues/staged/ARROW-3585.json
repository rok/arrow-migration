Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nReusing the Schema object from a Parquet file written with Spark with Pandas fails due to Schema mismatch.\r\n\r\nThe culprit is in the metadata part of the schema which each component fills according to it's implementation.
