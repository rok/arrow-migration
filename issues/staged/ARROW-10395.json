        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10395](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10395). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen (for example) using libarrow as installed by a system package manager, pkg-config will find it when installing the R package and will use it. But, it seems that if the install location is on the default search path, pkg-config won't return a `-L` flag, so the search for the cmake config (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/configure#L178-L179) won't find it, and we'll build without S3.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to `export ARROW_R_CXXFLAGS=-DARROW_R_WITH_S3` to hard-code the S3 flag. \r\n\r\nA proper fix might check for -L in the return of pkg-config (in `PKGCONFIG_LIBS`), and if not present, walk the search path to determine where arrow (and thus the cmake file) is. \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nld --verbose | grep SEARCH_DIR | tr -s ' ;' \\\\012 | sed -E 's@SEARCH_DIR...(.*)..$@\\1@g'\r\n```\r\n\r\nseems to give a list of dirs in the search path, so we could loop over those until the file is found, then use that later.\r\n\r\nA different solution would be to compile a test program instead of digging through cmake options.",
