        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10625](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10625). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`Future<>` is more expensive to construct than necessary. A few optimizations could be pursued:\r\n- Store the future's result in the same allocation which houses the ConcreteFutureImpl\n- Apply the small buffer optimization to FnOnce so that small continuations do not incur another heap allocation\n- Contention for the global waiter lock is unlikely to be an issue, but it'd be good to measure\n- Futures will usually have few callbacks, so a vector may be unnecessary",
