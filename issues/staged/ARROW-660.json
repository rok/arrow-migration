Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn recent refactoring around the stream and file format implementations, the ipc::RecordBatchReader class was removed, here it is in Arrow 0.1\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-0.1.0/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/adapter.h#L81\n\nsee implementation at\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-0.1.0/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/adapter.cc#L389\n\nFor shared memory IPC, it would be useful to restore this functionality, possibly as a single function rather than a class. We should also make sure this is properly documented in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/IPC.md",
