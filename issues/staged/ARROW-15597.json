        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15597](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15597). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRun `RandomArraySum` multiple times, there is a high probability that a crash of out-of-bounds memory accessing will occur. The crash is caused by the following code:\r\n```c++\n\r\nleft = _mm256_cvtepu8_epi32(_mm_set1_epi8(static_cast<uint8_t>(\r\n    reinterpret_cast<const uint16_t*>(non_nulls + i)[0] >> col.bit_offset(0)))); \n```\r\nThis code access the last bytes in the type of `uint16_t`, so\u00a0one extra byte of null_bitmap is accessed.\r\n\r\n`non_nulls` comes from the null_bitmap of an array. If the length of the array is close to or equal to a multiple of 64, then the null_bitmap lacks padding bytes after the last bytes. This code leads to a crash of out-of-bounds memory accessing.",
