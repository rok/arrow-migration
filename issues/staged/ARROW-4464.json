Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a user, I would like to be able to specify a LIMIT clause on my SQL queries.\r\n\r\nWork involved:\r\n \\* Add Limit to LogicalPlan enum\r\n \\* Write query planner code to translate SQL AST to Limit (SQL parser that we use already supports LIMIT)\r\n \\* Implement LimitRelation (look at filter.rs as a guide since it is quite similar)",

I do have some questions!\r\n\r\nI have a working branch [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/compare/master...ntrinquier:arrow-4464?expand=1), but there's a couple of things I couldn't figure out:\r\n \\* batch.num_rows() is an usize but when evaluating the limit I get a PrimitiveType. Right now I hard-coded i64 and I am not sure how to safely cast.\r\n \\* I'm evaluating the limit expression multiple times but I should only need to do that once.\r\n \\* (Also as a note to myself there's this big filter function that I copied and adapted from Filter and that needs refactoring)"
