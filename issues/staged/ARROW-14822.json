There's just quite a range of options to account for (Pandas has the ambiguous/nonexistent timestamp options, but only implements rounding; R implements truncate/round/ceiling and lets you control the start-of-week)."

However it would be nice to round to week/month/etc where the result would be \"calendar rounded\" instead of \"interval rounded\". So I'm trying to set that up, please stop me if you disagree."

But I think that's more a practical reason that this is not supported (easier to implement). But so I think it is fine to add in Arrow if we have the utilities for that (through date.h)"
