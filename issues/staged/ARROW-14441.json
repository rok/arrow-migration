        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14441](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14441). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis isn't necessarily limited to CSVs, but we should have this philosophy in our developing vignette \r\n\r\nThe general approach we've done with CSV things in the past is:\r\n(1) support the readr signature to the best extent we can, translating to the arrow parameter names internally;\r\n(2) allow someone to pass the arrow options (CsvReadOptions etc.) directly, in case they want to do things at a lower level\r\n(3) where necessary add extra args to the readr signature for features that don't exist in R but do in arrow (e.g. schema)\r\nThis is our general philosophy: present things to the R user in a way that is least surprising to them (most follows R conventions) and also provide access to all of Arrow's features (sometimes that's extra args, sometimes it's the arrow_ prefixed functions in dplyr, sometimes it's just the lower-level R6 objects and methods that more closely follow the C++ interface)",
