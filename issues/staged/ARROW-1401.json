        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1401](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1401). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis should show\n\n- the statement that failed\n- the file and line number\n\nI implemented this for CUDA failures in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/985 and I really like it. If we add glog to our toolchain we may be able to get full stack traces on failures. \n\nIt would probably increase code size to much in release builds, so it should be a DEBUG only feature. ",

We should look at the change in code size and performance (e.g. the microbenchmarks in ipc-read-write-benchmark would be a good place to look); the effects of larger code size are insidious because of the impact on the instruction cache."
