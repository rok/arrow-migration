Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nStyler keeps introducing a change where a curly bracket is moved on to a new line, which subsequently triggers the linter.\u00a0 Given that a curly bracket on its own line is within tidyverse style guidelines (see discussion here: <https://github.com/r-lib/styler/issues/438)> we should turn that linter check off.",
