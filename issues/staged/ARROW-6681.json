Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAre 'RecordBatches' being in C# being written in reverse order?\r\n\r\nI made a simple test which creates a single row per record batch of 0 to 99 and attempted to read this in R. To my surprise batch(0) in R had the value 99 not 0\r\n\r\nThis may not seem like a big deal, however when dealing with 'huge' files, its more efficient to use Record Batches / index lookup than attempting to load the entire file into memory.\r\n\r\nHaving the order consistent within the different language / API seems only to make sense - for now I can work around this by reversing the order before writing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/5475\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
