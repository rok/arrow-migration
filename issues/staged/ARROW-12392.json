Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to support the AsyncScanner we need the asynchronous streaming CSV reader back (added in ARROW-11887 but reverted later).\u00a0 However, it will either need to be implemented as a mirror API (so the sync and async implementations are side-by-side) or the async-API must be wrapped with RunInSerialExecutor when called synchronously.",
