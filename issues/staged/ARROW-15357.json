Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-14658 added support for nested field refs, but aggregations, joins, etc. cannot directly use them (you must first project, then aggregate). The node implementations resolve a field ref into a field path, but then throw away all but the first index, and so they end up referencing the wrong field (the top-level field instead of the nested one). To implement this, we should take care we don't slow down the common case of no nested field refs.",
