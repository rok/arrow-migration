        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3267](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3267). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen one knows the expected schema for its input data but has no input data for a data pipeline, it is necessary to construct an empty table as a sentinel value to pass through.\r\n\r\nThis is a small but often useful convenience function.",

            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3267?focusedCommentId=16620873) by Paul Rogers (Paul.Rogers):*\nFWIW, ARROW-3164 describes a port of a \"row set mechanism\" from Apache Drill that does exactly this. There are three relevant components:\r\n\r\n1. A fluent schema builder to define the schema.\r\n2. The schema definition itself which includes both scalar and \"complex\" types.\r\n3. A \"row set\" (vector batch) builder to build vectors from schema.\r\n\r\nDrill found that it was helpful to have additional metadata in the schema, such as expected width for VARCHAR columns, expected cardinality for arrays, and expected types for unions.\r\n\r\nThe row set builder could then optionally allocate vector buffers at the approximate desired size, which avoided the need to double vectors repeatedly as they are written.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the mechanism provides a means to write to, or read from vectors, which is beyond the scope of this particular ticket.\r\n\r\nThis ticket talks about Python, so the Java row set code is not directly applicable. Still feel free to borrow ideas. Also, perhaps we can coordinate to establish a common approach across languages."

The scope of this issue is to have a function\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\ntable = pyarrow.empty_table(schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the task is to construct the C++ data structure with a bunch of 0-length columns.

So, soon want to optimize allocation performance by providing size hints. The size hint step can be a separate bunch of data, or can be part of the schema passed to the empty_table function. (You might want to have an allocate_table function that creates the table and allocates vectors.)\r\n\r\nSounds like you're not hit these issues yet; but keep this in mind if/when you do.\r\n\u00a0"

Also the `Table` instance is not meant to be modified, i.e. it will stay empty all along the pipeline."
