Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs per [Arrow docs](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/java/install.html#installing-manually) Java nightlies are at: <https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/releases/tag/nightly-2022-03-19-0-github-java-jars>\r\n\r\nHowever file prefix changed and new url format is:\r\n<https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/releases/tag/nightly-packaging-2022-07-30-0-github-java-jars>\r\n\r\nSince it's hard to search github for old releases it would be good to change the url in the docs.",
