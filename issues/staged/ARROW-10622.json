Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`r-arrow` builds in an environment which combines MSVC and clang, invalidating assumptions made in `nameof<>()` which is used to look up R6 class names. Specifically:\r\n- MSVC prefixes \"struct \" or \"class \" to some type names, but this doesn't happen in clang+msvc\n- clang+msvc renders the signature of a function taking no arguments as \"(void)\" instead of \"()\"",
