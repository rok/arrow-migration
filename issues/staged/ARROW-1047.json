        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1047](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1047). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncc `[~julienledem]` `[~elahrvivaz]` `[~nongli]`\n\nThe ArrowWriter https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/file/ArrowWriter.java accepts a WriteableByteChannel where the stream is written\n\nIt would be useful to be able to support other kinds of message framing and transport, like GRPC or HTTP. So rather than writing a complete Arrow stream as a single contiguous byte stream, the component messages (schema, dictionaries, and record batches) would be framed as separate messages in the underlying protocol. \n\nSo if we were using ProtocolBuffers and gRPC as the underlying transport for the stream, we could encapsulate components of an Arrow stream in objects like:\n\n```Java\nmessage ArrowMessagePB {\n  required bytes serialized_data;\n}\n```\n\nIf the transport supports zero copy, that is obviously better than serializing then parsing a protocol buffer.\n\nWe should do this work in C++ as well to support more flexible stream transport.
