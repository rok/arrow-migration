Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn Python 3.7 and onwards, builtin dict is guaranteed to be insertion-ordered. So there's no need to return a OrderedDict anymore.\r\n\r\n(builtin dict is slightly smaller, faster, and can have a nicer repr output)",
