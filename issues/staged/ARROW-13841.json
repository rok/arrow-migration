Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHigh-level overview:\r\n- Possibly add diagram: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/ea221ae9-afc5-4453-8939-970e08759127/edit?shared=true&page=0_0#\n- Short description of each component\n  \n  Specific things to add:\n- when you commit to an open PR (e.g. also the automatic scripts we run that check the title etc)\n- what this workflow is about and why it exists and when runs: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/.github/workflows/cpp_cron.yml\n- what happens when we merge a PR (e.g. the dev PR)\n- basically, what triggers and when they happen, then once that's documented, it makes a lot more sense for people to know what to look at\n  \n  Generally add more content to make it easier to get started with understanding CI.\n  \n  This section is the relevant location: https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/docs/source/developers\n  \n  Potentially add something about how linx-apt-r (etc) depend on other dockerfiles\n  \n  \n",
