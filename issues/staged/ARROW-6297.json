Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, ArrowBufPointers compare by bytes in lexicographic order. Another way is to compare by unsigned integers (longs, ints, & bytes).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe second way involves additional bit operations for each iteration. However, it can compare 8 bytes at a time. So it is overall faster:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCompare by unsigned integers:\r\n\r\nArrowBufPointerBenchmarks.compareBenchmark avgt 5 65.722 \u00b1 0.381 ns/op\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCompare byte-wise:\r\nArrowBufPointerBenchmarks.compareBenchmark avgt 5 681.372 \u00b1 0.604 ns/op",
