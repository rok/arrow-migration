Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor scenarios when we need to concate vectors (like the scenario in ARROW-7048, and delta dictionary), we need a way to concat validity bits. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we have bit level API to read/write individual validity bit. However, it is not efficient , and we need a way to copy more bits at a time. ",
