        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11965](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11965). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFix the following R command.\r\n```java\n\r\nR -e 'install.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"roxygen2\", \"pkgdown\", \"covr\")); devtools::install_dev_deps()'\r\n```\r\nFound in the following section of these docs: <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/>\r\n```java\n\r\ncd ../../r\r\nR -e 'install.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"roxygen2\", \"pkgdown\", \"covr\")); devtools::install_dev_deps()'\r\nR CMD INSTALL .\r\n```\r\nHere are the errors I got:\r\n```java\n\r\nError in contrib.url(repos, type) :\r\n  trying to use CRAN without setting a mirror\r\n```\r\nSo instead I did that from an R prompt (and picked a mirror). Which mostly worked, except for this error:\r\n```java\n\r\nError in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called 'devtools'\r\n\r\nERROR: dependency \u2018systemfonts\u2019 is not available for package \u2018textshaping\u2019\r\n* removing \u2018/usr/local/Cellar/r/4.0.4/lib/R/library/textshaping\u2019\r\nERROR: dependency \u2018gert\u2019 is not available for package \u2018usethis\u2019\r\n* removing \u2018/usr/local/Cellar/r/4.0.4/lib/R/library/usethis\u2019\r\nERROR: dependencies \u2018systemfonts\u2019, \u2018textshaping\u2019 are not available for package \u2018ragg\u2019\r\n* removing \u2018/usr/local/Cellar/r/4.0.4/lib/R/library/ragg\u2019\r\nERROR: dependency \u2018usethis\u2019 is not available for package \u2018devtools\u2019\r\n* removing \u2018/usr/local/Cellar/r/4.0.4/lib/R/library/devtools\u2019\r\nERROR: dependency \u2018ragg\u2019 is not available for package \u2018pkgdown\u2019\r\n* removing \u2018/usr/local/Cellar/r/4.0.4/lib/R/library/pkgdown\u2019\r\n```\r\nWhich I ignored and just tried \"`R CMD INSTALL .`\" again, but then I got this error:\r\n```java\n\r\nERROR: dependencies 'bit64', 'tidyselect' are not available for package 'arrow'\r\n```\r\nSo then I also did this from an R prompt:\r\n```java\n\r\ninstall.packages(c(\"bit64\", \"tidyselect\"))\r\n```",
