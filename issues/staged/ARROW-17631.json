Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAllow user to provide comment in Arrow Schema from \u00a0JdbcToArrowConfig . It will be very useful metadata in real life (medium to large scale project) for documentation and maintenance topics. Apache Spark code use \"comment\" key for such metadata, so this looks like reasonable default name for metadata in Arrow schema too",
