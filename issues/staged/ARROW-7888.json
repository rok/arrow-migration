Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently using pyarrow.jvm fails with an error message ArrowType.Int object has not attribute 'isSigned'.\r\n\r\nI propose we change those functions to make use of the getters of those fields instead of relying on the private attributes inside those types.",
