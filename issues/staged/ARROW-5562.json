        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5562](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5562). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have the following csv file: (Note that `col_a`\u00a0contains a negative zero value.)\r\n```java\n\r\ncol_a,col_b\r\n0.0,0.0\r\n-0.0,0.0\n```\r\n...and process it via:\r\n```java\n\r\nfrom pyarrow import csv, parquet\r\nin_csv = 'in.csv'\r\ntable = csv.read_csv(in_csv)\r\nparquet.write_to_dataset(table, root_path='./')\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe output parquet file is then loaded into S3 and queried via AWS Athena (i.e. PrestoDB / Hive).\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny query that touches `col_a`\u00a0fails with the following error:\r\n```java\n\r\nHIVE_CANNOT_OPEN_SPLIT: Error opening Hive split {{REDACTED}} (offset=0, length=593): low must be less than or equal to high\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs a sanity check, I transformed the csv file to parquet using an AWS Glue Spark Job and I was able to query the output parquet file successfully.\r\n\r\nAs such, it appears as though the pyarrow writer is producing an invalid parquet file when a column\u00a0contains at least one instance of\u00a00.0, at least one instance of\u00a0-0.0, and no other values.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
