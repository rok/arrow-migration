Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMost of the Arrow APIs read from a parquet file one entire row group at a time.  The Parquet reader should allow us to read a single page at a time.  When scanning a dataset we often want to read in relatively small (e.g. 1M rows) sized batches to increase parallelism, decrease memory usage, and decrease latency.",
