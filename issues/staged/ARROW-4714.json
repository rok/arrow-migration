Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently if we want to read data from ORC data into Arrow Record Batch in Java runtime, we needs to first use the ORC Java reader to load data into memory then convert it to Arrow RecordBatch.\r\n\r\nHowever, since ORC Java Reader only read orc data into on heap memory, while Arrow Record only support off heap memory on Java, memory copy in unavoidable in conversion process. \u00a0In our internal benchmark, the conversion time can take up to 25% E2E latency when running tpch q1.\r\n\r\nTo workaround this overhead, a method is to enable the Java runtime directly reading data from native ORC c++ reader, which will load data directly into off heap memory and only pointer manipulation and schema ser/de would be involved in the conversion process.\u00a0",
