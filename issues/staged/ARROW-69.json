Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer comments from `[~wesmckinn]` and `[~jnadeau]` on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-64, we may want to set the \"Assignable Users\" permission to \"Anyone\". It may also be worth allowing any users to assign issues (particularly so volunteers can self-assign issues).\n\nThis may need to be done by someone with \"JIRA Administrator\" permissions: https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/managing-project-permissions-185729636.html#ManagingProjectPermissions-permission_schemes. It may require contacting or creating an issue with INFRA (or for all I know may be against some Apache policy).",
