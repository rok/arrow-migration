Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`data = np.zeros((10,8), dtype=np.uint8)`\r\n `out = pa.array(list(data))`\r\n `out.type # ListType(list<item: uint8>)`\r\n\r\n`data = np.zeros((3,4,6), dtype=np.uint8)`\r\n `out = pa.array(list(data)) # Throws error ArrowInvalid: Can only convert 1-dimensional array values`\r\n\r\nEven though it's working on 2D numpy arrays perfectly, it doesn't work on N-Dimensional numpy arrays (where N > 2). Is possible to extend the current feature for\u00a0inner elements with dimension greater than 1?",
