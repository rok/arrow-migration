Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe gdb plugin should be packaged appropriately. I'm not sure where/under which form.\r\n\r\nFor example, on Ubuntu, GDB auto-load scripts are under `/usr/share/gdb/auto-load/...`.\r\nSo, if a Arrow package installs `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libarrow.so.700.0.0`, the `gdb_arrow.py` script could be installed as `/usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libarrow.so.700.0.0-gdb.py`.\r\n\r\n(take the `realpath` of the installed DLL, prefix it with the GDB `scripts-directory` such as `/usr/share/gdb/auto-load/`, and append `-gdb.py` at the end of the filename)",
