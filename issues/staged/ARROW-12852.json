        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12852](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12852). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am trying to create a schema from a named list of data types, but can't figure out how. The manual page reads:\r\n\r\n`... named list of data types`\r\n\r\nWhen I pass a list with names to the [schema\\|#L140]] function I get an assertion error:\r\n\r\n`library(arrow)`\r\n x <- list(col1 = int8(), col2 = float32())\r\n\r\n`names( x )`\r\n [1] \"col1\" \"col2\"\r\n\r\n`schema( x )`\r\n Error: !is.null(nms <- names(.list)) is not TRUE\r\n\r\nIt seems that the internal [.fields\\|#L75]]\u00a0function is dropping the names. Maybe I misunderstood the documentation and there is another way to define the ellipsis of the `schema` function?\r\n\r\n`arrow:::.fields( x )`\r\n\r\n`[[1]]`\r\n Field\r\n col1: int8}}`[[2]]`\r\n Field\r\n col2: float\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
