        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14643](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14643). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs per ARROW-13168 we lack tzdb on Windows and so many operations on timestamp with timezone are not implemented. However, many of them could be implemented for the special case of UTC, e.g. casting timestamp[s, UTC] to string on Windows could be implemented without needing tzdb.\r\n\r\nFollow up to ARROW-14231.",
