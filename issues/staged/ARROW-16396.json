Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParse periods with hour, minute, and second components:\r\nms() hm() hms()\r\n\r\n`lubridate` make a distinction between duration and period objects.\r\n> Durations\n> \n> Durations measure the exact amount of time that occurs between two instants. This can create unexpected results in relation to clock times if a leap second, leap year, or change in daylight savings time (DST) occurs in the interval.\n> \n> Periods\n> \n> Periods measure the change in clock time that occurs between two instants. Periods provide robust predictions of clock time in the presence of leap seconds, leap years, and changes in DST.\r\n\r\nArrow does not have a class corresponding to lubridate's period class.",
