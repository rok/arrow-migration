Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis will be used in ARROW-12392/ARROW-12355 which convert the CSV reader to async. This causes the CsvScanTask to deadlock due to nested parallelism. This utility will make it possible to avoid that deadlock by using RunInSerialExecutor to read the CSV blocks.",
