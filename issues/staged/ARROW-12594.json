Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Versioning.html> there is a format version in addition to the arrow version.\u00a0 Currently, the format version has always been 1.0.0 but that could change and it would be good to expose which format version an Arrow version was built against.",
