Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt looks like this command:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nbrew bundle --file=cpp/Brewfile\r\n```\r\n\r\ntakes quite awhile to run. In this build (https://travis-ci.org/cpcloud/arrow/jobs/299219939) it took about 16 minutes to run.\r\n\r\nIs there something we can do to make this faster or use something else to install those packages?\r\n\r\ncc `[~kou]` `[~xhochy]`",
