        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8047](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8047). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe need documentation describing a migration path from ParquetDataset, at least for the basic user facing API of ParquetDataset (As I read it, that's: construction, projection, filtering, threading, for a first pass). Following this we could mark ParquetDataset as deprecated, building features needed by power users like dask and adding those to the migration document",
