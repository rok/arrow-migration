        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17924](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17924). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current documentation (https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CDataInterface.html) is not explicit about whether there are any guarantees about (im)mutability. \r\n\r\nMy assumption is that the _consumer_ of C Data Interface structs should _assume_ the data to be immutable by default (unless they would know that the producer is fine with mutating the data). But it would be good to document this.\r\n\r\n(as a reference, the DLPack Python docs mention this: https://dmlc.github.io/dlpack/latest/python_spec.html#semantics)\r\n",
