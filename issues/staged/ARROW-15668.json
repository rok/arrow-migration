Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the matrix of which integration tests to run is done on a per test basis and is written in Python.\r\n\r\nI propose that we lift this into a common configuration file (.yaml) that declares which tests each language supports, which is then harnessed during test execution to skip files that are not supported.\r\n\r\nThis allows for a better overview of which languages support what.",
