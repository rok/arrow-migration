Also, there are no standard rules across libraries and different behaviors can be observed for certain inputs. In this PR, we chose to match the rules of Python's `title()` for its simplicity. Nevertheless, we note that its behavior differs from that of R's **stringr** library (`str_to_title`) when a word begins with numbers. This was detected in ARROW-13853.\r\n```python\n\r\n# R stringr\r\n> str_to_title(\"1Foo1\") # \"1foo1\"\r\n# Python\r\n>>> \"1Foo1\".title() # \"1Foo1\"\r\n```"
