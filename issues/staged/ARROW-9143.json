        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9143). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA segfault is triggered by calling dictionary_encode on a column after slicing a Recordbatch:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nprint(pa.__version__)\r\n\r\narray = pa.array(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])\r\nbatch = pa.RecordBatch.from_arrays([array], names=['a'])\r\n\r\nbatch.column(0).dictionary_encode() ### works fine\r\n\r\nsub_batch = batch.slice(1)\r\nsub_batch.column(0).dictionary_encode() ### segfault\r\n```\r\nSlicing the underlying array and dictionary_encoding works as expected:\r\n```java\n\r\narray.slice(1).dictionary_encode()\r\n```\r\nFor what it's worth, this can be worked around by converting the sub_batch to and from a table with:\r\n```java\n\r\nhappy_sub_batch = pa.Table.from_batches([sub_batch]).to_batches()[0]\r\nhappy_sub_batch.column(0).dictionary_encode() ### works fine\r\n```",
