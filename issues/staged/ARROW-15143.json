        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15143). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe [comment describing the API of Transform method for classes that inherit from StringBinaryTransformExecBase](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_string.cc#L626) incorrectly states there is a last parameter for returning error status. Instead the Transform method indicates an error by returning a negative value.",
