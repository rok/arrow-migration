        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10396). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/7155cd5488310c15d864428252ca71dd9ebd3b48 Reworked how the parquet reader traits were implemented to be interms of a `ChunkReader` trait (for the better, in my opinion). \r\n\r\nThat commit includes two helper classes,  `SliceableCursor` and `FileSource`, which implement `ChunkReader` for a `Cursor` like thing and `File`s, respectively\r\n\r\nMy project uses the parquet SerializedFileWriter with things that look like `File` and `Cursor` and thus I would like to re-use the logic in  `SliceableCursor` and `FileSource` without having to copy/paste them. \r\n",
