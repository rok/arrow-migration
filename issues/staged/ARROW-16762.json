Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow C++ library currently lacks saturation arithmetic kernels. I do not think it is especially important to add them, but I am curious how\u00a0straightforward it might be. For example could they be implemented by extending the\u00a0`_checked`\u00a0arithmetic kernels to include an option to emit the min/max of the type when overflow is detected (in each position of the array)?",
