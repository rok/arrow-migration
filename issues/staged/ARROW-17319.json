In HPC our environment, that happens due to slurm using cgroups to constrain CPU usage.\r\n\r\nOn a linux workstation, one should be able to:\r\n1) open python as a normal user\r\n2) get the pid\r\n3) as root:\r\n```Java\n\r\ncd /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/\r\nmkdir pyarrow\r\ncd pyarrow\r\necho 0 > cpuset.mems\r\necho 1 > cpuset.cpus # sets the cgroup to only have access to cpu 1\r\necho $PID > tasks\r\n```\r\nThen, in the python enviroment:\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet\r\nexit()\r\n```\r\nWhich should trigger the crash.\r\n\r\nSadly, I couldn't track down which `aws-c-common` and `aws-c-io` are being used for the 9.0.0 py38 manylinux wheels.
