Since iteration is already special-cased in `internal::VisitSequence` this should allow a fair bit of cleanup. This is a pretty large project... I'm not sure I'll be able to get it done for 0.10.0 but I will try"

This is going to be a pretty bloody refactoring because the NumPy array conversion path  supports masks while built-in Python objects do not. This means we probably need to pass a null mask down into the general `VisitSequence` and provide lambdas for both the null and non-null cases. I will see what I can do"
