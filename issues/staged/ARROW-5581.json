Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nData sorting is an important and common feature. For this issue, we provide the basic interfaces for vector sorting. Users can implement customized sorting algorithms by extending our interfaces. In addition, we also give initial sorting implementations for both fixed-width and variable-width vectors. ",
