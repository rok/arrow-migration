Or we could define very simple wrappers (`DatumFromJSON(int64(), Scalar(\"[1]\")`) which could become C++14 user-defined literals (`DatumFromJSON(int64(), \"[1]\"_scalar`). (Though, on second thought, the literal syntax doesn't really buy us anything here so there's no point there.)"

Let's just add that and defer any other changes - just having that should simplify things somewhat already (e.g. in a type-parameterized test you can just define a `scalar(string_view)` helper)."
