Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- We should make ARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=AUTO the default and then document how to install the dependencies (such that you can) using apt/yum; that will speed up source builds\n- In the default case where they aren't downloading a binary, we could advertise \\*\\*\\* For a faster installation, set the environment variable LIBARROW_BINARY=true before installing or something. I think that wouldn't be against CRAN policy\n- We could also message more loudly in the default source build that not all features are enabled, set LIBARROW_MINIMAL=false and reinstall if you need them",
