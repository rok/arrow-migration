        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16684](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16684). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArchery seems to fail sometimes to fetch branches for some repositories. Some of the report packaging jobs (<https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/6643769198?check_suite_focus=true)> have been failing due to git errors when fetching:\r\n```java\n\r\n \u00a0 File \"/home/runner/work/crossbow/crossbow/arrow/dev/archery/archery/crossbow/cli.py\", line 238, in latest_prefix\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 queue.fetch()\r\n\u00a0 File \"/home/runner/work/crossbow/crossbow/arrow/dev/archery/archery/crossbow/core.py\", line 271, in fetch\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 self.origin.fetch([refspec])\r\n\u00a0 File \"/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.8.12/x64/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pygit2/remote.py\", line 146, in fetch\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 payload.check_error(err)\r\n\u00a0 File \"/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.8.12/x64/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pygit2/callbacks.py\", line 93, in check_error\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 check_error(error_code)\r\n\u00a0 File \"/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.8.12/x64/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pygit2/errors.py\", line 65, in check_error\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 raise GitError(message)\r\n_pygit2.GitError: SSL error: received early EOF\r\nError: Process completed with exit code 1.\n```\r\nI have seen that retrying the job can make it pass.\r\n\r\nWe should add a retry mechanism to archery to allow retry on GitErrors when fetching branches.",
