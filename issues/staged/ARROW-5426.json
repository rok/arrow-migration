Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-5403 we changed to using the googletest DLL for unit testing because of the issue reported there. However, the static CRT build only works when all libraries are statically-linked into unit test executables, including gtest.lib and arrow.lib. Using gtest.dll with static CRT does not seem to work because gtest.dll has its own statically-linked CRT",
