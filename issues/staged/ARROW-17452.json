Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent Arrow-Parquet c++ errors out on some files with error\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n\u00a0OSError: Malformed levels min: 3 max: 3 out of range. \u00a0Max Level: 2\n```\r\n\r\nThis is noticed particularly in Parquet columns with nested data structures. The source of the exception is a check which checks the min / max is respected on what the column has defined.\u00a0\r\n[https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/column_reader.cc#L177](http://example.com/)\r\n\r\nThe parquet files were created in Athena using the following query and read with arrow-parquet c++.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ncreate table struct_athena (int1 int, struct1 struct<field1: string, field2: string>)\r\nLOCATION 's3://'\u00a0\r\nTBLPROPERTIES (\r\n\u00a0 'table_type'='ICEBERG',\r\n\u00a0 'format'='parquet'\r\n);\r\ninsert into \u00a0struct_athena VALUES (1, (CAST(ROW('one', 'two') AS ROW(field1 varchar, field2 varchar))));\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe generated parquet file is attached in the JIRA.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
