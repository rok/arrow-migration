Arrow compiles fine if it's removed.\r\nIf we need to keep deprecated constraints for compatibility reasons, it will need to deprecated C4996 with pragmas directly in source code, since it's just a warning about something deprecated was found by compiler."

We should probably raise the issue in https://github.com/mapbox/variant to see if it can be fixed at the source"
