        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5898](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5898). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis issue adds a functionality to\u00a0efficiently compute\u00a0 the hash code for\u00a0a consecutive memory region. This functionality is important in practical scenarios because it helps:\r\n \\* Avoid unnecessary memory copy.\r\n\r\n \\* Avoid repeated conversions between Java objects & Arrow buffers.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince the algorithm for calculating hash code has\u00a0 significant performance implications, we need to design an interface so that different algorithms can be easily introduces as plug-ins.",
