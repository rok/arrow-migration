        "title": "[Rust][DataFusion] Implement Debug for ExecutionPlan trait",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9683](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9683). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor ARROW-9653, I was trying to debug the execution plan and I would have found it easier if there had been a way to display the execution plan to better understand and isolate the issue. This would also be nice to have as part of EXPLAIN plan functionality in ARROW-9654\r\n\r\nIn general, for debugging purposes, we would like to be able to dump out an execution plan. To do so in the idiomatic rust way, we should require that `ExecutionPlan` also implement `std::fmt::Debug`\r\n\r\nHere is an example plan for \"SELECT c1, c2, MIN(c3) FROM aggregate_test_100 GROUP BY c1, c2\"\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nphysical plan is HashAggregateExec {\r\n    group_expr: [\r\n        Column {\r\n            name: \"c1\",\r\n        },\r\n        Column {\r\n            name: \"c2\",\r\n        },\r\n    ],\r\n    aggr_expr: [\r\n        Min {\r\n            expr: Column {\r\n                name: \"c3\",\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n    ],\r\n    input: DataSourceExec {\r\n        schema: Schema {\r\n            fields: [\r\n                Field {\r\n                    name: \"c1\",\r\n                    data_type: Utf8,\r\n                    nullable: false,\r\n                    dict_id: 0,\r\n                    dict_is_ordered: false,\r\n                },\r\n                Field {\r\n                    name: \"c2\",\r\n                    data_type: UInt32,\r\n                    nullable: false,\r\n                    dict_id: 0,\r\n                    dict_is_ordered: false,\r\n                },\r\n                Field {\r\n                    name: \"c3\",\r\n                    data_type: Int8,\r\n                    nullable: false,\r\n                    dict_id: 0,\r\n                    dict_is_ordered: false,\r\n                },\r\n            ],\r\n            metadata: {},\r\n        },\r\n        partitions.len: 1,\r\n    },\r\n    schema: Schema {\r\n        fields: [\r\n            Field {\r\n                name: \"c1\",\r\n                data_type: Utf8,\r\n                nullable: true,\r\n                dict_id: 0,\r\n                dict_is_ordered: false,\r\n            },\r\n            Field {\r\n                name: \"c2\",\r\n                data_type: UInt32,\r\n                nullable: true,\r\n                dict_id: 0,\r\n                dict_is_ordered: false,\r\n            },\r\n            Field {\r\n                name: \"MIN(c3)\",\r\n                data_type: Int64,\r\n                nullable: true,\r\n                dict_id: 0,\r\n                dict_is_ordered: false,\r\n            },\r\n        ],\r\n        metadata: {},\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```",
