Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, `archery release changelog generate` will get issue titles from JIRA.\r\nThis is suboptimal as often the title of a JIRA points to a general problem, but doesn't describe the specific changes. Sometimes even, the JIRA title is misleading as the chosen solution is different as the one envisioned by the submitter.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to fetch the git commit titles and use the first line as the change summary.",
