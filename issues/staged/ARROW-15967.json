Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing code to generate exec plans we often write something like...\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nMakeExecNodeOrStop(\"write\", plan.get(), {table}, options);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA few times now a user has (possibly via copy / paste) written the wrong node (e.g. \"sink\" instead of \"write\") and when that happens we try and do a checked cast on the options (e.g. to WriteNodeOptions) and this raises an exception.  We should do a safer cast and return an invalid status with a nice message.",
