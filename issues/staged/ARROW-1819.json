Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer discussion during Arrow sync, we might be able to remove the legacy vectors if Dremio can rebase on Arrow master. \r\n\r\nThis means we will remove the legacy class templates.\r\n\r\nIt'd great to remove them before 0.8 release, but it's Ok if pushed to 0.9.",
