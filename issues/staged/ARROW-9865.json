Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHow can I do an in-place update on a specific value in a dictionary encoded column in an Arrow Table?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have searched all issues and all of the documentation that I can find, and I still can't figure out how to add a new item to a dictionary. The new item I would like to add is different than any previously added value, so it is not already in the dictionary keys. Is this possible?\u00a0\r\n\r\nI am working in the JS client, but a Python example may be enough to point me in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

You can however construct a new Arrow Vector with additional elements via the Builder classes (or related high-level `Vector.from()` convenience methods)."
