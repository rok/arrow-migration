        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13283](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13283). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt can be useful to limit the memory available to one of our Docker containers to more accurately reproduce CI conditions. docker-compose doesn't directly support this (except in 'swarm' deployment mode) but since Archery can directly invoke the docker CLI, we could support this ourselves, either by adding custom metadata into docker-compose.yml or exposing a manual CLI parameter.",
