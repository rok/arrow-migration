Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe serialize / deserialize roundtrip loses ` df.columns.name `\n\n```python\nIn [1]: import pandas as pd\n\nIn [2]: import pyarrow as pa\n\nIn [3]: df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2]], columns=pd.Index(['a', 'b'], name='col_name'))\n\nIn [4]: df.columns.name\nOut[4]: 'col_name'\n\nIn [5]: pa.deserialize_pandas(pa.serialize_pandas(df)).columns.name\n```\n\nIs this in scope for pyarrow? I suspect it would require an update to the pandas section of the Schema metadata.",

Though perhaps we can constrain the name to be a string, or coercible to a string? "
