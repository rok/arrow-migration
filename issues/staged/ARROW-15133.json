Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- ci/scripts/util_checkout.sh was used to checkout submodules because actions/checkout@v2 has removed support for that, but they have restored it since.\n- ci/scripts/util_cleanup.sh was used to free up disk space on github actions runners, because at that time it was limited to 7GB, from a recent run it looks like the linux runners now have 32GB free space so we can try to disable the cleanup step sparing almost a minute of build time",
