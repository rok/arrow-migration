Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile this operation is of very limited utility, for completness and uniformity I would like to have a min/max aggregation kernel that works for BooleanArrays. Currently we have ones for primitive value (e.g. numeric) arrays as well as strings, etc.\r\n",
