Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee eg https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/1804464537, failure looks like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n ____________ ERROR collecting tests/io/dask/dataframe/test_read.py _____________\r\ntests/io/dask/dataframe/test_read.py:185: in <module>\r\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\"col\", get_dataframe_not_nested().columns)\r\nkartothek/core/testing.py:65: in get_dataframe_not_nested\r\n    \"unicode\": pd.Series([\"\u00d6\"], dtype=np.unicode),\r\n/opt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/series.py:335: in __init__\r\n    data = sanitize_array(data, index, dtype, copy, raise_cast_failure=True)\r\n/opt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/construction.py:480: in sanitize_array\r\n    subarr = _try_cast(data, dtype, copy, raise_cast_failure)\r\n/opt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/construction.py:587: in _try_cast\r\n    maybe_cast_to_integer_array(arr, dtype)\r\n/opt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py:1723: in maybe_cast_to_integer_array\r\n    casted = np.array(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)\r\nE   ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\u00d6'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it seems that `pd.Series([\"\u00d6\"], dtype=np.unicode)` stopped working with numpy 1.20.0",

This is already reported and fixed (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18287), so I assume it will soon be in a 1.20.1 release. \r\n"
