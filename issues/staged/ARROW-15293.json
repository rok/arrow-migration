        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15293](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15293). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMove arrow-nightly CI to crossbow \u2014 currently there is [a separate repo](https://github.com/ursa-labs/arrow-r-nightly/) that builds our nightly binaries and hosts them (as well as hosts our distributed binaries, and builds nightly docs). We should move (some of) this under apache/arrow now that we can. Specifically, [the GHA that builds the binaries](https://github.com/ursa-labs/arrow-r-nightly/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-and-test-all.yml). \r\n\r\nIf we wanted to get fancy we could also use a parameterized/manually triggered GHA for our release builds.",
