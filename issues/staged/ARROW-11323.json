Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf you run a SQL query in datafusion which has predicates that produces no rows that also includes a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause, you get the following error:\r\n\r\nError of \"ArrowError(ComputeError(\"concat requires input of at least one array\"))\"\r\n\r\nHere are two test cases that show the problem: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/rust/datafusion/src/execution/context.rs#L889\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n    #[tokio::test]\r\n    async fn sort_empty() -> Result<()> {\r\n        // The predicate on this query purposely generates no results\r\n        let results =\r\n            execute(\"SELECT c1, c2 FROM test WHERE c1 > 100000 ORDER BY c1 DESC, c2 ASC\", 4).await?;\r\n        assert_eq!(results.len(), 0);\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    #[tokio::test]\r\n    async fn aggregate_empty() -> Result<()> {\r\n        // The predicate on this query purposely generates no results\r\n        let results = execute(\"SELECT SUM(c1), SUM(c2) FROM test where c1 > 100000\", 4).await?;\r\n        assert_eq!(results.len(), 0);\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```",
