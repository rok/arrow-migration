Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`array` is a function that takes an arbitrary number of columns and returns a fixed-size array with their values.\r\n\r\nThis function is notoriously difficult to implement because it receives an arbitrary number of arguments or arbitrary but common types, but it is also useful for grouping values together, e.g. to pass to a UDF.",
