Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs [discussed here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13506#pullrequestreview-1048946393) we want C++ to report invalid strptime formats to avoid having to implement this logic in multiple places. Once that is in place (if it's not yet) we should add tests for this error in R. Currently an invalid format used in R will simply return an array of NAs.",
