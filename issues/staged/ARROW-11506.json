Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\npyarrow 3.0.0 fails on install in a clean environment created using virtualenv on ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\nI ran the following code inside of a brand new environment:\r\n```java\n\r\npython3 -m pip install pyarrow\n```\r\nThis gives the following error:\r\n```java\n\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Cython'\n```\r\nSo I run\r\n```java\n\r\npython3 -m pip install Cython\r\npython3 -m pip install pyarrow\n```\r\nwhich then throws another error during the pyarrow install with the following message a the end\r\n```java\n\r\nFailed building wheel for pyarrow ... CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.10/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:137 (message):\r\n Could NOT find ArrowPython (missing: ARROW_PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR\r\n ARROW_PYTHON_LIB_DIR) (found version \"3.0.0\")\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOnce I've worked my way through this and any subsequent errors, I am able to succesfully compile my pyarrow/c++ code, but get the following Python runtime error:\r\n```java\n\r\nImportError: <redacted>: undefined symbol: _ZN5arrow2py14import_pyarrowEv\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?",

The version of pip was 9.0.1 and I upgraded it to 21.0.1. Pyarrow installed succesfully after that. Also I did have a typo in my command as you pointed out, and I will correct that momentarily.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe second issue is still there though. I have a library coded in C++ which I am trying to pass a pyarrow object into using pybind11. I can compile it without error, but I get the following error in Python when I try to import the compiled code:\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nImportError: <redacted>: undefined symbol: _ZN5arrow2py14import_pyarrowEv\r\n```"
