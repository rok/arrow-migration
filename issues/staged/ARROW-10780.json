        "title": "[R] Update known R installation issues for CentOS 7",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10780](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10780). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello, I installed arrow using\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n  Sys.setenv(ARROW_R_DEV=TRUE)\r\n  source(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/arrow/master/r/R/install-arrow.R\")\r\n  install_arrow(binary = FALSE, use_system = FALSE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't matter, but I also checked that the system parquet-devel/arrow-devel are both on version 2.0.0 (I'm on CentOS 7). I'm using R 4.0.3. However using any arrow function causes a segfault, for example:\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n> library(arrow)\r\n\r\nAttaching package: \u2018arrow\u2019\r\n\r\nThe following object is masked from \u2018package:utils\u2019:\r\n\r\n    timestamp\r\n\r\n> arrow_available()\r\n[1] TRUE\r\n> write_parquet(iris, \"~/iris4\")\r\n\r\n *** caught segfault ***\r\naddress (nil), cause 'memory not mapped'\r\n\r\nTraceback:\r\n 1: Table__from_dots(dots, schema)\r\n 2: shared_ptr_is_null(xp)\r\n 3: shared_ptr(Table, Table__from_dots(dots, schema))\r\n 4: Table$create(x)\r\n 5: write_parquet(iris, \"~/iris4\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried various installation methods (source/binary, system packages or not, even the nightly build). The only thing I've gotten to work is to revert to the 1.0.1 version of arrow. Any advice is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n",

There are some issues on CentOS 7 that we haven't quite nailed down; see https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html#known-installation-issues-1 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9776 for example. \r\n\r\nSince you ran with `ARROW_R_DEV=TRUE`, you should have some verbose compilation output on your terminal--can you please share that?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm curious, you installed with `use_system=FALSE` but also reported the versions of the Arrow system packages. What happens with `use_system=TRUE` (or omitting the argument since true is the default)?\r\n\r\nMy guess is that there's a mismatch between the compiler/version that was used to compile the system packages and that was used to compile the R package, or something like that.

Thanks for pointing to the known issues (and from there to ARROW-8586). I'm using devtoolset-8, and though I had modified my Makeconf file for CXX, CXX11, and CXX14, I had not updated CC to point to the devtoolset-8 gcc.\r\n\r\nI just tested and things appear to be working, so FWIW you might update the known issues to suggest that they need to be set consistently. For my use case I can't revert CXX back to the system compiler because then other packages (e.g., rstan) fail to compile.\r\n\r\nThanks much for your help!"
