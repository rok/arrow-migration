        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13157](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13157). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe find_substring compute function uses the MatchSubstringOptions Options class.\u00a0 However, when I try to set ignore_case to TRUE, I get the following error:\r\n```java\n\r\n Error: NotImplemented: find_substring with ignore_case\r\n```\r\nR code to replicate the error is below, though depends on a currently unmerged branch:\r\n```java\n\r\ndf <- tibble(x = c(\"Foo and Bar\", \"baz and qux and quux\"))\r\n\r\ndf %>%\r\n      Table$create() %>%\r\n      mutate(x = arrow_find_substring(x, options = list(pattern = \"b\", ignore_case = TRUE))) %>%\r\n      collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince case-insensitive search will be implemented using RE2, this is also an opportunity to add a `find_substring_regex` compute function.",

However, then you can't use the 'literal' option anymore and have to escape all regex characters in your search string. Though I see RE2 has a QuoteMeta function to do this for you, so it shouldn't be that bad. I'll probably pick this up soon unless someone else wants to do it."
