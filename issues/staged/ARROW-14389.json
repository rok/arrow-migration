        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14389](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14389). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeeing dramatic differences in Gandiva processing time during filter operations for queries with a LIKE filter on a character field with a reserved character (-,/& etc). The version with a reserved character in the string is considerably slower than a similar filter without a reserved character. For patterns like %abc% and %ab-c%, the latter wasn't being optimized to become an is_substr expression because of the regex used to identify those cases.",
