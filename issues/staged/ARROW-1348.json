Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince I don't use Windows every day, it takes me a bit of time to conduct release verification on Windows. It would be nice to make this more automated in a batch file, e.g.\n\n```Java\ndev/release/verify-release-candidate.bat %PATH_TO_RC_TARBALL%\n```",
