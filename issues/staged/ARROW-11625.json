As far as I can see, this is because the planner does an optimization step that inserts a merge for children that contain multiple partitions.\r\n```java\n\r\nmatch plan.required_child_distribution() {\r\n    Distribution::UnspecifiedDistribution => plan.with_new_children(children),\r\n    Distribution::SinglePartition => plan.with_new_children(\r\n        children\r\n            .iter()\r\n            .map(|child| {\r\n                if child.output_partitioning().partition_count() == 1 {\r\n                    child.clone()\r\n                } else {\r\n                    Arc::new(MergeExec::new(child.clone()))\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n            .collect(),\r\n    ),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\u00a0What's the reason for moving this check into planning time? How should I proceed?"
