        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13997](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13997). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe R bindings transitioned to using exec nodes for all queries. Since ARROW-13740 was merged, the performance for our queries has been slower. ARROW-13940 corrected the accidental disabling of multi threading, which recovered some of the performance, but not all of it.\r\n\r\nThe three benchmarks showing the degradation:\r\nhttps://conbench.ursa.dev/benchmarks/c6d37c1517af405dbb8ebad83eec010c/\r\nhttps://conbench.ursa.dev/benchmarks/cec58c9c21234ffbb1bab28b7fe409ef/\r\nhttps://conbench.ursa.dev/benchmarks/99c04f5ef2fe4caf868904699c2f377c/\r\n\r\nThe queries for these are defined (by name) at: https://github.com/ursacomputing/arrowbench/blob/19cb0e5dac316ae5e3c9cac4d7534fc202459fe0/R/bm-dataset-taxi-parquet.R#L27-L90\r\n\r\nFor 2 of the three, there was a large increase when ARROW-13740 was merged and plateau, and then a smaller step down when ARROW-13940 was merged, but we still haven't reverted to the pre-change mean.",
