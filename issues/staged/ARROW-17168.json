Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the C++ Cookbook has very few examples compared to the Python Cookbook, even though C++ Arrow can be used for the same tasks. Achieving parity between the cookbooks would be useful for developers to be able to use Arrow via C++ as a primary language.\r\n\r\nRequires creation of examples and some light supporting prose \u2013 Python Cookbook can likely be copied in structure and some prose to save time.",
