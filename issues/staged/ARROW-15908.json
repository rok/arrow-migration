        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15908](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15908). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi all\r\n\r\nI'm busy testing arrow flight and I'm noticing that requesting actions from C# to Python is raising the following exception.\r\n```java\n\r\nUnhandled exception. System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. (Status(StatusCode=\"Unknown\", Detail=\"a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'. Detail: Python exception: TypeError\"))\r\n\u00a0---> Grpc.Core.RpcException: Status(StatusCode=\"Unknown\", Detail=\"a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'. Detail: Python exception: TypeError\")\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0at Grpc.Net.Client.Internal.HttpContentClientStreamReader`2.MoveNextCore(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0at Apache.Arrow.Flight.Internal.StreamReader`2.MoveNext(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0--- End of inner exception stack trace ---\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Wait(Int32 millisecondsTimeout, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Wait()\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0at Test.Program.Main(String[] args) in C:\\Users\\Chris\\Test\\Program.cs:line 33\r\n \n```\r\nI've built a [C# client](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/csharp/examples/FlightClientExample) and [Python server](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/python/examples/flight) which I've obtained from the Arrow Github repo.\r\n\r\nI've trimmed down the C# client to just the following code:\r\n```java\n\r\nusing System;\r\nusing Grpc.Net.Client;\r\nusing Apache.Arrow.Flight.Client;\r\nusing Apache.Arrow.Flight;\r\n\r\nnamespace Test\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            var address = \"http://localhost:5005\";\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Connecting to: {address}\");\r\n            var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(address);\r\n            var client = new FlightClient(channel);\r\n            var shutdownAction = client.DoAction(new FlightAction(\"shutdown\")); \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     shutdownAction.ResponseStream.MoveNext(default).Wait();\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n} \n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI've noted that the original code on the github repo example uses await (which no longer seems to work) and if I leave the final line out, the do_action() method is never called server-side.",

It's because the Python server is raising an uncaught exception. That said, I can't replicate it with the Python client. Can you add a try-except to the Python side and get the full traceback?"

I did file ARROW-15909 just now because we should try to log exceptions by default in Python - else it gets confusing."
