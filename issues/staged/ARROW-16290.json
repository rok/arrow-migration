        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16290](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16290). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment ARROW-16286 prevents us from using ExecuteScalarExpression on nullary functions.  However, if we bypass constant folding, then we run into another problem.  The batch passed to the function always has length = 1.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be tied up with the logic of ExecBatchIterator that I don't quite follow entirely.  However, we should be preserving the batch length of the input to ExecuteScalarExpression and passing that to the function.",
