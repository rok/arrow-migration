Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI thought this was already deprecated in favor of `internal::MakeArray`. We should consider making this function and `internal::ArrayData` part of the public API instead. ",
