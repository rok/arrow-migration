        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4578](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4578). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `Float16Vector#toArray()` implementation currently transforms each half float into a single float, and returns a Float32Array. All the other `toArray()` implementations are zero-copy, and this deviation would break anyone expecting to give two-byte half floats to native APIs like WebGL. We should instead include `Float16Vector#toFloat32Array()` and `Float16Vector#toFloat64Array()` convenience methods that do rely on copying.",
