Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen building with docker ( <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/documentation.html#building-with-docker> ) the output goes into the `/build` directory of the container. The documentation states that the output will be available in `docs/_build/html` but for that to be true you need to mount that local directory as `/build` to get the output available to your own system, or it will remain in the container and thus won't be accessible.",

If `[~kszucs]` confirms it's safe to do so I can easily change the PR."
