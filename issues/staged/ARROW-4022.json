Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn working on ARROW-3762, I've found it's useful to be able to have functions return either `Array` or `ChunkedArray`. We might consider promoting the `arrow::compute::Datum` variant out of `arrow/compute/kernel.h` so it can be used in other places where it's helpful",
