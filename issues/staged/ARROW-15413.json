        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15413](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15413). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen scanning an IPC file the finest resolution we can read currently is a record batch.  Often we are processing relatively small slices of that batch in an iterative fashion.  This means we sometimes have to read in and hold a huge batch of memory while we slice off small pieces of it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user creates an IPC file with 1 record batch with 50 million rows and we want to process it in batches of 64K rows we have to first read the entire 50 million rows in memory and then slice off the 64K sub-batches.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to create a sub-batch reader (although this will be more complicated in the future with things like RLE columns) which can slice small pieces of the batch off the disk instead of reading the entire batch into memory first.",

For something like a string column, you would have to read the offsets first to know which slice of the data buffer to read. (Or you could always read the entire data buffer, but this presumably misses the point.)"

I suppose we could always just read those columns into memory but page out the other columns but that gets tricky to understand rather quickly.  We could also read the offsets buffer first, then read the data buffer next.  This would slow us down in some cases but it might be preferably to slow down than to run out of RAM."
