Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently there is a fallback in ScannerBuilder::Finish that ignores use_async if creating a scanner from a single fragment as I wasn't sure if that method was going to stick around.\u00a0 Given ARROW-12231 it seems likely that method will stay so we should support creating an AsyncScanner from this.",
