        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10220](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10220). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nString decoding from arrow tables is a major bottleneck in using arrow in Javascript\u2013it can take a second to decode a million rows. For utf-8 types, I'm not sure what could be done; but some memoization would help utf-8 dictionary types.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the javascript implementation decodes a utf-8 string every time you request an item from a dictionary with utf-8 data. If arrow cached the decoded strings to a native js Map, routine operations like looping over all the entries in a text column might be on the order of 10x faster.\u00a0Here's an observable notebook [benchmarking that and a couple other strategies](https://observablehq.com/@bmschmidt/faster-arrow-dictionary-unpacking).\r\n\r\nI would file a pull request, but 1) I would have to learn some typescript to do so, and 2) this idea may be undesirable because it creates new objects that will increase the memory footprint of a table, rather than just using the typed arrays.\r\n\r\nSome discussion of how the real-world issues here\u00a0affect the arquero project is [here](https://github.com/uwdata/arquero/issues/1).\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
