Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the process of building Arrow for Java on Windows, I ran into some roadblocks, which I will address either through documenting in the README.md or code changes.\r\n\r\nSo far, here's what I've got:\r\n \\* if you set Git to leave line endings alone (as LF as opposed to changing to CR-LF) checkstyle will give a spurious complaint about a file not ending in a LF\r\n \\* Made this into a new bug (ARROW-12111) ~~Java has no \"native\" flatc (flatbuffers compiler) so the Maven build gets an unofficial binary artifact; but there's no version for Windows. I can provide an overview for building it and installing the Maven artifact locally.~~",

It took me a couple days to download Visual Studio and figure out how to build flatc.\r\n\r\nThere are some instructions for it on the flatbuffer site, but the command line things didn't work for me (it's not a familiar toolchain for me) so I launched Visual Studio to build it.\r\n\r\nI noticed that for many languages (C++, Rust, JS, C#) the generated source is checked in.\r\n\r\nThere are various pros and cons to this, but I asked the dev mailing list to find out how to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf we can check in the files, then people don't have to figure out how to get flatc; on the other hand, someone would have to remember to build and check in updated files whenever the binary format changes.\r\n\r\nI looked at the Git logs and it seems like this is done by hand."
