Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should set up cargo bench so that we can start running benchmarks and tracking benchmark results between releases so we can spot performance regressions.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks should be created for the array builders, and the methods in array_ops. We can do the creation of the actual benchmarks under separate jira issues.",

Do you mean adding benchmarks to CI jobs? this could increase the runtime for these jobs though and I don't think we are doing this in other languages.\r\n"
