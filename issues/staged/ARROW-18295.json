        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18295](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18295). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[GitHub PR 14495 \\| https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14495] adds support for `struct_field` to accept string field names (as well as a mix of indices/strings). A side effect is the error produced by `FieldRef::FindOne` and by proxy `FieldRef::FindAll` does not give as good of an error as the previous `StructFieldFunctor::CheckIndex` did. \r\n\r\nSee the [GitHub discussion here for more context \\| https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14495#discussion_r1016325430]\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a similar error message given when using `FieldRef::FineOne` on a `DataType`.\r\n\r\nExample error from `StructFieldFunctor::CheckIndex`:\r\n_out-of-bounds field reference to field 4 in type struct<a: int32, b: string, c: struct<d: int64, e: double>> with 3 fields_\r\n\r\nError from `FieldRef::FindOne`:\r\n_No match for FieldRef.FieldPath(2 4) in struct<a: int32, b: string, c: struct<d: int64, e: double>>_",
