Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-8049 increased the minimum cmake version required for bundled thrift to 3.10, which is not what 16.04 ships. We removed packaging jobs in ARROW-11910 because it is EOL in April 2021, but we still have a nightly job that is failing and other related materials (Dockerfile etc.) for 16.04.",
