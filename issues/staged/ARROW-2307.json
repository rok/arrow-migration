        "title": "[Python] Unable to read arrow stream containing 0 record batches",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2307](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2307). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUsing java arrow I'm creating an arrow stream, using the stream writer.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSometimes I don't have anything to serialize, and so I\u00a0don't write any record batches. My arrow stream thus consists of just a schema message.\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n<SCHEMA>\r\n<EOS [optional]: int32>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am able to deserialize this arrow stream correctly using the java stream reader, but when reading it with python I instead hit an error\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n# ...\r\nreader = pa.open_stream(stream)\r\ndf = reader.read_all().to_pandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduces\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  File \"ipc.pxi\", line 307, in pyarrow.lib._RecordBatchReader.read_all\r\n  File \"error.pxi\", line 77, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\nArrowInvalid: Must pass at least one record batch\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. we're hitting the check in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-0.8.0/cpp/src/arrow/table.cc#L284\r\n\r\nThe workaround we're currently using is to always ensure we serialize at least one record batch, even if it's empty. However, I think it would be nice to either support a stream without record batches or explicitly disallow this and then match behaviour in java.",
