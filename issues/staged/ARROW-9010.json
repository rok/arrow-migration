Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is the first sub-work item of ARROW-8672 (\r\n[Java] Implement RecordBatch IPC buffer compression from ARROW-300). However, it does not involve any concrete compression algorithms. The purpose of this PR is to establish basic interfaces for data compression, and make changes to the IPC framework so that different compression algorithms can be plug-in smoothly. ",
