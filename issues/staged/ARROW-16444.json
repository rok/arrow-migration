Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-15639, user-defined (scalar) functions were implemented for Python. In ARROW-15841 and ARROW-15168 we developed some tooling and strategies for calling into R from non-R threads, so in theory we should be able to mirror the Python implementation (possibly with the constraint that we have to provide a way to return a `Table` instead of a `RecordBatchReader` if there are any user-defined functions, otherwise we can't guarantee the existence of an event loop to do the R evaluating?).",
