        "title": "[Rust]: StructBuilder's Drop impl leaks memory",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11488](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11488). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe StructBuilder stores two copies of the inner ArrayBuilders in two separate Vecs via some unsafe code. To avoid double-dropping the builders, the StructBuilder Drop impl uses mem::forget on one of the vectors. This avoids calling the destructor of the ArrayBuilders twice, but also leaks the memory of the Vec itself.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the double-vecs with the unsafe code is completely unnecessary since you can just call `ArrayBuilder::as_mut_any` on the `dyn ArrayBuilder` instead of having to covert to a `Box<dyn Any>`.",
