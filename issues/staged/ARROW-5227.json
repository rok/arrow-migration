        "title": "[Rust] [DataFusion] Re-implement query execution with an extensible physical query plan",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5227](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5227). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\u00a0This story (maybe it should have been an epic with hindsight) is to re-implement query execution in DataFusion using a physical plan that supports partitions and parallel execution.\r\n\r\nThis will replace the current query execution which happens directly from the logical plan.\r\n\r\nThe new physical plan is based on traits and is therefore extensible by other projects that use Arrow. For example, another project could add physical plans for distributed compute.\r\n\r\nSee design doc at <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ATZGIs8ry_kJeoTgmJjLrg6Ssb5VE7lNzWuz_4p6EWk/edit?usp=sharing> for more info",
