        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9654](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9654). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to understand what DataFusion's planner is doing, it would be helpful to have an \"EXPLAIN PLAN\" feature. All other database systems I have worked with have such a feature (e.g. see [MySql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/explain-output.html)). \r\n\r\nI have found EXPLAIN helpful for both users but also very much developers.\r\n\r\nThe feature would look something like\r\n```Java\n\r\nEXPLAIN <sql>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would then print a string with the logical plan. One way to implement this would simply be to use the debugging printout of the logical and physical plans\r\n",

This would a great addition. For now it can just show the logical plan, but eventually, I would like to see the physical plan as well."
