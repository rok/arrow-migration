Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-11843 we found that we still can't enable parallel column conversion for Parquet datasets because the Arrow Parquet reader uses OptionalParallelFor, which does a parallel wait. We should provide an async version to avoid nested parallelism.",
