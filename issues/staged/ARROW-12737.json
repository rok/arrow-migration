        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12737](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12737). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd a new exported function\u00a0`concat_arrays()`\u00a0that turns a `ChunkedArray`\u00a0into an `Array`. See the PyArrow function [`concat_arrays`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.concat_arrays.html) for examples of how this should work.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso add a new R6 method\u00a0`combine_chunks()` to the `ChunkedArray` class that works like the PyArrow [`ChunkedArray.combine_chunks`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.ChunkedArray.html#pyarrow.ChunkedArray.combine_chunks) method (but probably without the MemoryPool stuff).\r\n\r\nNote that there is an example in the \"Apache Arrow in Python and R with reticulate\" vignette (`vignettes/Python.rmd`) the premise of which is that the R package lacks a `concat_arrays` function so we should also change this if we can come up with another good example.",
