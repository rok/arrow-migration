As a minimal first interface, I would implement a function/class that takes a memory pool and a `ParquetFileReader` and then simply returns the Arrow structure. Although this hides a lot of the flexibility, this is probably the most common use case. From there on, we could add more flexibility to the arrow<->parquet library. "
