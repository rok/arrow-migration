Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAccording to [the spec](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#physical-memory-layout), every array can be dictionary-encoded, on which its values are encoded by a unique set of values.\r\n\r\nHowever, none of our arrays support this encoding and the physical memory layout of this encoding is not being fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWe have a DictionaryArray, but, AFAIK, it does not respect the physical memory layout set out by the spec.",

Do you have any more specifics of where the specs differ?\r\n\r\nThe `DictionaryArray` seems to support indexes / values according yo me understanding of the spec. I would say that the DictionaryArray type is not particularly easy to work with (as the Rust type only encodes the type of the index array, not (also) the type of the dictionary values)\r\n"
