Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello,\r\n\r\nI'm building a command line tool that can run SQL queries on text files (csv, json-line ..) . But the `CsvExec` in\u00a0datafusion can only read csv text from files currently. I have checked its inner implantation the csv reader in arrow, anything impl `Read` cound be a valid input.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nShould this feature ( read csv from stdin) come with\u00a0datafusion ? Or I just make it into my own crate.",
