Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11211#pullrequestreview-761128572\r\n\r\nARROW-14070 removes the VisualStudio 2015 job, which does not use conda packages for dependencies. It'd be useful to test with a newer compiler (existing jobs use VS2017) as well as checking that we can build with a non-conda dependency source (perhaps vcpkg)",
