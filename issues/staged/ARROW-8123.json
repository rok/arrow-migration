        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8123](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8123). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBuilding logical plans is arduous and a builder would make this nicer. Example:\r\n```java\n\r\nlet plan = LogicalPlanBuilder::new()\r\n    .scan(\r\n        \"default\",\r\n        \"employee.csv\",\r\n        &employee_schema(),\r\n        Some(vec![0, 3]),\r\n    )?\r\n    .filter(col(1).eq(&lit_str(\"CO\")))?\r\n    .project(vec![col(0)])?\r\n    .build()?; \n```\r\nNote that I am already working on this and will have a PR shortly.",
