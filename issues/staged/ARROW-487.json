Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMy first guess: The segfault occurs in `OwnedRef::~OwnedRef` with a NumPy array. This might be either the cause of NumPy trying to release garbage objects (as the array is not filled yet) or because we don't have locked the GIL during the deconstruction.",
