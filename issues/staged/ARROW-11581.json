Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently there is a port of Arrow on vcpkg [1] that is maintained by folks outside the core Arrow developer community. We should consider formalizing distribution of Arrow releases through vcpkg, in collaboration with the existing maintainers of the Arrow vcpkg port if they are interested in staying involved.\r\n\r\n[1]\u00a0https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/arrow",
