But note that I wrote the file with released versions, and only the reading with pyarrow master (so that might still be a difference, in case something goes wrong in the writing part)"

It works fine with that version, so it could be my conda environment.\r\n\r\nNext I tried to rebuild from scratch (rm-ing the build dir, including CMakeCache.txt). I found out that cmake was run from two different conda environments (mixing the two environments), so it compiled with a different version for some libraries then it used at runtime.\r\n\r\nWith a clean build dir, it doesn't happen, sorry for taking your time."
