Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed https://r-lib.github.io/rcmdcheck/reference/rcmdcheck.html#turning-off-package-checks in the rcmdcheck docs. If we set that `Config` in DESCRIPTION, we can change rcmdcheck to error on \"note\", and then we'll get earlier notice about e.g. undefined global variables.",
