        "title": "[C++] No kernel for logical operations on integer storage of boolean values",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15014](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15014). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn R, we can use integers and doubles as input to logical functions like `&`, `|`, and `!`. In Arrow, there is no kernel for non-bool storage of logical values and we get an error if we try.\r\n\r\nIn the R bindings this affects some of our translations that error if we pass numbers in. Perhaps not high priority, but ran into this when prototyping zero-copy conversion of logicals to Arrow (since they're stored as an int32 array under the hood) and spending some quality time with the behaviour of R's binary operators. A workaround from the R side is to cast to boolean in all our translations for compute functions that require a logical.\r\n\r\nA few examples:\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\nlibrary(arrow, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\nlibrary(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\n\r\nScalar$create(0L) | Scalar$create(1L)\r\n#> Error: NotImplemented: Function or_kleene has no kernel matching input types (scalar[int32], scalar[int32])\r\n#> /Users/deweydunnington/Desktop/rscratch/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/compute/function.cc:215  DispatchBest(&inputs)\r\n\r\nrecord_batch(numbers = c(0, 1, NA)) %>% \r\n  mutate(!numbers)\r\n#> Error: NotImplemented: Function invert has no kernel matching input types (array[double])\r\n#> /Users/deweydunnington/Desktop/rscratch/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/compute/exec/expression.cc:340  call.function->DispatchBest(&descrs)\r\n\r\ntibble(numbers = c(0, 1, NA)) %>% \r\n  mutate(!numbers)\r\n#> # A tibble: 3 \u00d7 2\r\n#>   numbers `!numbers`\r\n#>     <dbl> <lgl>     \r\n#> 1       0 TRUE      \r\n#> 2       1 FALSE     \r\n#> 3      NA NA\r\n```\r\n",
