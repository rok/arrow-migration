Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n1. Some dynamic_casts are not necessary because the safety is checked already.\n1. RecordBatch's column(int i) function involves atomic operation and column_data(int i) doesn't. So we prefer to use column_data()\u00a0instead if column()->data().",
