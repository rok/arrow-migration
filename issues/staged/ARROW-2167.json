        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2167](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2167). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBuilding orc_ep fails because there are a bunch of upstream warnings like not providing `override` on virtual destructor subclasses, and using `0` as the `nullptr` constant and the default `BUILD_WARNING_LEVEL` is `Production` which includes `-Wall` (all warnings as errors).\r\n\r\nI see that there are different possible options for `BUILD_WARNING_LEVEL` so it's possible for developers to deal with this issue.\r\n\r\nIt seems easier to let EPs build with whatever the default warning level is for the project rather than force our defaults on those projects.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, are we using our own CXX_FLAGS for EPs other than Orc?",

Both CHECKIN and PRODUCTION warning levels build fine now\r\n\r\nwe are using the same CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS for EPs \u2013 there are some additional suppressions for ORC. I suggest we deal with this on a case by case basis going forward"
