We have a build machine running Ubuntu\n1. Phil has a build tool <https://github.com/cpcloud/scourge> that's been setup on the build machine\n1. That tool is triggered through an airflow scheduler. Airflow (and some PyData ASVs) are bootstrapped through <https://github.com/tomaugspurger/asv-runner>. The extra step for the arrow nightlies was to add a file in ~/airflow/dags so that the scheduler picked it up."
