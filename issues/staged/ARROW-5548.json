Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn testing out the Dockerfile for building the docs, I noticed it created an asf-site/docs/latest directory at the end. Out of curiosity, I went to\u00a0<http://arrow.apache.org/docs/latest/>, and it reports a version of `0.11.1.dev473+g6ed02454`, which is not close to \"latest\".\r\n\r\nI'd like to see this \"latest\" site get updated automatically. I'm working on getting this Docker setup complete (cf.\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5497), and once that's working, it should be feasible to add a Travis-CI job to\u00a0update /docs/latest on every commit to master to apache/arrow.\u00a0\r\n\r\ncc `[~wesmckinn]`",

From the perspective of Apache Arrow, the software \"does not exist\" until it is released. It'd be easier and more manageable for a third party to host developer docs. Perhaps we (Ursa Labs affiliates) can create a \"Developer Resources\" page linked off ursalabs.org containing links to nightly package builds, nightly docs, and other resources that are non-PMC-sanctioned"
