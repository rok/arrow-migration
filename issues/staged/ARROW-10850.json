        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10850). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello,\r\n\r\nI have recently re-installed Arrow from CRAN in R 3.6.2 and it no longer can import a feather file with LZ4 compression (whereas in previous months this worked fine):\r\n```java\n\r\n> data = suppressWarnings(arrow::read_feather(\"blah.feather\"))\r\n```\r\n```\n\r\nError in ipc___feather___Reader__Read(self, columns) : Invalid: Unrecognized compression type: LZ4\n```\r\nI have attempted to install from source but continue to receive this error. According to the documentation though shouldn't the CRAN package also have LZ4 support? Is it possible that the CRAN build has lost LZ4 support? My feather file was created in pandas.\r\n\r\nIf I install version 1.0.1 I can import the data correctly:\r\n```java\n\r\ndevtools::install_version(\"arrow\", version = \"1.0.1\")\n```\r\nHappy to send over any other information that could be helpful, and apologies if I am making some mistake on my end.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nChris",
