Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee the discussion here for details:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/18201\r\n\r\nIn short we need a way to map index column names to field names in an arrow Table.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we're depending on the index columns being written at the end of the table and fixing this would allow us to read metadata written by other systems (e.g., fastparquet) that don't make this assumption.",
