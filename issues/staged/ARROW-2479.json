Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA few parts of Arrow have started spawning threads to parallelize CPU-bound tasks. They do so by launching a hard-coded number of threads, disregarding machine configuration or the fact that Arrow itself might be used from several threads at once (so hardcoding 8 threads might end up launch N \\* 8 threads if the user is calling Arrow from N threads at once...).\r\n\r\nInstead we probably want a global thread pool policy, with a singleton thread pool for CPU-bound tasks (using, by default, a number of threads equal to the machine's capacity).\r\n\r\nSee discussion in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1893>",

If we have a global thread pool, we may need a facility to reconfigure the number of threads on the fly (so that people can adapt it to their needs even though it might already be launched), so we would have to adapt that code \u2013 meaning perhaps tailor it to our style guide etc."
