Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a build error in C++ that seems related to XSIMD.\r\n\r\nAn issue was opened on XSIMD ( <https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd/issues/597>\u00a0) which now looks resolved. It's necessary to test if Arrow now builds with the new XSIMD release.\r\n\r\nAs cutting wheels for M1 currently works due to SIMD being disabled, those wheels also need to be tested from the nightlies to confirm that they work correctly on M1 systems. Otherwise we would have to defer the 6.0.0 release.",
