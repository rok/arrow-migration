        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6083](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6083). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nJdbc adapter read from `ResultSet`\u00a0looks like:\r\n\r\nwhile (rs.next()) {\r\n for (int i = 1; i <= columnCount; i++) {\r\n jdbcToFieldVector(\r\n rs,\r\n i,\r\n rs.getMetaData().getColumnType(i),\r\n rowCount,\r\n root.getVector(rsmd.getColumnName(i)),\r\n config);\r\n }\r\n rowCount++;\r\n}\r\n\r\nAnd in `jdbcToFieldVector` has lots of switch-case, that is to see, for every single value from ResultSet we have to do lots of analyzing conditions.\r\n\r\nI think we could optimize this using consumer/delegate like avro adapter.",
