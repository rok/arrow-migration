        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5036](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5036). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```bash\n\r\n1: /tmp/arrow-0.13.0.Q4czW/apache-arrow-0.13.0/cpp/src/plasma/test/serialization_tests.cc:193: Failure\r\n1: Expected equality of these values:\r\n1:   memcmp(&plasma_objects[object_ids[0]], &plasma_objects_return[0], sizeof(PlasmaObject))\r\n1:     Which is: 45\r\n1:   0\r\n1: [  FAILED  ] PlasmaSerialization.GetReply (0 ms)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe source of the problem is the random_plasma_object stack allocated object. As a fix, I propose that PlasmaObject implements the `operator==` method and drops the memcpy equality check.\r\n",
