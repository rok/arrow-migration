        "title": "[Java] Improving Arrow Vector Reading performance",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5197](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5197). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the read interface of Java Arrow Vector is quite slow because the access operation has to go through validity bit check and boundary check before it can actually load the data. Such a safety check incurs unnecessary overhead in actually computation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Arrow Vector and ArrowBuf should expose unsafe methods for advanced users to directly access underlying data without null check and boundary check.",
