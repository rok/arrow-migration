However, the way we invoke clippy means that any clippy warnings introduced in PRs do not cause a CI failure\r\n\r\nI believe the intended behavior is that we keep the arrow project \"Clippy clean\"\r\n\r\nFor example, this PR (doesn't introduce the warning), but clippy flags a warning and yet the test still apsses:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/runs/1408182529?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n    Checking arrow v3.0.0-SNAPSHOT (/Users/runner/work/arrow/arrow/rust/arrow)\r\nwarning: unneeded unit return type\r\n   --> arrow/src/buffer.rs:694:45\r\n    |\r\n694 |     pub fn resize(&mut self, new_len: usize) -> () {\r\n    |                                             ^^^^^^ help: remove the `-> ()`\r\n    |\r\n    = note: `#[warn(clippy::unused_unit)]` on by default\r\n    = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#unused_unit\r\n\r\nwarning: 1 warning emitted\r\n\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1m 11s\r\n~/work/arrow/arrow\r\n```\r\n",
