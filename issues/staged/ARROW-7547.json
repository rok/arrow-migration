Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[looking into using the datasets machinery in the current python parquet code]\r\n\r\nIn the current python API, we expose several options that influence reading the parquet file (eg `read_dictionary` to indicate to read certain BYTE_ARRAY columns directly into a dictionary type, or `memory_map`, `buffer_size`).\r\n\r\nThose could be added to `ParquetFileFormat`.",
