Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis should serve as an umbrella issue for the needed functionality to have an Apache Arrow backed string type in `pandas`. In addition to the string kernels (ARROW-555), we probably need to implement some more support functionality to efficiently the `pandas` interfaces.\r\n\r\nSome of these functions are already present in `fletcher` but a native string type in `pandas` should not have a hard dependency on `numba`.",
