        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15511](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15511). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[In _ndarray_to_array the call to NdarrayToArrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/658bec37aa5cbdd53b5e4cdc81b8ba3962e67f11/python/pyarrow/array.pxi#L82) in explicitly excluded from the GIL.\u00a0 In some code-paths Ndarray1DIndexer is instantiated which will try to do PyINC_REF and PyDdecREf on initialization and destruction.\u00a0 These code paths do not appear to acquire the GIL.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best fix is:\r\n1. Acquire GIL as part of Ndarray1DIndexer construction.\n1. Eliminate the nogil block in _ndarray_to_array\n1. Eliminate the incref and decref calls in Ndarray1DIndexer\n1. Something else?",
