Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor the most part, when Arrow builds locally it attempts to download the dependency binaries/sources that are necessary to build successfully. It is possible, however, to build Arrow in an offline mode where you manually download the sources/binaries and point the build process to them (use case: you're on a corporate network which blocks downloads from github). We should document that this process exists and walk people through how to use it. There might already be documentation for this in the CPP docs, so maybe we just need a brief description + a link, or we might do that + make the cpp docs slightly better while we're at it.\r\n\r\nRecent example of this happening (with the added fun of centos 7) is ARROW-12026",
