Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nas per\u00a0<https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:JSON>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`\"This license uses the Expat license as a base, but adds a clause mandating: \u201cThe Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.\u201d This is a restriction on usage and thus conflicts with freedom 0. The restriction might be unenforcible, but we cannot presume that. Thus, the license is nonfree.\"`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nmultiple LICENSE.txt files contain a note:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`\"To avoid the problematic JSON license in your own projects, it's sufficient to exclude the`\r\n`bin/jsonchecker/ directory, as it's the only code under the JSON license.\"`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nto see them all:\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/search?q=jsonchecker\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nbut the mentioned directory is not present in the repo (anymore?).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nplease clarify, or if appropriate, then just delete the reference to the JSON license, and with that make the project qualify for inclusion in e.g. Guix (https://issues.guix.gnu.org/51566).",

We just download RapidJSON on build time when we don't use system RapidJSON. So we don't have `bin/jsonchecker/` directory and use it. We can remove the JSON license section from LICENSE.txt.\r\n\r\nLICENSE.txt files under go/ have the RapidJSON section but go/ doesn't use RapidJSON because it's not C++ bindings. LICENSE.txt files under go/ should be updated for go/ but it's out-of-scope of this issue. We can just remove the RapidJSON section from LICENSE.txt files under go/.\r\n\r\nCould you create a pull request to remove the JSON license section from LICENSE.txt and the RpiadJSON section from LICENSE.txt files under go/?"
