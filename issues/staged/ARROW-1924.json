Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe need to revert https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1758\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the semantics for pickle=True is slightly different from just using (cloud-)pickle as the custom serializer:\r\n\r\nIf pickle=True is used, the object can be deserialized in any process, even if a deserializer for that type_id has not been registered in that process. On the other hand, if (cloud-)pickle is used as a custom serializer, the object can only be deserialized if pyarrow has the type_id registered and can call the deserializer.",
