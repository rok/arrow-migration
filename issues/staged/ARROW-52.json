Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would like to be able to publish blog posts under arrow.apache.org (see, for example, posts I've written recently like http://blog.ibis-project.org/kudu-impala-ibis/). \n\nI have a bias towards using Pelican as the publishing toolchain as posts can be written in Markdown and include IPython notebooks. GitHub pages is the easiest way to publish but this may not be compatible with apache.org, so using rsync or some other static content publishing tool would be fine too. ",
