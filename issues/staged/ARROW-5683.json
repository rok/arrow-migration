Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowup to\u00a0ARROW-3758 /\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4622>. The rtools builds of the C++ library for R Windows do not contain Snappy, which is very commonly used with Parquet files.\u00a0\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-backports/pull/6>\u00a0is an attempt to build snappy with Rtools. Assuming that can be worked out, adding it to `ci/PKGBUILD` and setting `ARROW_WITH_SNAPPY=ON` there may be enough.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOnce this works, we should remove the parquet test skip that PR#4622 added.",
