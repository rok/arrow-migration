Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs found while working on ARROW-18004: the dataset scanner and the Acero engine rely on `ExecBatch::ToRecordBatch` returning successfully when the given schema has fewer fields than the ExecBatch has columns.\r\n\r\nThis apparently allows to implicitly drop the dataset-added columns (`kAugmentedFields` in `arrow/dataset/scanner.cc`) from a scan's final result.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems wrong and brittle to do this implicitly at the `ExecBatch::ToRecordBatch` level (hiding potential errors). Instead, it should probably be done explicitly inside Acero/dataset.\r\n",
