Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm writing an array of int32 to a byte buffer using an array.TableReader and\u00a0 ipc.Writer. The array is\u00a0 [1, 2, 3 (null), 4].\r\n\r\nI then read it back from the byte buffer using an ipc.Reader.\r\n\r\nIf the chunk size of the array.TableReader is smaller than the size of the array, the null is ignored.\r\n\r\nI read back `[1, 2,3, 4]`.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug in my code or apache arrow?\r\n\r\nCode attached.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

While you're right that this is a bug in the Arrow code, it appears (from my own testing) that this bug was fixed in arrow v7.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to upgrade to arrow v7 using `go get github.com/apache/arrow/go/v7@latest` and then changing your import paths to use `v7` instead of `v6`."
