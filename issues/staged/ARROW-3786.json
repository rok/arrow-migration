I don't recall hearing about this kind of issue in Spark before.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you change your language in ASF JIRA to English at https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa ?\r\nNot that this is a full solution, but if that works, it does suggest it means changing something about how to call the JIRA API \u2013 if it's even possible."

Having a dedicated $USER-en account just for Jira API use would make this not inconvenient for non-English speakers so that their web use of Jira can remain localized. "
