        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14357](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14357). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOverlapping buffers could be detected using some kind of sorted list of ranges and then detecting and subtracting overlaps.  This could provide a more accurate size estimation when tables or record batches share the same buffers.\r\n\r\nThis should be controlled by an option as sometimes it may be important to know how much space in memory a table is occupying and somehow it is more important to instead know how much data a table represents (e.g. the amount of CPU work necessary to process a table is going to depend on the latter).",
