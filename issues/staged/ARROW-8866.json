        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8866). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimilar to the recent `Type::INTERVAL` split, having these two array types which have different memory layouts under the same `Type::type` value makes function dispatch somewhat more complicated. This issue is less critical from INTERVAL so this may not be urgent but seems like a good pre-1.0 change",
