Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nR (3.6.3) crashes when querying a dataset using the \"?arrow:: Dataset\" functionality when the following conditions are met:\r\n \\* The dataset to query contains a data-time/time column\r\n \\* An empty selection is made with dplyr::filter on the Dataset object\r\n \\* the dplyr::collection method is called. -> (at this point the crash happens)\r\n\r\nThis crash happens both when the dataset is locally defined or situated on an S3 bucket.\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal example to reproduce the bug:\r\n```java\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\n\r\n# If you remove the dataTime column no crashing occurs.\r\ndf <- tibble(\r\n\ttime = seq(5,10,length.out = 10000),\r\n\tdateTime = as_datetime(1511870400) + time # dataTime columns causes crash!\r\n)\r\nfile <- tempdir()\r\narrow::write_dataset(df, file)\r\n\r\ntestdf <- arrow::open_dataset(file) %>%\r\n# filter(time > 5 & time <6) %>% # When selecting non-empty it does not crash\r\n\tfilter(time < 5 ) %>% # select empty and it crashes!\r\n\tcollect()# it crashes when you do collect()\r\n\r\n```\r\nR crashes with the following message:\r\n \\* \r\n \\*\\* \r\n \\*\\*\\* \r\n \\*\\*\\*\\* caught segfault \\*\\*\\*\\*\r\n **address 0x8, cause 'memory not mapped'**\r\n\r\nI have included in the attachment the full R console output when running the above code.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
