Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`MultipleChunkIterator` is used to implement the verbose comparison in AssertTablesEqual and seems to assume that the arrays have identical length. If the left chunkedarray is longer, this will result in segfaulting when trying to read nonexistent chunks of the right chunkedarray.",
