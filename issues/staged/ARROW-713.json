Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `CMakeLists.txt` for `src/arrow/ipc` recently added the following 3 lines:\n\n```Java\nADD_ARROW_BENCHMARK(ipc-read-write-benchmark)\nARROW_TEST_LINK_LIBRARIES(ipc-read-write-benchmark\n  ${ARROW_IPC_TEST_LINK_LIBS})\n```\n\nThe second line should be `ARROW_BENCHMARK_LINK_LIBRARIES`. Otherwise,  attempting to build gives the following error:\n\n```Java\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:358 (target_link_libraries):\n  Cannot specify link libraries for target \"ipc-read-write-benchmark\" which\n  is not built by this project.\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\n  src/arrow/ipc/CMakeLists.txt:176 (ARROW_TEST_LINK_LIBRARIES)\n```",
