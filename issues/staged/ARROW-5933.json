Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUnion.typeIds is poorly documented and the corresponding property in UnionType is confusingly named type_codes. In particular, Layout.rst doesn't include an explanation of Union.typeIds and implies that an element of a union array's type_ids buffer is always the index of a child array.",
