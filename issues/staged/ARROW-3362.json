Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe R C++ bindings feature a number of cases where a data buffer is being accessed when it may possibly be null in the case of a 0-length array. This will cause a segfault\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/src/array.cpp#L245\r\n\r\nI suggest defining some helper functions as we have done elsewhere to assist with getting a typed offset into a buffer but passing through nullptr if the buffer object is null",
