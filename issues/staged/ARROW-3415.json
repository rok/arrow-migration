        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3415](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3415). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\n+ conda activate arrow-test\r\n\r\nCommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'.\r\nIf your shell is Bash or a Bourne variant, enable conda for the current user with\r\n\r\n    $ echo \". /tmp/arrow-0.11.0.a5PLj/apache-arrow-0.11.0/test-miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\r\n\r\nor, for all users, enable conda with\r\n\r\n    $ sudo ln -s /tmp/arrow-0.11.0.a5PLj/apache-arrow-0.11.0/test-miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh /etc/profile.d/conda.sh\r\n\r\nThe options above will permanently enable the 'conda' command, but they do NOT\r\nput conda's base (root) environment on PATH.  To do so, run\r\n\r\n    $ conda activate\r\n\r\nin your terminal, or to put the base environment on PATH permanently, run\r\n\r\n    $ echo \"conda activate\" >> ~/.bashrc\r\n\r\nPrevious to conda 4.4, the recommended way to activate conda was to modify PATH in\r\nyour ~/.bashrc file.  You should manually remove the line that looks like\r\n\r\n    export PATH=\"/tmp/arrow-0.11.0.a5PLj/apache-arrow-0.11.0/test-miniconda/bin:$PATH\"\r\n\r\n^^^ The above line should NO LONGER be in your ~/.bashrc file! ^^^\r\n```",
