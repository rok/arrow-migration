This can lead to errors that are hard to diagnose, see\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/3670>\r\n\r\nInstead, we\u00a0should\u00a0keep the store alive in these circumstances, taking up some of the remaining memory and allow the client to check if enough memory has been allocating.",
