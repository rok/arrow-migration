Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf thrift is requested via BUNBLED, thrift 0.9.1 will be downloaded instead of the requested version. This is due to FindThrift.cmake overriding THRIFT_VERSION from the locally installed thrift compiler (0.9.1. on ubuntu 18.04).",
