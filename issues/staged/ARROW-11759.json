        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11759](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11759). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt can be very useful to extract certain \"fields\" from the timestamp, such as the year, month, day, etc.\r\n\r\nSee eg https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-date-components for the ones available in pandas. \r\n\r\nUsing pandas as an example, there are the basic components of the datetime:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> ts = pd.Timestamp.now()\r\n>>> ts\r\nTimestamp('2021-02-24 10:47:54.294504')\r\n\r\n>>> ts.year\r\n2021\r\n>>> ts.month\r\n2\r\n>>> ts.day\r\n24\r\n>>> ts.hour\r\n10\r\n>>> ts.minute\r\n49\r\n>>> ts.second\r\n54\r\n>>> ts.microsecond\r\n607393\r\n>>> ts.nanosecond\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\n(only for the sub-second, this is not fully clear how to divide it in microseconds or milliseconds, etc)\r\n\r\nBut in addition also some more \"advanced\" like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> ts.dayofyear\r\n55\r\n>>> ts.dayofweek\r\n2\r\n>>> ts.week\r\n8\r\n>>> ts.isocalendar()\r\n(2021, 8, 3)\r\n```",
