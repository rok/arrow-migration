Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be useful if the nightly report would help to identify the time of the regression when a nightly build has started to fail. \r\nWe can automatize this during the report generation by filtering the crossbow branches for the task's name, like on the github UI: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/branches/all?query=test-conda-python-3.7-turbodbc-latest\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid reaching the github rate limit, we could limit this search for the last one or two weeks and mark the older issues as persistent.",
