Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-sdk-for-c-version-1-8-developer-preview/. The sdk will detect the region from EC2 metadata if present; it will also (as of 1.8 at least) let you specify a default region via environment variable. So we should make sure that we don't override it with us-east-1 if the SDK pulls a region from one of those. (Sounds like how access_key/secret_key are currently handled.)",
