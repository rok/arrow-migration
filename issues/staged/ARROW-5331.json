Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, `FlightDataStream` is expected to provide `FlightPayload` objects. This requires the user to handle IPC serialization themselves.\r\n\r\nInstead, it could provide higher-level `FlightData` objects (perhaps a simple struct containing a `FlightDescriptor` and a `RecordBatch`), letting Flight handle IPC encoding.",

I'm not sure whether we care about supporting this. `[~wesmckinn]` `[~lidavidm]`"

Of course, the use case of a record batch stream (schema, then dictionaries, then record batches) needs some special handling. "

So `RecordBatchStream` should already be sufficient in all cases where a record batches-only data stream is desired.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the question of heterogenous Flight streams. They should be handled at the IPC layer first before adapting Flight to work with them. We probably need some kind of IPC `Datum` that can represent several different kinds of data (record batch, tensor...)."
