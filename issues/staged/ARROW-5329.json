        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5329](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5329). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe MATLAB interface to Feather currently uses CMake to build MEX files. It would be convenient to be able to build the MEX file used by the MATLAB interface to Feather directly using normal MATLAB commands.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis will also provide a workaround for [MEX compilation issues](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/18391) when using older CMake versions with newer versions of MATLAB (R2018b and beyond).",
