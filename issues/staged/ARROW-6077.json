        "title": "[C++][Parquet] Build logical schema tree mapping Arrow fields to Parquet schema levels",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6077](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6077). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn several places in cpp/src/parquet/arrow, the `FromParquetSchema` function is used to construct fields using a filtered \"view\" of the Parquet schema. This is a hack caused by the lack of some kind of a \"schema tree\" which maps Parquet concepts to Arrow `Field` objects. \r\n\r\nOne manifestation of this issue is that I was unable to implement dictionary encoded subfields in cases like `list<string>`, where you want the inner field to be dictionary-encoded. \r\n\r\nPatch forthcoming",
