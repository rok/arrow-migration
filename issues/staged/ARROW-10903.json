        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10903](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10903). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nContext: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8853#discussion_r542189448 suggestion by `[~jorgecarleitao]`\r\n\r\nBasically, the goal would be to remove \r\n```Java\n\r\nimpl From<Vec<Option<Vec<u8>>>> for FixedSizeBinaryArray {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich while mostly used in tests,  panics in certain situations. \r\n\r\nGoal would be to replace that implementation with a `FromIter` implementation which is more performance, more general, and has the same ergonomics (from(vec![].into_iter()) instead of from(vec![...]) for a vector). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
