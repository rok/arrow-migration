Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA Map has child fields and the format spec only recommends that they be named \"entries\", \"key\", and \"value\" but could be named anything. Currently, integration tests for Map arrays verify the exchanged schema is equal, so the child fields are always named the same. There should be tests that use different names to verify implementations can accept this.",

The IPC side ignores the field names completely when receiving a map type, instead normalizing it (but it does seem to emit the names in the write side). The C++ MapType doesn't have any provision for custom field names (though that could be added)."
