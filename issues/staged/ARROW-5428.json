        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5428](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5428). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm looking at simplifying libparquet to use common IO interfaces rather than its own custom ones\r\n\r\nThe `parquet::BufferedInputStream` interface has an option to not read beyond a particular number of bytes. For example, if we were reading a 32MB block with 1MB buffering, then we will not consume more than 32MB from the raw InputStream. \r\n\r\nThis seems like a fairly trivial addition to `arrow::io::BufferedInputStream` to track total read bytes and do not read beyond the configured extent. We'll have to add a method like `set_read_extent`",

It sounds fine on the principle. Is it sufficient to set it at BufferedInputStream construct time, or does it need to change afterwards?"
