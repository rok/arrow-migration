Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow parquet crate depends on the parquet-format crate [1]. Parquet-format 2.6.0 was recently released and has breaking changes compared to 2.5.0.\r\n\r\nThis means that previously published Arrow Parquet/DataFusion crates are now unusable\u00a0out the box [2].\r\n\r\nWe should bring parquet-format into an Apache release process to avoid this type of issue in the future.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[1] <https://github.com/sunchao/parquet-format-rs>\r\n\r\n[2]\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6255",
