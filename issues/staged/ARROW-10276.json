        "title": "[Python] Armv7 orc and flight not supported for build. Compat error on using with spark",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10276](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10276). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm using a Arm Cortex A9 processor on the Xilinx Pynq Z2 board. People have tried to use it for the raspberry pi 3 without luck in previous posts.\r\n\r\nI figured out how to successfully build it for armv7 using the script below but cannot use orc and flight flags. People had looked into it in ARROW-8420 but I don't know if they faced these issues.\r\n\r\nI tried converting a spark dataframe to pandas using pyarrow but now it complains about a compat feature. I have attached images below\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks\r\n\r\nSpark Version: 2.4.5.\r\n\r\n\u00a0The code is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n\r\ndf_pd = df.toPandas()\r\nnpArr = df_pd.to_numpy()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error is as follows:-\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n/opt/spark/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py:2110: UserWarning: toPandas attempted Arrow optimization because 'spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled' is set to true; however, failed by the reason below:\r\n module 'pyarrow' has no attribute 'compat'\r\n Attempting non-optimization as 'spark.sql.execution.arrow.fallback.enabled' is set to true.\r\n warnings.warn(msg)\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\u00a0",
