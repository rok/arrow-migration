        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9121](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9121). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `DeleteDirContents` method in the filesystems api has a default behavior or **wiping** the whole filesystem if we give it an empty path.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt's documented as:\r\n > Like DeleteDir, but doesn\u2019t delete the directory itself. Passing an empty path (\u201c\u201d) will wipe the entire filesystem tree.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnd the corresponding code confirms that:\r\n```java\n\r\n  auto parts = SplitAbstractPath(path);\r\n  RETURN_NOT_OK(ValidateAbstractPathParts(parts));  \r\n  \r\n  if (parts.empty()) {\r\n    // Wipe filesystem\r\n    impl_->RootDir().entries.clear();\r\n    return Status::OK();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is a weird default that does not make sense. If the user wanted really to wipe his filesystem, he'd pass a `/`.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Or is it more likely that this would be a (terrible) accident?\r\n\r\nI tend to agree that \"delete everything\" is dangerous as a default.\r\n\r\nWould a compromise solution be to leave the C++ library as is and put up (more) guardrails in pyarrow, the R package, etc., where we might expect a user to type something they don't mean?"
