Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen converting a short performance-critical function to return a Result (instead of returning a Status and filling a out-parameter), I noticed a catastrophic performance regression (around 2x or 3x slower).\r\n\r\nIt seems the current Result implementation is very slow, for several reasons:\r\n- it imposes \"safety\" features even in release mode, for example on the critical path of move operators\n- the underlying mpark variant implementation is not optimized for performance-critical data structures\n",
