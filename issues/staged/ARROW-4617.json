Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, we require `double-conversion>=3.1` but distributions are all mostly on 2.1 or 3.0. We should support them \r\n\r\nNice side-effect is that `double-conversion`\u00a0is not good in updating their version number. So thus 3.0 report itself as 2.0.1 and 3.1.x as 3.0 in the CMake definitions. Thus we cannot rely on their version number reporting for detecting the version.",
