But not very sure about what this issue exactly wants. \r\n\r\nI think it requests a function like ``fn list_sort( Vec<Array>, Options ) -> Vec<Array>``, which takes every element in the same position of each array as a unit when sorting. Like performing `ORDER BY` over a table.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is wrong, thanks!"
