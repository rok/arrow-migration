Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-973, a Markdown page with the FAQ was added. When we are close to publishing a new version of the Sphinx site, it would make sense to move the FAQ to the main docs project and link from the project from page",
