Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe child field for List type has the field name \"$data$\" in most cases. In the case that there is not a known type for the List, currently the getField() method will return a subfield with name \"DEFAULT\". We should make this consistent with the rest of the cases.",
