        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13549](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13549). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nChange casting from timestamp to date/time to extract the value, instead of just truncating as we currently do (which rounds, giving incorrect answers, in some cases). This should also be a safe cast by default (unless you want to do something like cast from timestamp[ns] to time32[s] which may overflow).\r\n\r\nThis should behave like Postgres DATE/CAST(... as TIME), or Pandas Timestamp.date/Timestamp.time.",
