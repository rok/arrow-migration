Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is related to ARROW-12010, which introduces optimized group by implementation.\r\nOn s390x (big endian architecture) the code hangs in unit tests (<https://travis-ci.com/github/apache/arrow/jobs/506281680).>\r\nCurrently this implementation is disabled on big endian and the alternative, earlier, implementation is used instead, but at some point we will stop maintaining both and switch to a single implementation, which requires fixing this issue.",
