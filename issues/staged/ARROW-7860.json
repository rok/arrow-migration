Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn trying to do ARROW-7753 I realized I couldn't make a halffloat. I tried creating a float64 (as R does naturally) and casting to float16, but it's not implemented. Looking at compute/kernels/cast.cc, and the associated source in compute/kernels/generated/codegen.py, `FLOATING_TYPES = ['Float', 'Double']`. Maybe halffloat just needs to be added there? \r\n\r\nAside: searching through the code, it seems that this limitation of float types to float32 and float64 is the norm. ",
