        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9345](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9345). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRelated to ARROW-8647, see comment at https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7536#issuecomment-653124260\r\n\r\nWhen using dictionary type for the partition fields, this now creates partition expressions that also use a dictionary type. Which means that doing something like `dataset.to_table(filter=ds.field(\"part\") == \"A\")` to filter on the partition field with a plain string expression doesn't work, limiting the usability of this option (and even with the new Python scalar stuff, it would not be easy to construct the correct expression):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [9]: part = ds.HivePartitioning.discover(max_partition_dictionary_size=2)  \r\n\r\nIn [10]: dataset = ds.dataset(\"test_partitioned_filter/\", format=\"parquet\", partitioning=part)\r\n\r\nIn [11]: fragment = list(dataset.get_fragments())[0]   \r\n\r\nIn [12]: fragment.partition_expression  \r\nOut[12]: \r\n<pyarrow.dataset.Expression (part == [\r\n  \"A\",\r\n  \"B\"\r\n][0]:dictionary<values=string, indices=int32, ordered=0>)>\r\n\r\nIn [13]: dataset.to_table(filter=ds.field(\"part\") == \"A\") \r\n...\r\nArrowNotImplementedError: cast from string\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt might be an option to keep the `partition_expression` use the dictionary _value type_ instead of dictionary type? Or alternatively, as `[~fsaintjacques]` proposed, ensure that any comparison involving the dict type should also work with the \"effective\" logical type (the value type of the dict).",
