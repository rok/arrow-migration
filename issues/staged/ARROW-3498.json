Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are many flavors of IPC functions:\r\n\r\n- Read a complete IPC stream (where schema is included in the first message(s))\n- Read an IPC \"file\"\n- Read a schema only from a point in a buffer\n- Read a record batch given a known schema and the memory address of an encapsulated IPC message\n  \n  These are partly available in R now, but with names that aren't necessarily consistent. We should review each use case and normalize the API names",
