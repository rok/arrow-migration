Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is probably because there no tests for the python orc reader (sorry I never got around to that).\r\n\r\nThe error message is\r\n\r\nTypeError: Do not call RecordBatch's constructor directly, use one of the `RecordBatch.from_\\*` functions instead.\r\n\r\nand comes from these lines in the orc cython code: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/_orc.pyx#L96-L97\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what they should be replaced with in the new api.",

I will ask ASF infra to create a git repo where we can stash testing datasets since I'm against checking in binary files into mainline git if it can be avoided. Do you have applications that use this code that can be run regularly against the master branch?"

This is ok, but not optimal (really just a smoketest). I currently don't have any applications running this code, but once a way to get a few datasets for arrow is determined, writing the tests shouldn't be too difficult."

Adding a minimal solution to write files (to round-trip data like we are doing in the Parquet tests) would be the ideal solution"

The issue is the writer doesn't support nearly as many features as the reader. In particular, it can only write HIVE 0.11 format, which is rather old (2013!) and doesn't support decimals with precision/scale. It would be better than nothing though.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think using the datasets from the ORC repo, or generating our own using an external tool would be an easier way to move forward immediately."
