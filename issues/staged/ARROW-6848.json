Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRelevant discussion:\r\n\r\n<https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5807e65d865c1736b3a7a32653ca8bb405d719eb13b8a10b6fe0e904@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E>\r\n\r\nin addition to\r\n\r\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)\r\n\r\n, we also need to\r\n\r\nset(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)\r\n\r\nin order to turn off compiler-specific extensions (with GCC, it's -std=gnu++11)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to be a no-op, because Arrow builds fine with other compilers (Clang-LLVM / MSCV). But opening this bug to track any issues with flipping the switch.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
