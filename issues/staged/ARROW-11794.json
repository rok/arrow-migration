Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow IPC files are safe to load concurrently. The implementation of `ipc.FileReader.Record(i)` is not safe due to stashing the current record internally. This adds a backward-compatible function `RecordAt` that behaves like ReadAt.",
