        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11114](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11114). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\norg.apache.arrow.vector.types.pojo.Field uses asymmetric serialization and deserialization for the metadata field, causing it to fail to deserialize with the following error:\r\n```\n\r\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot deserialize instance of `java.util.ArrayList` out of START_OBJECT tokenException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot deserialize instance of `java.util.ArrayList` out of START_OBJECT token\u00a0at [Source: (File); line: 10, column: 20] (through reference chain: org.apache.arrow.vector.types.pojo.Schema[\"fields\"]->java.util.ArrayList[0]->org.apache.arrow.vector.types.pojo.Field[\"metadata\"]) \n```\r\nThis is because the class [serializes metadata](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/dfef236f7587e4168ac1e07bd09e42d9373beb70/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/types/pojo/Field.java#L274) as `Map<String, String>` but [expects to deserialize it](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/dfef236f7587e4168ac1e07bd09e42d9373beb70/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/types/pojo/Field.java#L87) as `List<Map<String, String>>`.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMCVE:\u00a0<https://gist.github.com/nbruno/983cb7faf41dc20a0810ae80fe33562d>",
