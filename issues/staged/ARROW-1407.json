        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1407). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDictionaries seem to only be able to hold 4096 indices, meaning only vectors with 4096 values or less can be turned into dictionaries. The image attached is a stack trace of what happens when try to encode a dictionary with a vector containing 4097 strings, and a dictionary containing two distinct values. \n\nBasically the error can be traced to line 95 of DictionaryEncoder.java (`setter.invoke(mutator, i, encoded);`). It seems that the indices array which hold the encoded values is allocated on line 84 as `indices.allocateNew()` and it seems that `allocateNew()` only allocates 4096 bytes of data initially. The code runs if there are 4096 rows of data or less. Anymore and the same error is given.",

If you don't mind mapping your dictionary values yourself, you can do something like:\n\n```java\nNullableIntVector vector = new FieldType(true, MinorType.INT.getType, dictionaryEncoding).createNewSingleVector(name, allocator, callBack);\nvector.getMutator().setSafe(i, j);\n```"
