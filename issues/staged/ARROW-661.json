        "title": "[C++] Add a Flatbuffer metadata type that supports array data over 2^31 - 1 elements",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-661](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-661). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUsers of Arrow C++ have reported needing to store large arrays using our shared memory IPC machinery. While data over 2^31 - 1 elements is \"out of spec\" as far as what it means to \"implement Arrow\", it would be useful to have a \"LargeRecordBatch\" type that permits storing large arrays. Other Arrow implementations in general will not need to support reading and writing this data \u2013 this is closely related to the tensor discussion in ARROW-550.\n\n```Java\nstruct LargeFieldNode {\n  length: long;\n  null_count: long;\n}\n\ntable LargeRecordBatch {\n  length: long;\n  nodes: [LargeFieldNode];\n  buffers: [Buffer];\n}\n```\n\nAn initial implementation of this will be marked experimental so that we can get the code into the hands of users (like the Ray project https://github.com/ray-project/ray) in case there's some ongoing discussion to be had about handling very large vectors/arrays.\n\nReading and writing this metadata should be achievable without a huge amount of code duplication, I will see what I can do.
