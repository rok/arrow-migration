Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should add the ability to override hostname checks, so you can connect to localhost over TLS but still verify that the certificate is for some other domain.\r\n\r\nExample: when deploying on Kubernetes with headless services, clients connect directly to backend services and do load balancing themselves. Thus all instances of an application must present a certificate for the same hostname. To do health checks in such an environment, you can't connect to the TLS hostname (which may resolve to a different instance); you need to connect to localhost, and override the hostname check.",
