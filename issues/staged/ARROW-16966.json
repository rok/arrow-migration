Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAcero will never have 100% Substrait conformance.  To begin with there will be a number of features that we simply have not yet implemented.  In the future there will likely still be some features that we never implement (e.g. Acero is likely to be a rather simple producer and will reject most \"plan shorthand\").\r\n\r\nIn the future we will hopefully have a way of expressing this programmatically.  However, this hasn't been figured out by Substrait yet.  In the meantime we should clearly document which parts of Substrait we do and do not support.",
