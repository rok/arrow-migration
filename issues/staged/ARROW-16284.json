        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16284](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16284). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPreviously we used specific universal2 configurations for vcpkg to build the dependencies containing symbols for both architectures. This approach proved to be fragile to vcpkg changes making it hard to upgrade the vcpkg version. As an example https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12893 bumps the vcpkg version where absl has stopped compiling for two CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES, it has been already fixed in absl's upstream but that hasn't been released yet.\r\n\r\nThe new approach uses multibuild's delocate to build the wheels for both arm64 and amd64 separately and fuse them in an upcoming step to a universal2 wheel (using `lipo` under the hood).",
