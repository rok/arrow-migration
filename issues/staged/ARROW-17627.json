Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/go/parquet/pqarrow/file_writer.go#L75](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/go/parquet/pqarrow/file_writer.go#L75,)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRight now the only way to pass in KV metadata is to enable StoreSchema and pass it as part of the schema. In otherwise we can't pass through metadata without also store ARROW:schema\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI suggest change it to the following\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```go\n\r\n\tmeta := make(metadata.KeyValueMetadata, 0)\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < arrschema.Metadata().Len(); i++ {\r\n\t\tmeta.Append(arrschema.Metadata().Keys()[i], arrschema.Metadata().Values()[i])\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif arrprops.storeSchema {\r\n\r\n\t\tserializedSchema := flight.SerializeSchema(arrschema, props.Allocator())\r\n\t\tmeta.Append(\"ARROW:schema\", base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(serializedSchema))\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",

This looks solid to me, would you be interested in making a PR for it? (and adding a test in the PR?)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'll try to get around to adding this when I have a chance."
