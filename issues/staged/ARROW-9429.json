Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently one needs to construct a `pandas.Series`\u00a0and call `values`\u00a0to get a numpy array as a result of `ChunkedArray`. We should provide a simpler `to_numpy` function that doesn't construct the `pandas.Series` overhead.",
