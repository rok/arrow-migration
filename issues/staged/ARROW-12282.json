Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-11754 added a `compute()` method which calls `collect(as_data_frame = FALSE)`. This was a clean and simple way to add `compute()`, but it would be more logical if `collect()` instead called `compute()`, or if both called an internal function that forced computation of the lazy ops. But this is complicated by the need to call `restore_dplyr_features()` in both `compute()` and `collect()`\u00a0and muddied by some uncertainty about where exactly\u00a0`ensure_group_vars()`\u00a0and `ensure_arrange_vars()`\u00a0should be called. Take a closer look at this later date and consider whether to refactor it.",
