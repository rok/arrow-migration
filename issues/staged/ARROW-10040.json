Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have limitations on the boolean kernels, where we can't apply the kernels on buffers whose offsets aren't a multiple of 8. This has the potential of preventing users from applying some computations on arrays whose offsets aren't divisible by 8.\r\n\r\nWe could create methods on Buffer that allow slicing buffers and copying them into aligned buffers.\r\n\r\nAn idea would be Buffer::slice(&self, offset: usize, len: usize) -> Buffer;",
