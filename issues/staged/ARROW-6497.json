        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6497](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6497). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI added a build/deploy script to arrow-site that would enable automatically publishing to asf-site when there is a commit to the master branch. However, ASF won't let us add a deploy key to enable this publishing (INFRA-18924). \r\n\r\nI have a workaround that's not automatic but as close as we can get. On commits to apache/arrow-site's master branch, Travis builds the site and pushes it to a fork of arrow-site (where there is no restriction on deploy keys), and then it makes a PR from there back to the asf-site branch of apache/arrow-site using [hub](https://hub.github.com/hub-pull-request.1.html). So it's \"semiautomatic\": the asf-site PR is made automatically, but a committer will need to merge it. ",
