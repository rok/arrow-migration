        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16517](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16517). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's definitely an edge case, but preserving the row-count on zero-column tables/record batches is helpful when programming on those objects (I ran into this when working with GeoParquet tables, where I separate the geometry and non-geometry columns and then recombine. The functionality is there but it looks like it's not implemented for the data.frame case.\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\narrow::as_arrow_table(tibble::tibble(.rows = 5))\r\n#> Table\r\n#> 0 rows x 0 columns\r\narrow::record_batch(tibble::tibble(.rows = 5))\r\n#> RecordBatch\r\n#> 0 rows x 0 columns\r\n\r\n# workaround\r\narrow::arrow_table(x = 1:5)[integer()]\r\n#> Table\r\n#> 5 rows x 0 columns\r\n```\r\n",
