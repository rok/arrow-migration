Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee comments in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1971> for background on this but the summary is that Buffer should just deal with untyped memory e.g. `\\* const u8` and all type-handling should be moved to the Array layer e.g. `BufferArray<T>`.\r\n\r\nThis would be more consistent with the other implementations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
