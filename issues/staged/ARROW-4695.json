        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4695](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4695). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExample build: https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/498967250\r\n\r\nJS tests sometimes fail with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n> apache-arrow@ test /home/travis/build/apache/arrow/js\r\n> NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 gulp test\r\n[22:14:01] Using gulpfile ~/build/apache/arrow/js/gulpfile.js\r\n[22:14:01] Starting 'test'...\r\n[22:14:01] Starting 'test:ts'...\r\n[22:14:49] Finished 'test:ts' after 47 s\r\n[22:14:49] Starting 'test:src'...\r\n[22:15:27] Finished 'test:src' after 38 s\r\n[22:15:27] Starting 'test:apache-arrow'...\r\nNo output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.\r\nCheck the details on how to adjust your build configuration on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received\r\nThe build has been terminated\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought maybe we were just running up against some time limit, but that particular build was terminated at 22:25:27, exactly ten minutes after the last output, at 22:15:27. So it does seem like the build is somehow stalling.\r\n",
