Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe R language was designed to perform \"Columnar in memory analytics\". R / Arrow bindings would be useful for:\n\n- better compatibility between R and other languages / big data systems\n- chunk-based data parallelism\n- portable and efficient IO via Parquet\n\nR has a C++ interface so the natural way to write these bindings is to leverage Arrow's C++ library as much as possible.\nFeather provides a starting point: <https://github.com/wesm/feather/tree/master/R>.\n\nThis can serve as an umbrella JIRA for work on R related tasks.",
