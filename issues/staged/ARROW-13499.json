        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13499](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13499). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\n  expect_dplyr_equal(\r\n    input %>%\r\n      mutate(has_words = nchar(verses) < 0) %>%\r\n      group_by(some_grouping) %>%\r\n      summarize(all(has_words)) %>%\r\n      arrange(some_grouping) %>%\r\n      collect(),\r\n    tbl\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nworks, but if you define the expression inline, it doesn't:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  expect_dplyr_equal(\r\n    input %>%\r\n      group_by(some_grouping) %>%\r\n      summarize(has_words = all(nchar(verses) < 0)) %>%\r\n      arrange(some_grouping) %>%\r\n      collect(),\r\n    tbl\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error you get I think means that `base::nchar` is being called. I'm not sure if this is a general issue with our nse_funcs calling other nse_funcs, or if this is about the way the aggregation function environment is constructed separately, but it's not good.",
