        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2138](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2138). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNot sure this is desirable, since `util/logging.h` was taken from glog, but the various debug checks current `std::exit(1)` on failure. This is a clean exit (though with an error code) and therefore doesn't trigger the usual debugging tools such as gdb or Python's faulthandler. By replacing it with something like `std::abort()` the exit would be recognized as a process crash.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
