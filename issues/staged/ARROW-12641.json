Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSometimes, a worker thread must identify its thread id within a ThreadPool (for example, to support safe concurrent access to per-thread state). We could use `std::this_thread::get_id()` for this, but this is less convenient for indexing into a container of per-thread state.",
