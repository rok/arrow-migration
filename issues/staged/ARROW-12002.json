Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis properly affects how the CSV is parsed and in turn the schema and data, so it belongs in ParseOptions. This means it can also be configured in Datasets.\r\n\r\nFor now, we'll duplicate the field and deprecate the original spot.",
