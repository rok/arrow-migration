The macOS binaries on CRAN for 4.0.0 are (unintentionally) limited in features. Two workarounds for today (while we work on getting a trivial release up to CRAN to trigger rebuilding the binaries):\r\n\r\n- `install.packages(\"arrow\", type = \"source\")`\n- Or install a nightly build: `install.packages(\"arrow\", repos = \"https://arrow-r-nightly.s3.amazonaws.com\")`"
