        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1785](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1785). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBased on the discussions on the mailing list, we should remove the VectorLayout metadata from the Flatbuffers spec for 0.8.0 since we are already breaking the metadata. We should instead make the buffer layouts an immutable part of the format specification so there is no ambiguity about what buffers accompany each type of field in an Arrow payload\r\n\r\nsee also ARROW-1693",
