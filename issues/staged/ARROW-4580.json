        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4580](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4580). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now `IntVector.from()` and `FloatVector.from()` expect the data is already in typed-array form. But if we know the desired Vector type before hand (e.g. if `Int32Vector.from()` is called), we can accept any JS iterable of the values.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, we should ensure `Float16Vector.from()` properly clamps incoming f32/f64 values to u16s, in case the source is a vanilla 64-bit JS float.",
