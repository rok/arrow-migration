        "title": "[C++][Flight] Running Arrow Flight benchmark on two hosts doesn't work",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7200](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7200). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was trying to evaluate the performance of Apache Arrow Flight on two hosts (one as the client and the other one as the server), using [the official benchmark\\|[https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/flight/flight_benchmark.cc]].\r\n\r\nFlags I used to build the project were:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n-DARROW_FLIGHT=ON\r\n-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\r\n-DARROW_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe branch I used was\u00a0maint-0.15.x since there was a build error on the master branch. _(The build error on master only existed in the environment where I set up two hosts: AWS. On my local environment (macOS) the build was successful on the master branch. I don't think this build error is relevant to the issue since there is no difference in the cpp source code.)_\r\n\r\nOn the host acting as the server, I ran\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n./arrow-flight-perf-server\n```\r\nOn the host acting as the client, I ran\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n./arrow-flight-benchmark --server_host ip-172-31-11-18\n```\r\nIt gives the following error: \r\n```java\n\r\nFailed with error: << IOError: gRPC returned unavailable error, with message: Connect Failed. Detail: Unavailable\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0If I ran\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n./arrow-flight-benchmark --server_host ip-172-31-11-17\n```\r\nthe error will be different:\r\n```java\n\r\nIOError: Server was not available after 10 attempts\n```\r\nThis is understandable since this host doesn't exist at all.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that Flight is able to find the existing host (ip-172-31-11-18), but the communication somehow didn't succeed.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark works fine if I run it with the localhost, either by not specifying the server_host flag or running the server in another process on the same host.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the problem is in the environment or in the code itself. Could someone please give me some hint on how to resolve the problem?",
