        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12008](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12008). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs far as I can tell from reading configure + nixlibs.sh, if one tries to use {LIBARROW_BINARY=true}} on a source checkout there really isn't a binary to be found to install. The installation process does mention that a binary isn't found + it will build from source. \r\n\r\nI don't know that we need to support installing a binary from a development branch (afterall, it's entirely possible libarrow would no longer be compatible with the r package) but I think we should fail a little bit more loudly (or express that the binary install will not be attempted because it looks like one is building from a source checkout (possibly detected by seeing if the version is ~x.x.x.9000)).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could add date-guessing and attempt to download the nightly libarrow corresponding to that.",
