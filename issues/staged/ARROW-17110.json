        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17110](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17110). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe upcoming abseil release has dropped support for C++11, so {_}eventually{_}, arrow will have to follow. More details [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/abseil-cpp-feedstock/issues/37).\r\n\r\nRelatedly, when I [tried](https://github.com/conda-forge/abseil-cpp-feedstock/pull/25) to switch abseil to a newer C++ version on windows, things apparently broke in arrow CI. This is because the ABI of abseil is sensitive to the C++ standard that's used to compile, and google only supports a homogeneous version to compile all artefacts in a stack. This creates some friction with conda-forge (where the compilers are generally much newer than what arrow might be willing to impose). For now, things seems to have worked out with arrow [specifying](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/897a4c0ce73c3fe07872beee2c1d2128e44f6dd4/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L121-L124) C\\+\\11 while conda-forge moved to C\\\\+17 - at least on unix, but windows was not so lucky.\r\n\r\nPerhaps people would therefore also be interested in collaborating (or at least commenting on) this [issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/abseil-cpp-feedstock/issues/29), which should permit more flexibility by being able to opt into given standard versions also from conda-forge.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nIt was voted on the dev ML to move to C++17:\r\n- vote announcement:\n  https://lists.apache.org/thread/h9v83rwdl015z2j6s8zwdr1qp4svb5j8\n- vote result:\n  https://lists.apache.org/thread/dod96gbqtfz7pf096vhlczq6f5hv81z8",

I tried looking but couldn't find anything. I think it'd be a good idea to define some sort of support policy (note, we did this in scipy over the last year or so, allowing us to move from 4.8 to 6.x and [now](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/16589) to 8.x).\r\n\r\n> And even then I think C++14 will be the highest attainable version\r\n\r\nBarring some progress on the lower bounds for compilers, you'll then be limited from upgrading abseil beyond 20220623.0 (and that's already working more or less by accident since 20211102 on unix is compiled with C\\+\\17 in c-f. Unless we introduce multiple builds per CXX version in conda-forge, this problem will only get worse, because once vc142 becomes the minimum toolchain in the not too distant future, c-f can move to C\\\\+17 also on windows globally)."

It comes from CentOS 7, where it is the default compiler. We do happen to get a number of bug reports from R users on CentOS 7, though.\r\n\r\nR 3.6 on Windows used an odd gcc 4.9 mingw compiler, and that's the main source of \"R requires an old compiler\". But we already disable many features on R < 4.0 on Windows, and conditionally disabling more is not a problem. (GCS filesystem support, which uses abseil, is one of those already.) We could drop support for R 3.6 now, but since we can just disable features on the build, we haven't been forced to do so yet.\r\n\r\nCRAN checks are now all running gcc 8 or newer: https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html\r\n\r\nWe have CI that builds arrow on C\\+\\17 (and maybe also 14?). I think Homebrew also bumped up building arrow with C\\\\17 to match abseil (or maybe that's still in the copy of the formula we test in apache/arrow). We also have an open PR to add Azure Blob Storage, which will require C\\\\14: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12914/files#r899724290. So maybe the solution for the abseil issue is to require the newer C\\\\+ standard if using abseil built with it?\r\n\r\n"

Because it seems that we can mix a binary built with the default g\\\\+ and a binary built with the debtoolset's g\\\\ in the same process on CentOS 7.\r\n\r\nI think that the following 2 cases:\r\n\r\n1. Build Arrow with the devtoolset's g\\\\ and use the built Arrow as a library for a C++ program that is built with the default g\\\\.\r\n2. `dlopen()` Arrow built with the devtoolset's g\\\\ and a library built with the default g\\\\ in the same process.\r\n\r\n1. is meaningless for us as Antoine said. Sorry.\r\n\r\n2. may be happen with Ruby. For example, `ruby -r red-arrow -r unf_ext -e 'nil'`. (`unf_ext` is one of Ruby libraries that use C++.)\r\n\r\nIt seems that 2. works too. So I think that we can switch to C\\+\\14 or C\\\\+17."

The situations where we hear about old compilers and the arrow R package are primarily from large organizations that use Windows and whose IT departments are slow to upgrade anything (based on my brief experience in government, R 3.6 on Windows will still be around for a long time to come) and people using compute clusters that use centos7. Some of those environments prevent installing binaries from anywhere but CRAN, which may make backporting bugfixes difficult.\r\n\r\nI'm not qualified to comment on moving Arrow's C++ code to anything for maintainability purposes...I just wanted to add some context to \"we haven't done this yet because R\": there really are users out there who want to use Arrow and may have to look elsewhere."

The parts of the package we're actively developing-~~datasets/acero~~-are already disabled in the old Windows builds because of threading issues. Windows R 3.6 users may still use arrow to read parquet and feather files, but for that they can use an older version of the arrow package just fine."
