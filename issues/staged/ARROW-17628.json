        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17628](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17628). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am trying to build the arrow-cookbooks for Java with the latest version published of the Nightlies. Currently in order to use the latest nightly we have to specify the latest version, i.e: 10.0.0.dev234\r\n\r\nIn order to find out which one is the latest version published we have to parse the HTML on <https://nightlies.apache.org/arrow/java/org/apache/arrow/arrow-c-data/> (or other packages) and find out which one is the latest as discussed on the documentation:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/java/building.rst#installing-from-apache-nightlies>\r\n\r\nI propose we publish the latest nightly both with its unique version (i.e: 10.0.0.dev234) and with 10.0.0-SNAPSHOT to make it easier for upstream automation.\r\n\r\nAnother proposal would be to add a VERSIONS metatada file with the latest published version but from some investigation on other Java projects publishing nightlies as SNAPSHOT seems to be the most common use case.",
