Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe google style guide describes best practices for source code comments including for [TODO comments](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#TODO_Comments). Nevertheless, Arrow C++ code contains comments with custom tags (**TODO**, **NOTE**, **N.B.**, **XXX**) which are used with varying styles and do not have an explicit guideline on their use/meaning.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to establish guidelines for allowed custom tags (if any) and their use case.",
