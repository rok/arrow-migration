An example can be found in `JdbcToArrowVectorIteratorTest` of the PR (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8597/files#diff-7ba75c47a9fad67647ed7ce4ee6da10464ee8d0acc72de3dd2222092a33323d0). \r\n\r\nIn particular, to support customized mapping, we need to \r\n1. Define the mapping from JDBC types to Arrow types.\r\n2. Create a JdbcToArrowConfig object with the mapping.\r\n3. Create a ArrowVectorIterator object with the config object above. \r\n4. Use the iterator above to consume data. "
