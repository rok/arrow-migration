Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment what happens when we serialize an OrderedDict and then deserialize it, it will become a normal dict! This can be reproduced with\n\n```Java\nimport pyarrow\nimport collections\nd = collections.OrderedDict([(\"hello\", 1), (\"world\", 2)])\ntype(pyarrow.serialize(d).deserialize())\n```\n\nwhich will return \"dict\".
