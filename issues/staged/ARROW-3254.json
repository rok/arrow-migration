        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3254](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3254). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently there is a 1-1 correspondence between a .cc file containing unit tests to a test executable. There's good reasons (like readability, code organization) to split up a large test suite among many files. But there are downsides:\r\n\r\n- Linking test executables is slow, especially on Windows\n- Test executables take up quite a bit of space (the debug/ directory on Linux after a full build is ~1GB)\n  \n  I suggest enabling ADD_ARROW_TEST to accept a list of files which will be build together into a single test. This will allow us to combine a number of our unit tests and save time and space",
