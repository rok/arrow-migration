        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18011](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18011). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14033> uses several heuristics to determine the default Git branch name for the upstream apache/arrow project. When the heuristics fail to detect the default branch name, the strategy used in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14033> currently falls back to using the hard-coded branch name \"master\".\r\n\r\nAfter <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14033> is merged and after the upstream apache/arrow GitHub repository migrates to using \"main\" as the default branch name, the hard-coded string \"master\" should be replaced with \"main\" inside of the implementation of the computed property \"default_branch_name\" of the \"Repo\" class in dev/archery/archery/crossbow/core.py.\r\n\r\nA similar instance of hard-coded \"master\" is used in `[dev/merge_arrow_pr.py](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14533/files#diff-4aea0167b68c23bb8725640aec90bfc1d4caed14e9c21e1b64d65a54f9b47e63)` and it needs to be updated as well.",
