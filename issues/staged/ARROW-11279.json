Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the rust implementation of an Arrow RecordBatch writer to parquet (3.0.0-SNAPSHOT), the ArrowWriter::write call potentially allocates more memory than required.\r\n\r\nFor a RecordBatch with m rows and n columns, ArrowWriter::write allocates m\\*n definition levels, leading to m times the required memory usage.",
