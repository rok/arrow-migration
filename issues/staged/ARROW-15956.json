        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15956](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15956). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Java Flight integration tests are an \"example\" but IMO they are a poor example: there's a lot going on that isn't strictly necessary, and beyond the code, there's not much presentation. Also, they serve double duty as example/integration test, but this means code is split between the \"example\" and the integration test. We would be better off with a full example in the cookbook, and consolidating and simplifying the integration test code. Also, we should make the integration test code better about reporting errors to debug issues like ARROW-15953.",
