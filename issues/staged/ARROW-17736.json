        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17736](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17736). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment there is no agreed URI base for the standard Substrait functions.  The Substrait consumer is currently expecting `https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/blob/main/extensions/FILENAME.YAML` but Isthmus is currently generating `/FILENAME.YAML`.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a short-term problem I could imagine it popping up again from time to time when users are developing their own functions.  So, as a workaround, I suggest that any URI equal to the empty string or \"/\" should be treated as a \"shortcut\" and we fall back to name-only matching.",
