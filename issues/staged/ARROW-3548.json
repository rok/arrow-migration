Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, to store an object in the plasma object store, there are a lot of IPCs. We first call \"Create\", which does an IPC round trip. Then we call \"Seal\", which is one IPC. Then we call \"Release\", which is another IPC.\r\n\r\nFor small objects, we can just inline the object and metadata directly into the message to the store, and wait for the response (the response tells us if the object was successfully created). This is just a single IPC round trip, which can be much faster.",
