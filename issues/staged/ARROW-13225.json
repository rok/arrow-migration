        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13225). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently it's a bit difficult to utilize the authhandlers and still have custom middleware due to the way that grpc handles interceptors so we can create interfaces for Client and Server Middleware and then have helper functions that use the interfaces to create interceptors to make it much easier to create middleware regardless of being Stream or Unary requests.\r\n\r\nOnce we do that, we can enable the FlightRPC integration tests with Go.",
