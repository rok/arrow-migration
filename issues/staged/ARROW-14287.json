        "title": "[R] Selecting colums while reading Parquet file with nested types can give wrong column",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14287](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14287). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI created two small files (using Python for my convenience):\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\ntable = pa.table({\"a\": [1, 2], \"b\": [3, 4]})\r\npq.write_table(table, \"test1.parquet\")\r\n\r\ntable = pa.table({\"a\": [1, 2], \"nested\": [[{'f1': 1, 'f2': 3}, {'f1': 3, 'f2': 4}], None], \"b\": [3, 4]})\r\npq.write_table(table, \"test2.parquet\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the first is a simple file, and the second contains a column with a nested list of struct type.\r\n\r\nReading that in R with a column selection works in the first case, but actually reads the second column instead of third in the second case:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n> arrow::read_parquet(\"test1.parquet\", col_select=c(\"b\"))\r\n  b\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n> arrow::read_parquet(\"test2.parquet\", col_select=c(\"b\"))\r\n  nested\r\n1   3, 4\r\n2   NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to the simple conversion of column names to integer indices in the R code, while Parquet counts the individual fields of nested columns separately.",
