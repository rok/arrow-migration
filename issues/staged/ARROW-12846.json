        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12846](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12846). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRunning  dev/release/05-binary-upload.sh takes a long time and is prone to network failures, etc. When it fails, it needs to be started from scratch.\r\n\r\nIMO we could alleviate this. An idea here would be to run the script in the same order of the configuration variables that it has (e.g. `UPLOAD_AMAZON_LINUX_RPM`) and echo the variable when binaries corresponding to that section are complete.\r\n\r\nThis way, when something fails, as a user I can pass r.g. `UPLOAD_AMAZON_LINUX_RPM=0` and skip the parts that were already uploaded.\r\n",
