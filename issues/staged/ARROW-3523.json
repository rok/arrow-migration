Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n Currently the JS implementation relies on on the user assigning IDs for dictionaries that they create, we should do something like the C++ implementation, which uses a dictionary id memo to assign and retrieve dictionary ids in the IPC writer (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/metadata-internal.cc#L495).",
