Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs some suggested initial topics for the FAQ:\n\n- How Apache Arrow is related to Apache Parquet (the difference between a \"storage format\" and an \"in-memory format\" causes confusion)\n- How is Arrow similar to / different from Flatbuffers and Cap'n Proto\n- How Arrow uses Flatbuffers (I have had people incorrectly state to me things like \"Arrow is just Flatbuffers under the hood\")\n\nAny other ideas?",
