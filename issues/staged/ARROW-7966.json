Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the C++ Flight test client in `test_integration_client.cc` reads all batches from JSON into a Table, reads all batches in the flight stream from the server into a Table, then compares the Tables for equality.  This is potentially a problem because a record batch might have specific information that is then lost in the conversion to a Table. For example, if the server sends empty batches, the resulting Table would not be different from one with no empty batches.\r\n\r\nInstead, the client should check each record batch from the JSON file against each record batch from the server independently.
