Pyarrow defaults to writing version 1.0 parquet files, which don't yet have support for uint32 type. However, you can specify `version=\"2.4\"`  in the `write_table` call, and then it should preserve both unsigned integer types. \r\n\r\nWe plan to switch to the newer parquet version by default in the near future (see ARROW-12203 and the linked issues)"
