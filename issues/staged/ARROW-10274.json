Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe arithmetic kernels that don't use SIMD create a `vec` in memory and later copy that data into a Buffer. Maybe we could directly write the arithmetic result to a mutable buffer and prevent this redundant copy?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n    let values = (0..left.len())\r\n                .map(|i| op(left.value(i), right.value(i))) \r\n                .collect::<Vec<T::Native>>();\r\n     \r\n      \r\n            let data = ArrayData::new(\r\n          T::get_data_type(),\r\n                left.len(),\r\n                None,\r\n                null_bit_buffer,\r\n                0,\r\n                vec![Buffer::from(values.to_byte_slice())],\r\n                vec![],\r\n            );\n```\r\n\u00a0",
