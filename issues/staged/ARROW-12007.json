Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile loading a specific parquet file (arrow::read_parquet(file = file)), the following error is returned:\r\n\r\nError in parquet___arrow___FileReader__ReadTable1(self) : \r\n  Invalid: Invalid UTF8 payload\r\n\r\nI managed to load several other parquet files, it is just this specific file due to which I presume it may be due to some syntax used in this file.  As there any known bug in terms of handling the UTF8 encoding?",

That is what I thought. Is there a way to avoid this issue without fixing the non valid UTF8 source data\u00a0 ? Several other colleagues located abroad don't have this issue with this specific file. For example, could it be related to my windows language settings as well? To my knowledge the parquet files have been created with RStudio but I will need to verify that.\u00a0"
