        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8455](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8455). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeen behavior: When reading a Parquet file into Arrow with `get_record_reader_by_columns`, it will fail if one of the column of the file is a list (or any other unsupported type).\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: it should only fail if you are actually reading the column with unsuported type.",
