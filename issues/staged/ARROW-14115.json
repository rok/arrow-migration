But so we still have one place internally where we use the (de)serialization machinery ourselves, i.e. in plasma.\r\n\r\nIn the Python plasma code, we use it for the `PlasmaClient.put`/`PlasmaClient.get` to put/get generic Python objects in the plasma store (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/83e169852c21bed92924a53df8902d3a17935ceb/python/pyarrow/_plasma.pyx#L543-L547). This is something we could replace with storing the pickled object in the store? (so using pickling instead of our own custom (de)serialization)\r\n\r\nIn addition, we also use part of the `arrow::py` serialize functionality in the plasma C++ code: `WriteNdarrayHeader` (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/83e169852c21bed92924a53df8902d3a17935ceb/python/pyarrow/tensorflow/plasma_op.cc#L141) and `NdarrayFromBuffer` (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/83e169852c21bed92924a53df8902d3a17935ceb/python/pyarrow/tensorflow/plasma_op.cc#L286). It is relatively easy to only keep those two functions in (de)serialize.cc and remove the rest we no longer need. But are you aware of other internal utilities that might cover that as well?"
