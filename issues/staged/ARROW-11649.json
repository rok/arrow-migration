Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-10438 made is so that a \"null\" in a partition column will be mapped to a special directory with hive partitioning.\u00a0 By default this is __HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__ but it is configurable by other hive manipulation tools (e.g. spark) and so needs to be configurable in Arrow as well.\u00a0 The `null_fallback` option is a string that can be passed to <font color=\"#000000\">HivePartitioning::HivePartitioning and HivePartitioning::MakeFactory\r\n\r\nThis option should be exposed in R.</font>",
