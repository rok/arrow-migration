        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16063](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16063). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA number of methods in `_dataset.pyx` redirect most of their arguments to `Scanner.from_dataset` or `Scanner.from_fragment`. Their docstrings usually do the same, which is a bit user-unfriendly. Instead, we should find a way to duplicate the argument descriptions in these docstrings, while keeping numpydoc checks happy.\r\n\r\nSee original discussion at https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12698#discussion_r836371359",
