In ARROW-6793, I wrote 100 lines of R code to do this for my needs:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6068/files#diff-3875fa5e75833c426b36487b25892bd8R204-R309>\r\n\r\nWe should translate this to CMake so it's generally available.",

IMHO, we shouldn't try to build them, it's ok to ask the user/developper for build toolchain dependencies  e.g. compilers,  cmake, and yacc/flex (bison). \r\n\r\nAnother option would be to graciously fallback and disable parquet if thrift can't be compiled."

On Windows it's not so trivial since we don't necessarily have a package manager to fall back on "

It might be better to address this with ARROW-6821, the question is what kind of forward/backward compatibility there is in generated Thrift sources"
