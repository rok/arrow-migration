        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13697](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13697). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLooking at DefaultAllocationManagerOption [1], I see that we could prevent dummy NPEs when trying to convert an often not-set environment option into enums.\r\nIn my case, it was a bit painful to have this error, even if properly caught, because it was polluting debug when looking for unexpected NPEs. This was raising false positives.\r\n\u00a0\r\nI was wondering if you were open to a pull request to change this little inconvenience?\r\n\u00a0\r\n[1] <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/memory/memory-core/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/memory/DefaultAllocationManagerOption.java#L64-L82>",
