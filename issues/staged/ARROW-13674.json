Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, we have a Github Actions workflow that checks whether a PR has an associated JIRA.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if additional sanity checks against the linked JIRA were performed. One of them is whether the JIRA has any components set.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, it would also be useful to consolidate the current workflow library functions in the `.github/workflows/dev_pr/` directory. There seem to be similar functions sprinkled in different Javascript source files. Also, adding some docstring would help maintaining and evolving those functions.",

I think the simplest thing would be to leave a comment on the GitHub PR as writing comments or touching the jira issue would probably require API write privileges which seems would make the thing much more complex (private tokens etc) for a minor difference."
