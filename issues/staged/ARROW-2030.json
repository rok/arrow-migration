Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis shows up in calling \\`self._assert_readable()` which tries to read from a property that isn't exposed in child classes.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those parts of Cython that's fairly easy to trip over since its `cdef` classes don't work like Python classes.",
