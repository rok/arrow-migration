Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRelease 7.0.0 introduced a regression in parquet single file reads.  We should add a macro-level benchmark that does single-file reads to help us detect this in the future.",

That 5% there is supposed to indicate that there's an issue, but we might have that set too low such that there's alarm fatigue or|and we should alert louder when there are this many high-change benchmarks (e.g. the file-read benchmark z-scores range from a -76 to -759, and we alert at -5) "
