Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince the Julia implementation claims to support the IPC protocol, it would good to include it in integration testing to ensure cross-implementation compatibility.\r\n\r\nYou can take a look at <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Integration.html> for basics of integration testing, but feel free to ask any question.",
