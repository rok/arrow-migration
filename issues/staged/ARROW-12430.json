However, I do understand there is a license concern w.r.t using lzo library since it's under GPL2. I am not sure if you can take the change set.",

It is not clear whether making use of the LZO APIs absolutely requires adherence to the GPL by Arrow itself.\r\n\r\nThe GNU readline library (GPL-licensed) is in a similar situation and it [states](https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) that you may make use of it inside software licensed under any GPL-compatible license (the Apache license 2.0 is GPL-compatible according to the FSF). However, the FSF [contradicts its own advice](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.en.html#IfLibraryIsGPL) in the GPL FAQ.\r\n\r\nIf you feel strongly about this feature, you should probably contact the LZO author and ask them their position, because that is what matters.\r\n\r\nNote that, in any case, we would not distribute binaries with LZO enabled; you would have to compile Arrow yourself for that."

I don't need need binary distribution, I can compile arrow by myself, that is fine."
