        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2683](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2683). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\npyarrow version from python repl:\r\n```\n\r\n>>> import pyarrow\r\n>>> pyarrow.__version__\r\n'0.9.0.post1'\n```\r\npython interpreter information:\r\n```\n\r\nPython 3.6.5 (default, Mar 30 2018, 06:42:10)\r\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)] on darwin\n```\r\narbitrary, potentially relevant system information:\r\n```\n\r\nOS                       : macOS High Sierra (10.13.4)\r\nhomebrew package         : python: stable 3.6.5 (bottled), devel 3.7.0b4, HEAD\r\npip version              : pip 10.0.1\r\npipenv version           : pipenv, version 2018.05.18\r\npyarrow version (via pip): pyarrow\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.9.0.post1\r\ncython version (via pip) : Cython\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.28.2\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIssue Description:\r\n\r\nI see a ResourceWarning, which doesn't seem to be an error, but\u00a0seems important enough (a.k.a. annoying enough) that I thought it would be worth\u00a0asking about. `[~xhochy]` was nice enough to respond in\u00a0 #general in the arrow slack.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. with this code in a python unittest:\n   ```\n   \n   def test_arrow_from_parquet(self):\n   table = parquet.read_table(<path as str>)\n   ```\n   I see this warning:\n   ```\n   \n   ResourceWarning: unclosed file <_io.BufferedReader name=<path_to_file>\n   ```\n1. I tried adding the following, per Uwe's request:\n   ```\n   \n   warnings.simplefilter(\"error\")\n   ```\n1. I then see this information:\n   ```\n   \n   test_arrow_from_parquet (tests.datalayer_test.TestFileReader) ... Exception ignored in: <_io.FileIO name=<path_to_file> mode='rb' closefd=True>\n   \n   ResourceWarning: unclosed file <_io.BufferedReader name=<path_to_file>>\n   ```\n1. Uwe's thoughts:\n   ```\n   \n   That could be a valid error. We don\u2019t seem to close the file we open in `ParquetFile.__init__`\n   ```\n   \u00a0",
