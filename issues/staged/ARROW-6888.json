        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6888](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6888). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn this issue, we provide copy operations for vector value comparators. This operation creates another comparator with the same type and comparison logic.\r\n\r\nThis feature is useful in multi-threading scenarios where multiple threads uses the comparator to perform their own task. In this scenario, we have no way of making sure the compare method is thread safe. So a safe way is to create a new comparator for each thread. The copy operation will support this.\r\n\r\nAn immediate application of this is the parallel searcher for ordering semantics. ",
