        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8780](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8780). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe new `pyarrow.fs` FileSystem objects have a limited Python API (currently mimicking the C++ API).\r\n\r\nIn Python, [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest) defines a common API for a variety filesystem implementations. \r\n\r\nWe could try to implement a, fsspec-compatible class wrapping the `pyarrow.fs` native filesystems. Such as class would provide the methods expected according to fsspec, and implement those using the actual `pyarrow.fs.FileSystem` under the hood.\r\n\r\nThis might be mainly useful for two use cases:\r\n\r\n- `pyarrow.fs` filesystems can be used in settings that expect an fsspec-compatible filesytem object\n- it provides a way to have a \"richer\" API around our `pyarrow.fs` filesystems (which has been requested before, cfr ARROW-7584), without expanding the core filesystem objects",

I'll close https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7584. This looks good to me. The new wrapper could then still be enhanced  with more functions as a next step (if necessary) either via fsspec base classes or directly in the pyarrow wrapper."

It might still be good to document this on the pyarrow side as a way to get an fsspec-compatible filesystem object from a pyarrow filesystem."
