        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-245](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-245). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer August 2016 mailing list question re: big endian platforms, we have in the format document:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Layout.md#byte-order-endianness\n\nWe should clarify that this does not mean that Arrow cannot be used on big endian platforms, but rather that the canonical or \"in-flight\" memory representation (for IPC or memory sharing of any kind) is little-endian, so big endian systems would need to byte swap big endian integers if they intend to expose memory to any other system using Arrow.

That way data is labelled correctly and we can have a check in the RPC layer to make sure we don't read data with the wrong endianness.\nSo as mentioned in the thread we can support communication between systems with the same endianness at no cost without the risk of silent data corruption."

For now, on read we can validate that the message matches our native endianness. "
