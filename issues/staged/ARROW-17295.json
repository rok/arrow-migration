Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen building arrow _static_ libraries with bundled dependencies, we produce `{}arrow_bundled_dependencies.a{`}. But when building dynamic libraries, the bundled dependencies are statically linked directly into the arrow libraries (libarrow, libarrow_flight, etc.). This means that users can access the symbols of bundled dependencies in the static case, but not in the dynamic library case.\r\n\r\nOne use case of this is being able to pass in gRPC configuration to a Flight server, which requires access to gRPC symbols.\r\n\r\nCould we change the dynamic library building to build an `arrow_bundled_dependencies.so` so that the symbols are accessible?",
