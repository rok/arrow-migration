Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA RecordBatchStreamWriter initialised with a given schema will still allow writing RecordBatches that have different schemas. Example:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nschema = pa.schema([pa.field('some_field', pa.int64())])\r\nstream = pa.BufferOutputStream()\r\nwriter = pa.RecordBatchStreamWriter(stream, schema)\r\n\r\ndata = [pa.array([1.234])]\r\nbatch = pa.RecordBatch.from_arrays(data, ['some_field'])\u00a0 \r\n# batch does not conform to schema\r\n\r\nassert batch.schema != schema\r\n\r\nwriter.write_batch(batch)\u00a0 # no exception raised\r\nwriter.close()\r\n```",
