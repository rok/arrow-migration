        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17000](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17000). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nengine/substrait/type_internal.cc has some already-implemented logic and some TODOs relating to rejecting an Acero plan for conversion to Substrait if field metadata and names are not set to default values, as Substrait does not support these things. ARROW-16988 introduces conversion options that clarify how the converter should behave in cases like these, so once that issue is complete this may be further implemented.",
