Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `arrow_vendored::date` library allows us to write date/time formatting routines relatively easily, but it may throw exceptions or return silently erroneous data (see ARROW-12011). We should audit all our uses or date/time formatting routines from that library and make sure we don't let corner cases slip through.",
