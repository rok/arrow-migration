Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA recent discussion on the listserv (link below) asked about how\u00a0contributors should handle rebasing. It would be helpful if the tips made it into the developer documentation somehow. I suggest in the [\"Contributing to Apache Arrow\"](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW/Contributing+to+Apache+Arrow) page\u2014currently a wiki, but hopefully\u00a0eventually\u00a0part of the Sphinx\u00a0docs\u00a0ARROW-4427.\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant thread:\r\n\r\n<https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c74d8027184550b8d9041e3f2414b517ffb76ccbc1d5aa4563d364b6@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E>",
