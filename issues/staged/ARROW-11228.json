        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11228](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11228). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBoth jemalloc and mimalloc allow for some amount of fine tuning from environment variables.\u00a0 However, in some cases, the settings entered into these environment variables are overridden by arrow.\r\n\r\nFor example, jemalloc docs describe MALLOC_CONF, an environment variable that can be used to tune any jemalloc parameter.\u00a0 But, the global variable `malloc_conf` (which arrow uses) takes precedence.\r\n\r\nMimalloc also exposes some tuning parameters (<https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc/environment.html)>.\u00a0 I have not tested which of these work and which do not work so it may be that all of them are accessible already.\r\n\r\nTuning may be useful in certain environments (for example, if someone wanted to use jemalloc over mimalloc in an environment where overcommit is disabled and so they wanted to set the retain:true option) and so it would be good to allow for these tuning parameters to be set at runtime.\u00a0 One potential solution may be to expose our own environment variable (e.g. ARROW_MALLOC_CONF).",
