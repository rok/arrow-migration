        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8324](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8324). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6771#issuecomment-608133760>\r\n> Let's add read/write_ipc_file also? I'm wary of the \"version\" option in \"write_feather\" and the Feather version inference capability in \"read_feather\". It's potentially confusing and we may choose to add options to write_ipc_file/read_ipc_file that are more developer centric, having to do with particulars in the IPC format, that are not relevant or appropriate for the Feather APIs.\n> \n> IMHO it's best for \"Feather format\" to remain an abstracted higher-level concept with its use of the \"IPC file format\" as an implementation detail, and segregated from the other things.",
