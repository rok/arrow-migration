Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe could add Sphinx extensions to the existing Development part of the documentation so that users will be able to copy-paste code from the code-blocks. Need to make sure that only the code is copied and not $ with it for example.\r\n\r\nSee the link for ideas:\r\n<https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/41>",
