        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5440](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5440). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello,\r\n\r\nIn the\u00a0rust parquet implementation (<https://github.com/sunchao/parquet-rs>) on centos, the binary created has a `libstd-hash.so` shared library dependency that is causing issues since it's a shared library found in the rustup directory. This `libstd-hash.so` dependency isn't there on any other rust binaries I've made before. This dependency means that I can't run this binary anywhere where rustup isn't installed with that exact libstd library.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue on Mac.\r\n\r\nI've attached the rust files and here is the command line output below.\r\n```java\n\r\n[centos@_ parquet-test]$ cat /etc/centos-release\r\n\r\nCentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)\r\n\r\n[centos@_ parquet-test]$ rustc --version\r\n\r\nrustc 1.36.0-nightly (e70d5386d 2019-05-27)\r\n\r\n[centos@_ parquet-test]$ ldd target/release/parquet-test\r\n\r\nlinux-vdso.so.1 =>\u00a0 (0x00007ffd02fee000)\r\n\r\nlibstd-44988553032616b2.so => not found\r\n\r\nlibrt.so.1 => /lib64/librt.so.1 (0x00007f6ecd209000)\r\n\r\nlibpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f6eccfed000)\r\n\r\nlibgcc_s.so.1 => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f6eccdd7000)\r\n\r\nlibc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f6ecca0a000)\r\n\r\nlibm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f6ecc708000)\r\n\r\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f6ecd8b1000)\r\n\r\n[centos@_ parquet-test]$ ls -l ~/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-44988553032616b2.so\r\n\r\n-rw-r--r--.\u00a01 centos centos 5623568 May 27 21:46 /home/centos/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-44988553032616b2.so\r\n\r\n```",

I'm pretty sure the libstd should be statically linked like it usually is.\r\n\r\nOn our project which has many other dependencies, when we include\u00a0the parquet crate, we get\u00a0the\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nlibstd-44988553032616b2.so => not found\n```\r\nissue, but if we remove it, that dependency goes away.[serde_json_test.tar.gz](serde_json_test.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nI attached a simple serde_json test code as an example that also doesn't have the libstd dependency\r\n```java\n\r\n[centos@_ serde_json_test]$ ldd target/release/serde_json_test\r\n\r\nlinux-vdso.so.1 =>\u00a0 (0x00007ffdc35c6000)\r\n\r\nlibdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f5780cb3000)\r\n\r\nlibrt.so.1 => /lib64/librt.so.1 (0x00007f5780aab000)\r\n\r\nlibpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f578088f000)\r\n\r\nlibgcc_s.so.1 => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f5780679000)\r\n\r\nlibc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f57802ac000)\r\n\r\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f5781102000)\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt's possible it's a parquet dependency that's causing this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks"

I just gave an example of another crate that doesn't have the libstd issue. I was hoping someone might have an idea, and no one would have to go through each crate the parquet-rs depends on. It might just be one specific crate that could be the issue."

I can't reproduce the problem discussed here anymore, and we're not having problems building recent versions of the crate. Unfortunately our toolchain management was very spotty a year ago so it's possible this was an interaction with a particular nightly, but I'm not going to start guessing around to figure that out."
