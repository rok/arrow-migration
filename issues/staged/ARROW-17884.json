        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17884](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17884). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIntel\u00ae In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (Intel\u00ae IAA) is a hardware accelerator available in the upcoming generation of Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable processors (\"Sapphire Rapids\"). Its goal is to speed up common operations in analytics like data (de)compression and filtering. It support decoding of Parquet RLE format. We add new codec which utilizes the Intel\u00ae IAA offloading technology to provide a high-performance RLE decode implementation. The codec uses the\u00a0[Intel\u00ae Query Processing Library (QPL)](https://github.com/intel/qpl)\u00a0which abstracts access to the hardware accelerator. The new solution provides in general higher performance against current solution, and also consume less CPU.",
