        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5077](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5077). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the dev tree we use relative path dependencies between arrow, parquet, and datafusion, which means we can't just run cargo publish for each crate from the release source tarball.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have the relaese packaging change the Cargo.toml for parquet and datafusion to have dependencies on a versioned release instead of a relative path to remove this manual step when publishing.",
