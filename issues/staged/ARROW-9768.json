Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn parquet, I want to store date values as timestamp format with nanoseconds precision. This works fine with most dates except those past pandas.Timestamp.max:\u00a0[https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.max.html.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.max.html)\r\n\r\nI was expecting some exception to be raised (like in Pandas), however this did not happen and the value was processed incorrectly. Note that this is with safe=True. Can this please be looked into? Thanks\r\n\r\n`Example Code:`\r\n\r\n`pa.array([datetime(2262,4,12)], type=pa.timestamp(\"ns\"))`\r\n \\``\r\n\r\n`Return:`\r\n\r\n`[`\r\n \\` 1677-09-21 00:25:26.290448384`\r\n `]`",

We should indeed ensure that this raises. \r\n\r\nOn casting we already check for this and raise appropriately:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [13]: pa.array(np.array([datetime(2262,4,12)])).cast(pa.timestamp('ns'))                                                                                                                                        \r\n...\r\nArrowInvalid: Casting from timestamp[us] to timestamp[ns] would result in out of bounds timestamp: 9223372800000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this should also be done in the typed array converter."
