Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe (temporarily) need to install DuckDB from github to avoid using their unity build. Our detection of that has been slightly off (e.g. https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/4480088131?check_suite_focus=true isn't building from github) and we see sporadic time outs.\r\n\r\nThis changes that to hopefully always catch when we would install it and pre-install the github version",
