        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14024). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt first glance it seems like Parquet's reader should work.  The ScanOptions::batch_size property is forwarded into the ArrowReaderProperties for the parquet::arrow::FileReader.  However, we then use ReadOneRowGroup which doesn't look at the batch_size option.\r\n\r\nThe IPC reader simply doesn't look at the property at all.\r\n\r\nEven if we can't control the source read size (e.g. we have to read a full row group / record batch and have no control over its size) we can still split whatever we read into smaller batches that respect the batch size.  This is important for achieving parallelism as we can then partition the CPU work across these batches.",
