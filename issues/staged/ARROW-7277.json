Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7254?focusedCommentId=16983284&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16983284, we need a discussion about the lifecycle of a vector.\r\n\r\nEach vector has a lifecycle, and different operations should be performed in particular phases of the lifecycle. If we violate this, some unexpected results may be produced. This may cause some confusion for Arrow users. So we want to add a new section to the prose document, to make it clear and explicit.",
