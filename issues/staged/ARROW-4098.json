Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn interest of disambiguating different meanings of \"streams\" and \"files\" I propose that we change these APIs to come out of the `pyarrow.ipc` namespace. To help with the transition, we can maintain functions in the top level namespace that create a FutureWarning. Since a lot of people use these functions, we should probably give them 2 major releases to get migrated",
