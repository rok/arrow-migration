Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nperhaps not for this PR, but, depending on the number of rows and cols this record contains, this may be a very large allocation, and very big memory chunk.\r\nit could be more interesting performance wise to write n rows instead of everything in one big chunk.\r\n\r\nalso, to reduce the memory pressure on the GC, we should probably (re)use this slice-of-slice of strings.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
