Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am trying to build c++ libraries on Centos 7.5. parquet only. I followed the instruction on github and did as below\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git\r\ncd arrow/cpp\r\nmkdir debug\r\ncd debug\r\ncmake .. -DARROW_PARQUET=ON -DARROW_OPTIONAL_INSTALL=ON\r\nmake parquet\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI don't have Third party libraries installed on my box, so it tries to download thirdparties in the building process but I got error after it says that thrift has been downloaded and installed.\r\n```java\n\r\nNo rule to make target thrift_ep/src/thrift_ep-install/lib/libthriftd.a', needed bysrc/parquet/parquet_types.cpp'. Stop\n```\r\n\r\nbefore the error, it says\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n\r\n[ 7%] Performing configure step for 'thrift_ep'\r\n-- thrift_ep configure command succeeded. See also /home/ylei/development/third_party/parquet/arrow/arrow/cpp/debug/thrift_ep-prefix/src/thrift_ep-stamp/thrift_ep-configure-.log\r\n[ 8%] Performing build step for 'thrift_ep'\r\n-- thrift_ep build command succeeded. See also /home/ylei/development/third_party/parquet/arrow/arrow/cpp/debug/thrift_ep-prefix/src/thrift_ep-stamp/thrift_ep-build-.log\r\n[ 9%] Performing install step for 'thrift_ep'\r\n-- thrift_ep install command succeeded. See also /home/ylei/development/third_party/parquet/arrow/arrow/cpp/debug/thrift_ep-prefix/src/thrift_ep-stamp/thrift_ep-install-*.log\r\n[ 10%] Completed 'thrift_ep'\r\n[ 10%] Built target thrift_ep\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had to build thrift separately and then I can build parquet sucessfully",
