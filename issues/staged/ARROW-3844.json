Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThose options can be detected programmatically (SSE3 is available on all recent x86-64 CPUs). Instead we may want to add a ARROW_DISABLE_SIMD option if we want to disable all SIMD optimizations at compile-time (e.g. for comparing and testing).",
