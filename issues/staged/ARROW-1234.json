I don't have ASF access myself to configure it in the <https://builds.apache.org/> but for someone who can do the procedure should be:\n\n```Java\n$ curl -o /tmp/jenkins-cli.jar http://builds.apache.org:8080/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar\n$ java -jar /tmp/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://<user>:<pass>@builds.apache.org:8080 create-job Arrow_Development_Deploy < /tmp/arrow_development_deploy.xml\n```\n\nThings that might need tweaking:\nGo to <https://builds.apache.org/job/Arrow_Development_Deploy/configure> in the `Build` section towards the bottom select existing `Maven Version` from the dropdown (depends on the Jenkins setup)"

From my understanding, the jenkins config Antony proposed checks out arrow from github and then run \"mvn clean deploy\" under java, which will publish snapshot artifacts to https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots.\n> \n> Antony, do you have some comments?\n> \n> Li\n\nCorrect, the parent Apache POM defines the deployment to this ASF repository plus the ASF Jenkins instance is privileged to deploy into that repository so the proposed jenkins config is a daily scheduled job to simply pull master from github and running the deploy - that's all to do the trick I believe..."
