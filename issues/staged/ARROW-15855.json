        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15855](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15855). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAlthough the python Parquet api is a wrapper of C+\\, there are some tuning knobs not included in python. For example, dictionary_pagesize_limit_. The dictionary page size will easily exceed the limit when any or many of the followings happen: 1. The row_group_size is relatively large e.g. the default is 64M. 2. The size per entry is large e.g large string column 3. the repeatability of data is not so high. This may result in the dictionary encoding not being fully utilized if this parameter cannot be tuned. In C\\+, however, this parameter can be tuned to the optimized setting.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are also other parameters not exposed in python, for example, max_statistics_size.",
