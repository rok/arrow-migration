Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRequires PARQUET-1324 and probably quite a bit of extra work  \r\n\r\nProperly implementing this will require dictionary normalization across row groups. When reading a new row group, a fast path that compares the current dictionary with the prior dictionary should be used. This also needs to handle the case where a column chunk \"fell back\" to PLAIN encoding mid-stream",
