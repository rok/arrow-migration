Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis can also accompany an alternate IPC loader which does not use `shared_ptr<Buffer>` or other currently-in-use tools for RAII-based object lifetime.\n\nFor example, we would be able to expose `arrow::StringArray` to C code in a struct like\n\n```Java\ntypedef struct {\n  int64_t length;\n  int64_t offset;\n  int64_t null_count;\n  const uint8_t* valid_bits;\n} arrow_array_t;\n\ntypedef struct {\n  struct arrow_array_t base;\n  const int32_t* offsets;\n  const uint8_t* data;\n} arrow_string_array_t;\n```",
