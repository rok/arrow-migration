Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe dominant part of the time spent running the integration tests is one test case named \"generated_large_batch.json\". It is not obvious how useful this test case is. Ideally, integration test cases should be small enough to only take a fraction of a second.",

I think we could reduce the size though (to a few 10s of MBs instead of the very large size it currently is)."
