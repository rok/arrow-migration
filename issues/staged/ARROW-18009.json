Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAn example that was raised is being able to create a sink node that sends data across a flight connection.  We don't have such a sink node yet but one could imagine a situation where we receive the flight request via python, parse out a substrait query, and then pass the flight connection into run_substrait_query to be used as a sink.",
