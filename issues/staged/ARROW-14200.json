        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14200](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14200). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen the input to `strftime` is a date, timezones shouldn't be necessary or assumed.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is going on below is the date 1992-01-01 is being interpreted as 1992-01-01 00:00:00 in UTC, and then when `strftime()` is being called it's displaying that timestamp as 1991-12-31 ... (since my system is set to an after UTC timezone), and then taking the year out of it. If I specify `tz = \"utc\"` in the `strftime()`, I get the expected result (though that shouldn't be necessary).\r\n\r\n\r\nRun in the US central timezone:\r\n```Java\n\r\nlibrary(arrow, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\nlibrary(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\nlibrary(lubridate, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\nTable$create(\r\n  data.frame(\r\n    x = as.Date(\"1992-01-01\")\r\n  )\r\n) %>% \r\n  mutate(\r\n    as_int_strftime = as.integer(strftime(x, \"%Y\")),\r\n    strftime = strftime(x, \"%Y\"),\r\n    as_int_strftime_utc = as.integer(strftime(x, \"%Y\", tz = \"UTC\")),\r\n    strftime_utc = strftime(x, \"%Y\", tz = \"UTC\"),\r\n    year = year(x)\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n#>            x as_int_strftime strftime as_int_strftime_utc strftime_utc year\r\n#> 1 1992-01-01            1991     1991                1992         1992 1992\r\n```",

It is working correctly in python.  It appears the R bindings for strftime are casting to a timestamp and always specifying some kind of time zone: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/b5814b6bcc6a242fd2a5be0b44cddb02cb60f088/r/R/dplyr-functions.R#L712\r\n"

Should't be too hard to match the behavior once you know what it is."
