Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo start, this will encompass only lists containing flat data (i.e. no list or dict members). For example:\n\n```Java\n[1, 2, None, 3, 4]\n['foo', 'bar', None, 'baz']\n[True, False, False, True, None]\n```\n\nType inference on more complicated Python lists (as occurring from `json.loads`, for example) is something we can explore later (if it is deemed useful).",
