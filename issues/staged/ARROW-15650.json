        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15650](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15650). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the main MEX function is named `{}mexfcn{`}. `mexfcn` delegates to C++ functions that implement the functionality of the MATLAB Interface to Arrow.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen the interface is installed, the name, `{}mexfcn{`}, is on the global MATLAB Search Path and may cause conflicts with functionality outside of the MATLAB Interface to Arrow.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes the following changes:\r\n \\* Rename the MEX function to `call.`\r\n \\* Install the MEX function to the MATLAB package folder hierarchy: `+arrow/+cpp.`\r\n \\* Install all dependencies of the MEX function to the same package folder hierarchy.",
