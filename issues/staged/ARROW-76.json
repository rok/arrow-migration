Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter many mailing list discussions and a first draft of metadata serialization (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Message.fbs), I propose we strike the notion of required fields from the physical memory layout and instead make this a property of the metadata (see the `nullable` member of `Field` in the serialized schema metadata). \n\nNote that Arrow implementations will be free to create specialized containers for data having `nullable = false` in their metadata. It will be the implementations' responsibility to validate that `null_count == 0` at IPC boundaries when interacting with \"untrusted\" data. ",
