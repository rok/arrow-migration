Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n/docs/c_glib/index.html is generated by Jekyll and has some basic content (it would be nice if it had more :) and links to reference docs, but https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/scripts/docs_build.sh#L40 seems to be overwriting it, so it's missing from the published site.",
