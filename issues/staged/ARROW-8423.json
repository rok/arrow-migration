Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe C++ implementation uses\u00a0\u00a0\"ARROW:schema\" as a value to store the arrow schema as metadata. Implement same for compatibility.\r\n\r\nHaving the original Arrow schema is useful for readers as it preserves some properties like dictionary encoding.",
