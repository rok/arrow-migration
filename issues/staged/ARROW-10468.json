Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFunctionExecutor currently handles dispatch to a kernel as well as allocation and invocation of the kernel. In some contexts (such as a filter expression bound to a specific schema) we only need to perform dispatch once, so repeatedly dispatching to kernel is redundant. Refactor to a KernelExecutor which is constructed from a pre-selected kernel.",
