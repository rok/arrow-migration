        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1090](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1090). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI believe (based on some confusing time with the build toolchain) that\n\n- If `ARROW_HOME` is set, attempting to build_ext with `PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP` will fail because `FindArrow.cmake` will not set `ARROW_ABI_VERSION`.\n- `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` must be set correctly for a bundled build to work.\n- `--bundle-arrow-cpp` may not do anything (vs `PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP`), but is referenced in build scripts.\n\nI'd be happy to submit a PR which checks for some of these conditions in setup.py and bails with a helpful message, and/or update `development.rst` to include a wheel-building block.\n\n\n",

This is a pretty rough edge, would you mind submitting a patch? It doesn't seem like this should fail, so if it's possible to make it pass that would be great. Updating the documentation would also be very nice. "
