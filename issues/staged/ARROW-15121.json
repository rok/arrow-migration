Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current implementation ignores the `max_recursion` attribute in the selector.  Seems like a useful thing to do.\r\n\r\nIn GCS it is **more** expensive to do `ls foo/` and then recurse over the results than to do a `ls -R foo/`.  The running time of a (recursive or non-recursive) operation is proportional to the number of objects in the prefix, not to the number of objects returned.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the implementation will probably list all the objects and directories, and simply filter out those that are \"too deep\" in the recursion hierarchy.",
