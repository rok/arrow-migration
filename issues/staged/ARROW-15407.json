        "title": "[Python] Change the default write partitioning flavor to hive",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15407). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHive partitioning round trips smoothly as it doesn't require the reader to specify the column names on read like they have to do with directory partitioning.  We already default to hive in some places (e.g. parquet.write_to_dataset) but we do not do so on dataset.write_dataset.\r\n\r\nTo alleviate backwards compatibility issues Joris suggested a deprecation cycle.\r\n\r\nFirst stage:\r\n\r\n  \\* If a partitioning is specified and it is not a list of columns then do nothing.\r\n  \\* If a partitioning is specified and it is a list of columns but the user has explicitly set partitioning_flavor then do nothing.\r\n  \\* If a partitioning is specified and it is a list of columns and the user has not explicitly set partitioning_flavor then default to directory and emit a warning:\r\n\r\n\"The default partitioning_flavor will be changing from 'directory' to 'hive' in future releases.  To silence this warning please explicitly set a the partitioning_flavor\"\r\n\r\nSecond stage:\r\n  \\* If a partitioning is specified and it is not a list of columns then do nothing. (same as before)\r\n  \\* If a partitioning is specified and it is a list of columns but the user has explicitly set partitioning_flavor then do nothing. (same as before)\r\n  \\* If a partitioning is specified and it is a list of columns and the user has not explicitly set partitioning_flavor then default to hive.",
