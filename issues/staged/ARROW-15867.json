Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen you don't have pandas installed, you can get an \"error\" like\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nException ignored in: 'pyarrow.lib._PandasAPIShim._have_pandas_internal'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"pyarrow/pandas-shim.pxi\", line 110, in pyarrow.lib._PandasAPIShim._check_import\r\n  File \"pyarrow/pandas-shim.pxi\", line 59, in pyarrow.lib._PandasAPIShim._import_pandas\r\nAttributeError: module 'pandas' has no attribute '__version__'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not an actual error that interrupts your Python session (it's an ignored exception), but we should of course still ensure to not print it.\r\n\r\n",

(I have the feeling I did in the past as well, thinking it was a bug, to then figure out it was my own fault .. :))"
