        "title": "[R] Name collision of arrow.dll on Windows conda",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8281). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we build the R extension for Windows only for CRAN with static linkage. For conda-forge, we though want to build it with dynamic linkage to `arrow-cpp`. Here we come into the issue that the R packages as well as the C++ package produces an `arrow.dll`. As there is no RPATH equivalent on Windows, the dynamic loader cannot find the right relatonship of both and fails to load the library.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, the simplest approach here would be to name the R `arrow.dll` differently, e.g. `rarrow.dll`. Would this be possible?",
