        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13409](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13409). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello Arrow Team,\r\n\r\nRight now if there is an active client connection to Flight Server , call to\r\n```java\n\r\nserver->ShutDown\r\n```\r\nwill hang until client disconnects. It seems currently there is no way to force server shutdown.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI believe the reason for this is following:\r\nInside\r\n```java\n\r\nimpl_->server_->ShutDown()\n```\r\nhappens\r\n```java\n\r\ng_core_codegen_interface->gpr_inf_future(GPR_CLOCK_MONOTONIC)\n```\r\nthus server has infinite deadline on waiting to finish connections.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you add option for forced shutdown or point me to some existing way to shutdown server independently on client connections.\r\n\r\nThank you",
