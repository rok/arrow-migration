        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7026). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently assertions exists in many classes like `MessagaSerializer/JsonReader/JsonWriter/ListVector`\u00a0etc.\r\n\r\ni. If jvm arguments are not specified, these checks will skipped and lead to potential problems.\r\n\r\nii. Java errors produced by failed assertions are not caught by traditional catch clauses.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, use `Preconditions`\u00a0instead.",
