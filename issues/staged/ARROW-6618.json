        "title": "[Python] Reading a zero-size buffer can segfault",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6618](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6618). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimplest reproducible code is:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\npa.read_message(b'')\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich gives a segfault. \r\n\r\nYou can easily run into this interactively when eg by accident passing a already-read buffer to it, like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nserialized = pa.schema([('a', pa.int64())]).serialize().to_pybytes()\r\nbuffer = pa.BufferReader(serialized)\r\npa.read_message(buffer)\r\npa.read_message(buffer)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd for example, if you compare to `read_schema`, this gives an error on the second time / empty buffer:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> pa.read_schema(buffer)\r\n>>> pa.read_schema(buffer)\r\n...\r\nArrowInvalid: Tried reading schema message, was null or length 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know this is not proper usage of Buffer(Reader), but since it is easy to accidentally do this, we should try to protect users from this I think.",
