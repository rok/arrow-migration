        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5912](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5912). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when having objects with mixed timezones, they are each separately interpreted as their local time:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> ts_pd_paris = pd.Timestamp(\"1970-01-01 01:00\", tz=\"Europe/Paris\")\r\n>>> ts_pd_paris    \r\nTimestamp('1970-01-01 01:00:00+0100', tz='Europe/Paris')\r\n>>> ts_pd_helsinki = pd.Timestamp(\"1970-01-01 02:00\", tz=\"Europe/Helsinki\")\r\n>>> ts_pd_helsinki\r\nTimestamp('1970-01-01 02:00:00+0200', tz='Europe/Helsinki')\r\n\r\n>>> a = pa.array([ts_pd_paris, ts_pd_helsinki])                                                                                                              \r\n>>> a\r\n<pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at 0x7f7856c4a360>\r\n[\r\n  1970-01-01 01:00:00.000000,\r\n  1970-01-01 02:00:00.000000\r\n]\r\n>>> a.type\r\nTimestampType(timestamp[us])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo both times are actually about the same moment in time (the same value in UTC; in pandas their stored `value` is also the same), but once converted to pyarrow, they are both tz-naive but no longer the same time. That seems rather unexpected and a source for bugs.\r\n\r\nI think a better option would be to normalize to UTC, and result in a tz-aware TimestampArray with UTC as timezone. \r\nThat is also the behaviour of pandas if you force the conversion to result in datetimes (by default pandas will keep them as object array preserving the different timezones).",

It only takes the first encountered timezone. I think ideally in case of multiple timezones, it would use UTC instead, but at least the result is already more correct now (the actual values stored under the hood are correctly normalized to UTC)."
