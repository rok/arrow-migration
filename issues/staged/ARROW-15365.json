        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15365](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15365). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the `pc.cast` function has a `safe=True/False` option, which provides a short-cut to setting the cast options. \r\n\r\nBut the actual kernel has more detailed options that can be tuned, and this is already exposed in the CastOptions class in python (allow_int_overflow, allow_time_truncate, ...). So we should ensure that we can pass such a CastOptions object to the `cast` kernel directly as well.",
