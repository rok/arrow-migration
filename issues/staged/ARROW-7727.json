        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7727](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7727). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was trying to read a subset of my parquet files using the ParquetDataset object with a predefined schema, when it tries to validate the schema a `to_arrow_schema` is called and the schema does not support this. I don't what is happening, this is a sample.\u00a0\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nschema = pa.schema([\r\n    pa.field(\"field1\", pa.string()),\r\n    pa.field(\"field2\", pa.string()),\r\n    pa.field(\"field3\", pa.string()),\r\n])\r\n\r\n ...\r\n\r\npq_dataset = pq.ParquetDataset(file_groups[0], schema=schema)\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'pyarrow.lib.Schema' object has no attribute 'to_arrow_schema'\r\n```\r\nIf we check the type of the schema as defined above we get:\r\n```java\n\r\ntype(schema)\r\npyarrow.lib.Schema\n```\r\nBut the required type according with the docs is `pyarrow.parquet.Schema`, I don't know how to produce a object with this since we are forbbiden to use the Schema constructor directly.\r\n\r\nIf we check the implementation on github we get directly this line [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-0.15.1/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L1097):\r\n```java\n\r\ndataset_schema = self.schema.to_arrow_schema()\n```\r\nIs this a problem in the schema builder or the parquet dataset object?",
