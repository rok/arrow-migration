Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMost of the pieces are in place for this.  If a fragment has int32 and the dataset schema is int64 for example then the basic evolution strategy should be able to safely cast.\r\n\r\nWe might even consider supporting unsafe casts like int64 -> int32 if we can detect overflow and raise an error.",
