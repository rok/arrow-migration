Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe UCX server from ARROW-15706 will accept connections and put them into a queue to be handled. If they aren't handled quickly enough this can lead to a lot of clients stuck waiting for the server. The server should reject connections if too many pile up so the client can error or retry or connect to a different server. (This is a pitfall of gRPC/Java that we should avoid here.)",
