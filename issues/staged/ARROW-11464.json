        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11464](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11464). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `*pyarrow.parquet.read_pandas*`\u00a0[implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/816c23af4478fe28f31d474e90b433baeadb7a78/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L1740-L1754) doesn't conform to its [docs](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.parquet.read_pandas.html#pyarrow.parquet.read_pandas) in at least these ways:\r\n1. The docs state that a **`filesystem`** option can be provided, as it should be. Without this option I cannot read from S3, etc. The implementation, however, doesn't have this option! As such I currently cannot use it to read from S3!\n1. The docs (_not in the type definition!_) state that the default value for **`use_legacy_dataset`** is False, whereas the implementation has a value of True. Actually, however, if a value of True is used, then I can't read a partitioned dataset at all, so in this case maybe its the doc that needs to change to True.\n   \n   It looks to have been implemented and reviewed pretty carelessly.\n   \n   \u00a0",
