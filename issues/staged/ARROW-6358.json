Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn some situations, it can be desirable to delete the entirety of a directory's contents, but not the directory itself (e.g. when it's a S3 bucket). Perhaps we should add an option for that.",
