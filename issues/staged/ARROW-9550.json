        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9550](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9550). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe hasg aggregate operator runs on a thread and therefore does not require Rc<RefCell<_>> usage and could just use mutable references instead.\r\n\r\nThis does require some refactoring of the logic so that the code simply iterates over the rows, calling get_mut on the hashmap per row.",
