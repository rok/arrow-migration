Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the GDB plugin will print basic information about arrays:\r\n```Java\n\r\n(gdb) p int32_array\r\n$175 = arrow::Int32Array of length 4, null count 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to perhaps display a previsualization of the **data** contained in the array, at least for simple types.",
