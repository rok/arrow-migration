        "title": "[JS] Improve UTF8 decoding performance",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16117](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16117). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile profiling the performance of decoding TPC-H Customer and Part in-browser, datasets where there are a lot of UTF8s, it turned out that much of the time was being spent in\u00a0`getVariableWidthBytes`\u00a0rather than in\u00a0`TextDecoder`\u00a0itself. Ideally all the time should be spent in\u00a0`{}TextDecoder{`}.\r\n\r\nOn Chrome\u00a0`getVariableWidthBytes`\u00a0took up to ~15% of the e2e decoding latency, and on Safari it was close to ~40% (Safari's TextDecoder is much faster than Chrome's, so this took up relatively more time).\r\n\r\nThis is likely because the code in this PR is more amenable to V8/JSC's JIT, since\u00a0`x`\u00a0and\u00a0`y`\u00a0now are guaranteed to be SMIs (\"small integers\") instead of Object, allowing the JIT to emit efficient machine instructions that only deal in 32-bit integers. Once V8 discovers that a\u00a0`x`\u00a0and\u00a0`y`\u00a0can potentially be null (upon iterating past the bounds), it \"poisons\" the codepath forever, since it has to deal with the null case.\r\n\r\nSee this V8 post for a more in-depth explanation (in particular see the examples underneath \"Performance tips\"):\r\n<https://v8.dev/blog/elements-kinds>\r\n\r\nDoing the bounds check explicitly instead of implicitly basically eliminates this function from showing up in the profiling. Empirically, on my machine decoding TPC-H Part dropped from 1.9s to 1.7s on Chrome, and Customer dropped from 1.4s to 1.2s.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12793>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
