        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17355](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17355). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-15260, the utility functions for handling different kinds of reading errors (handle_parquet_io_error, handle_csv_read_error, and handle_augmented_field_misuse) were refactored so that multiple ones could be chained together. An issue with this is that other errors may be swallowed if they're used without any errors that they don't capture being raised manually afterwards.  We should update the code to prevent this from being possible.\r\n\r\n",
