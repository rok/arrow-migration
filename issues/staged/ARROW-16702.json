Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome operations we might implement:\r\n \\* `array_contains(arr, x)` : list array `arr` contains scalar `x`\r\n \\* `arrays_overlap(arr, sc)` : list array `arr` contains common elements in list scalar `sc` (could also impelement version with another array as second arg)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBoth Spark and postgres implement similar functions:\r\n \\* Spark: `arrays_overlap()` <https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.functions.arrays_overlap>\r\n \\* PostgreSQL `&&` operator <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-array.html>",
