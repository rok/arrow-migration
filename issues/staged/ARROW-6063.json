Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBoth sides on a DoPut should be able to half-close the stream, indicating they will no longer write. This allows a client to indicate that it is done writing data to the server, while still leaving the stream open so it can read metadata responses until the server finishes. Meanwhile, the server would see that the client has finished and be able to stop blocking on reading client messages.",
