Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf we want to remove KEYS from git we should do that separately. I see that Apache Ant (which is given as an example in the ASF guide to GPG security) has a KEYS file https://github.com/apache/ant/blob/master/KEYS. ",

I think this proves my point."

So, you check it against keys on a site you trust, namely apache.org. You should definitely not check your tar ball against the KEYS file in the tar ball!\n\nIn fact, my main reason to not include KEYS in the git repo is that it is easy for a release manager to accidentally include the KEYS file in the release. I'd say that https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/KEYS is reasonably secure, except that it hasn't necessarily been vetted by a release vote."
