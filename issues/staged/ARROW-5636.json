Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe expression cache in gandiva generates uses the ToString() method of arrow::DataType() for both hashing and equality.\r\n\r\nThis is error-prone - we should have a visitor for generating hash, and use the equality visitor for comparison.\r\n\r\n`[~fsaintjacques]` `[~praveenbingo]` \u00a0",
