As reported in https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2089#issuecomment-393126040 not everything is working yet. This may either be due to problems on our or PyPy's side.",

Conda-forge supports pypy for many packages, and I've been regularly working with Matti Picus (one of the PyPy core devs) to get stuff working when stuck. He mentioned this [patch](https://gist.github.com/mattip/c9c8398b58721ae5893dc8134c353f28) which he had at the time, as well as an old pypy-enabled [fork](https://github.com/bivald/pyarrow-on-pypy3). Perhaps that can serve as inspiration.\r\n\r\nI'm also willing to test any patches (or branches) against our PyPy infrastructure in conda-forge (if you tag me on GH, I will see things more quickly than here)."
