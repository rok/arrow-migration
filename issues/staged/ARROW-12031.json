Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter implementing fractional second parsing in and ARROW-9107 and ARROW-10337, no support for inference of subsecond timestamps was added (see [code]([https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/csv/inference_internal.h#L115), also mentioned in\u00a0ARROW-3738).\r\n\r\nThe [InferState logic \\| https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/81d6724546559fa8d6e85376a1cc339dab0506ad/cpp/src/arrow/csv/inference_internal.h#L63] could test for TimestampNS (with nanosecond resolution) after Timestamps with second resolution to not change existing inference results.\r\n\r\nWouldn't expect too much interest in trying to infer timestamps with milli- and microsecond resolution. The nanosecond resolution [can already parse ](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/81d6724546559fa8d6e85376a1cc339dab0506ad/cpp/src/arrow/util/value_parsing.h#L512-L518) the lower resolution ones.",
