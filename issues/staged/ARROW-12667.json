Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```python\n\r\nnparray = np.array([b\"ab\", b\"cd\", b\"ef\"])\r\narrow_array = pa.array(nparray[::2], pa.binary(2))\r\nassert [b\"ab\", b\"ef\"] == arrow_array.to_pylist()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe final result instead will be `[b'ab', b'cd']` which didn't deal correctly with the numpy array projection.",

I made a PR to add such a test."
