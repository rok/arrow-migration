Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would like to check our baseline modules with https://lvc.github.io/abi-compliance-checker/ to ensure that version upgrades are much smoother and that we don\u2018t break the ABI in patch releases. \r\n\r\nAs we\u2018re pre-1.0 yet, I accept that there will be breakage but I would like to keep them to a minimum. Currently the biggest pain with Arrow is you need to pin it in Python always with `==0.x.y`, otherwise segfaults are inevitable.",
