        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-19](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-19). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently memory allocations in the C++ implementation are all internal / self-contained, but in practice the array builders will need to integrate with some other memory allocator / tracker.\n\nI'll define a basic abstract memory pool interface and add an example default implementation (with a resizable arrow::Buffer subclass that requests memory from the pool) with all memory managed internally.",
