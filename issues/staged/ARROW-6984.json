        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6984](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6984). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a reported CVE\u00a0that\u00a0LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (More details in here -\u00a0<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17543> ). I see that Apache Arrow uses **v1.8.3** version ( <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/47e5ecafa72b70112a64a1174b29b9db45f803ef/cpp/thirdparty/versions.txt#L38>\u00a0).\r\n\r\nWe need to bump up the dependency version of LZ4 to **1.9.2** to get past the reported CVE. Thank you!",

Actually, in most systems, including the lz4 frame format and API, the bug is just out of reach.\r\n\r\n> since it also requires multiple uncommon constraints on the encoder side, which are out of direct control from an external actor (in contrast with the payload), this bug is rarely \"reachable\", making it a poor exploit vector.\r\n\r\nSo this doesn't sound mandatory for 0.15.1."
