We can make the test output, which is redirected to a file by `R CMD check`, more verbose, and we have an option in our Windows CI for doing that: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/.github/workflows/r.yml#L160-L168>\r\n\r\nBut that won't help debugging the failure on Azure because the check is hanging, so I don't think the build artifact will be generated in a way you could get it. But since this is a docker-compose job, one could do it locally/interactively and perhaps get some insight."
