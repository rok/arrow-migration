Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn Windows 10 Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044 `CpuInfo::CacheLevel` over reports the L-cache size:\r\n640K for L1\r\n10M for L2\r\nThese values are also reported by Windows resource monitor.\r\nIt seems that windows is reporting the total size of cache for each core aggregated as one value. Possibly due to \"intel smart cache\" cache sharing?\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\n\r\n[----------] 1 test from CpuInfo\r\n[ RUN      ] CpuInfo.Basic\r\nC:/tmp/arrow-verify-release/apache-arrow-9.0.0/cpp/src/arrow/util/io_util_test.cc(1036): error: Value of: l1 >= 4 * 1024 && l1 <= 512 * 1024\r\n  Actual: false\r\nExpected: true\r\nunexpected L1 size: 655360\r\n[  FAILED  ] CpuInfo.Basic (0 ms)\r\n[----------] 1 test from CpuInfo (0 ms total)\r\n```\r\n",
