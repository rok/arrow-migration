        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11061](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11061). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a problem when it comes to nested arrays, where one could create a <list[null]<primitive[non-null]>> where the array fields can't be null, but the list can have null slots.\r\n\r\nThis creates a lot of work when working with such nested arrays, because we have to create work-arounds to account for this, and take unnecessarily slower paths.\r\n\r\nI propose that we prevent this problem at the source, by:\r\n \\* checking that a batch can't be created with arrays that have incompatible null contracts\r\n \\* preventing list and struct children from being non-null if any descendant of such children are null (might be less of an issue for structs)",
