        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5908](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5908). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing RecordBatches using ArrowStreamWriter, if the ArrowBuffers being written aren't\u00a0all 8 byte aligned, the serialized RecordBatch won't conform to the Arrow specification. This leads to other languages' readers to throw an error when reading Arrow streams written by the C# writer.\r\n\r\nFor example, if reading\u00a0the stream from Python or C++, an error is raised here:\u00a0\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/f77c3427ca801597b572fb197b92b0133269049b/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/reader.cc#L107-L110>\r\n\r\nA similar error is raised when Java tries to read the stream.\r\n\r\nWe should be ensuring that the buffers being written to the stream are padded to 8 bytes, no matter their length, as specified in\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Layout.html#requirements-goals-and-non-goals>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n> - It is required to have all the contiguous memory buffers in an IPC payload aligned at 8-byte boundaries. In other words, each buffer must start at an aligned 8-byte offset. Additionally, each buffer should be padded to a multiple of 8 bytes.",
