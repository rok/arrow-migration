Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow doesn't yet support SIMD on arm architectures. SSE on ARM can be complicated, but there are a couple of libraries We could depend on, namely:\r\n- https://github.com/nemequ/simde (MIT)\n- https://github.com/catboost/catboost/tree/ee47f9aa399833cb04bfeec5fe9f3e3792d428e4/library/sse (Apache)",
