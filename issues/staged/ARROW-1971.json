Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`pyarrow.register_default_serialization_handlers(context)` does not include pandas serialization. We do not use the default Arrow context, so we are forced to call `_register_pandas_arrow_handlers` to register pandas correctly.\r\n",
