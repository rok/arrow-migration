        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16164](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16164). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the discussion on ARROW-15260, if we run the following code in R, we might expect it to push down the filter so we can just read in the relevant files:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n  filter = Expression$create(\r\n    \"match_substring\",\r\n    Expression$field_ref(\"__filename\"),\r\n    options = list(pattern = \"cyl=8\")\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by `[~westonpace]`:\r\n\r\n\"You might think we would get the hint and only read files matching that pattern. This is not the case. We will read the entire dataset and apply the \"cyl=8\" filter in memory.\r\n\r\nIf we want to pushdown filters on the filename column we will need to add some special logic.\"",

And something like regex on filename might be interesting.  However, I'm not terribly motivated to work on this because:\r\n\r\n \\* In the above example the user could establish a partitioning on `cyl` and then just filter for `cyl == 8`.\r\n \\* For more general filename filtering the user can often do this themselves by creating a dataset, getting the list of files, picking the files they want, and then creating a new dataset from the smaller list of files.\r\n\r\nSo it might be nice to first know of some key use cases that aren't solvable with other features."
