Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAccording to a recently published blog post [1] DataFuson is ~20x slower than Pandas for some simple queries against a tiny data set. I think it would be good to try and reproduce these results to understand why performance is so bad.\r\n\r\n\u00a0[1] https://towardsdatascience.com/data-processing-in-rust-with-datafusion-arrow-56df5432de68",
