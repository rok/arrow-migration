Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFUNC_RETURN_NOT_OK reconstructs a status object including line and status information.  This should be replaced with suitable methods from Status instead.   The macro is probably still useful since it returns by setting Status on the context instead of directly returning from a function",
