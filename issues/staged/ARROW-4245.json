Could someone take a look at [these example docs I wrote](https://github.com/apache/arrow/compare/master...paulkernfeld:arrow-4245-add-rustdoc-headers) to see if I'm going in the right direction?\u00a0 If they look good, I'm happy to add more. I deliberately added a lot of examples in the docs because I find that I'm personally a lot more likely to engage with a project if it has lots of examples."

This gives us the better review tools while everyone is aware that the work is not done yet."
