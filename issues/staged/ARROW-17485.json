Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe may want to create an uncompressed IPC file to share with JavaScript.\r\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/data-sources.html#file-attachments\r\n\r\nCurrently, to do this, we need to set up the following, but the string \"uncompressed\" is long and does not benefit from auto-completion by the IDE, making it difficult to write code.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\narrow::write_feather(mtcars, \"data.arrow\", compression = \"uncompressed\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to write the following.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\narrow::write_feather(mtcars, \"data.arrow\", compression = FALSE)\r\n```",
