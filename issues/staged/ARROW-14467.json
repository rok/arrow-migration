Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPME supports using the same encryption key for all columns, which is useful in a number of scenarios. However, misuse of this feature can break the NIST limit on the number of AES GCM operations with one key, as reported in PARQUET-2040. We will develop a limit-enforcing code and provide a Python API for uniform encryption, similarly to PARQUET-2040 and based on ARROW-9947.",
