However, constructing back the pandas dataframe fails.\r\n\r\nI initially realised that when doing a pd.read_parquet('example.parquet'), which fails with the same error.\r\n\r\nThis is using\r\npyarrow 0.11.1\r\npandas 0.23.4\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\ntimes = pd.to_datetime(['09:00', '09:30', '10:00', '10:30', '11:00', '11:30', '12:00']).time\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Time': [times]})\r\n\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\npq.write_table(table, 'example.parquet')\r\n\r\n# works\r\ntable2 = pq.read_table('example.parquet')\r\n\r\n# fails: ArrowNotImplementedError: Not implemented type for list in DataFrameBlock: time64[us]\r\ndf2 = pa.Table.to_pandas(table2)\r\n```",
