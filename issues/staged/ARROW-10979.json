        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10979](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10979). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIntroduce a basic Kafka reader based on `rdkafka`. Exposes an `Iterator` interface which yields `Result<RecordBatch>`. \r\n\r\nColumns in the batch are:\r\n\r\n**key** (Binary, nullable): The key of a message, if present.\r\n\r\n**payload** (Binary, nullable): The payload bytes of a message, if present.\r\n\r\n**topic** (Utf8): The topic of the message.\r\n\r\n**partition** (Int32): The partition of the message.\r\n\r\n**offset** (Int64): The offset of the message.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote that `rdkafka` has a C++ dependency (`librdkafka`), but we can choose to make this dynamically linked. `rdkafka` provides an `async` Consumer, but I have explicitly chosen the non-`async` Consumer.",
