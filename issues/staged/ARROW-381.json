Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the builder classes all expect to be passed a `shared_ptr<DataType>` \u2013 for the primitive types (boolean, numbers, strings, etc.) it would be simpler to default to a common value rather than requiring that you obtain an instance yourself from someplace (e.g. `arrow::uint8()` as in the WIP patch for ARROW-373)",
