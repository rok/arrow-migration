Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCombinationPredicate like And and Or only take two predicates: left and right. However, it often makes sense to combine more than two predicates. I suggest that `and` and `or` support arbitrarily many arguments. ",
