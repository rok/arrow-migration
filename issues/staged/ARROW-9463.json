Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe writer in the test case 'TestReadWrite' is double closed.\r\n```java\n\r\nw, err := NewWriter(f, recs[0].Schema())\r\nif err != nil {\r\n   t.Fatal(err)\r\n}\r\ndefer w.Close()     // <= Here\r\n\r\nfor i, rec := range recs {\r\n   err = w.Write(rec)\r\n   if err != nil {\r\n      t.Fatalf(\"could not write record[%d] to JSON: %v\", i, err)\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\nerr = w.Close()    // <= Here\r\nif err != nil {\r\n   t.Fatalf(\"could not close JSON writer: %v\", err)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe 'defer w.Close()' is redundant, which makes one more ']}' in the end of the output json file .\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
