        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15102](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15102). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nStructTypes can be created with types:\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\nstruct(x = int32(), y = utf8())\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut they cannot be created with fields yet. This means you cannot construct a StructType with a non-nullable field (since fields are nullable by default.) We should support constructing a StructType with fields, like we do for a Schema:\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\n# Schema from fields\r\nschema(field(\"x\", int32()), field(y, utf8(), nullable=FALSE))\r\n# Expected StructType from fields\r\nstruct(field(\"x\", int32()), field(y, utf8(), nullable=FALSE))\r\n```",
