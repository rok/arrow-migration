Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI fixed some -Wdocumentation issues in ARROW-4157 that showed up on one Linux distribution but not another, both with clang-6.0. Not sure why that is exactly, but it would be good to try to reproduce and see if our CI can be improved to catch these, or in worst case we could do it in one of our docker-compose builds",
