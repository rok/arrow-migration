Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen you land on the Arrow documentation you are probably looking how to use arrow, the number of people that will need arrow  to implement their own binding of it or provide custom support for the arrow format are probably going to be an important but less frequent use case.\r\n\r\nWe should probably make the \"Libraries\" section the entry point of the documentation so that one can immediately go to the language they care about (and maybe give it a naming that is easier to put in context for the reader like \"Supported Languages\").\r\n\r\nThe \"SPECIFICATIONS AND PROTOCOLS\" section instead can come after.\r\n\r\nIt's mostly just a matter of reordering a bit the topics.",
