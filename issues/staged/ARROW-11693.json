Having a proper UTF8 string length kernel would indeed be good (also needed for pandas' string methods)."

Consider invalid bytes, invalid continuation bytes, invalid sequence, etc. utf8proc decodes taking into consideration these cases: https://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/blob/master/utf8proc.c#L124-L171"
