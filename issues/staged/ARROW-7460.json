Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn a comment to an open ticket for optimising a cast kernel by using SIMD, `[~andy-thomason]` \u00a0mentioned that LLVM does autovec well for Rust.\r\n\r\nI'd like to explore whether we could improve the kernel performance by simplifying the loops enough to allow the compiler to vectorise.",
