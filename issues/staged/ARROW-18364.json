        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18364](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18364). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe [GitHub issue creation page for Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/new/choose) directs users to open bug reports in Jira. Now that ASF Infra has disabled self-service registration in Jira, and in light of the pending migration of Apache Arrow issue tracking from ASF Jira to GitHub issues, we should enable bug reports to be submitted via GitHub directly. Issue templates will help distinguish bug reports and feature requests from existing usage assistance questions.",
