        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1089](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1089). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor Arrow streams with unknown size, it would be useful to be able to write the data to disk either as a stream or as the file format (for random access) with minimal overhead; i.e. we would avoid record batch IPC loading and write the raw messages directly to disk",
