        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12602). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the C++ library there is arrow::BuildInfo and arrow::GetBuildInfo which provides captures some information from the build that created the library.\u00a0 Some of this we may want to add to R.\r\n\r\nC++ library version -> Yes.\u00a0 Should be lockstep with the R version but couldn't hurt and may not match during custom builds.\r\nC++ SO version -> No.\u00a0 I don't know enough about this to know how it differs from the library version and it seems it would be more confusing than helpful.\r\n\r\nC++ compiler info -> Yes.\u00a0 The compiler ID and compiler flags should again be pretty standard if obtained from CRAN but could be useful for custom builds.\r\n\r\nC++ package kind -> No. This is useful in python where there is a distinction (pypi vs conda) but I don't think it would have a meaningful value in R.",
