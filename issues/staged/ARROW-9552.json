Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt is important for users to be able to debug query performance and each operator is capable of collecting important metrics, like # of input and output batches and rows, as well as elapsed time spent doing different types of processing.\r\n\r\nWe should design traits for metrics reporting so that other projects using DataFusion can access these metrics and make them available for users to see.",
