Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGiven the recent parquet compat problems, we should have better testing for this.\r\n\r\nFor easy testing of backwards compatibility, we could add some files (with different types) written with older versions, and ensure they are read correctly with the current version.\r\n\r\nSimilarly as what Kartothek is doing: https://github.com/JDASoftwareGroup/kartothek/tree/master/reference-data/arrow-compat\r\n\r\nAn easy way would be to do that in pyarrow and add them to /pyarrow/tests/data/parquet (we already have some files from 0.7 there).
