I'll add `ARROW_PYTHON` back but we should not use `ARROW_PYTHON=ON` in the `verify-release-candidate.sh`.\r\n\r\nBecause the `ARROW_PYTHON` dependencies are inconsistent. For example, they include `ARROW_DATASET=ON` but it's an optional component (not a required component) in PyArrow. And they don't include all optional components such as `ARROW_PARQUET=ON`.\r\n\r\nI think that CMake presets will be better replacement for `ARROW_PYTHON` because we can define multiple presets such as `features-python-minimum` and `features-python-maximum`. But CMake presets require CMake 3.19 or later..."
