Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI proposed this ages ago in https://lists.apache.org/thread/xpn9gyrs6kqc3g9t8k4ts8dmy7yyxskq and am finally getting around to implementing it.\r\n\r\nI propose to add ordering information to exec nodes (mostly for node validation) and indices to exec batches.  This is a fundamental step to allow nodes to consume this ordering information to achieve features such as ARROW-10883 and ARROW-16628.  It also can replace the complicated batch enumeration in the current scanner to support in-order table reassembly.",
