Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the `list_parent_indices` output type is the input list offset type. But that doesn't really make sense: the parent indices are simply indices in the list array, they are not bounded by the offset size (even a list array with 32-bit offsets can have a length larger than 2\\*\\*32, for example if it's mostly nulls).",

I suppose FixedSizeList is another case of that, where I think I set it at int32_t but it should be int64_t."
