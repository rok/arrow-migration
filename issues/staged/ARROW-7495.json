Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith the introduction of ReferenceManager in the codebase, the need for a separate ArrowBuf is no longer necessary. Instead, once can create a new reference manager that is used for the empty ArrowBuf. For reminder/review, empty arrowbufs have a special behavior in that they don't actually have any reference counting semantics and always stay at one. This allow us to better troubleshoot unallocated memory than what would otherwise be an NPE after calling ValueVector.clear()",
