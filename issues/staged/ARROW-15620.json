Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Substrait spec defines a few types that are not supported by Apache arrow.  These are currently implemented as extension types but there will be no compute support for them.  We have compute support for the underlying storage type and should expose the relevant functions as appropriate.  The extension types are:\r\n\r\n \\* UUID\r\n \\* Fixed length string\r\n \\* Varchar",
