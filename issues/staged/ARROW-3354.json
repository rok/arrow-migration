Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, we have the following signatures:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\npa.read_record_batch(obj, Schema schema)\r\npa.cuda.read_record_batch(object schema, object buffer, pool=None)\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI suggest swapping the first two arguments in pa.cuda.read_record_batch.",
