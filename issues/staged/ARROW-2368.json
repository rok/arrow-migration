Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf the input given is less than 16 bytes, we pad zero for the remaining bytes [1]. This is not correct if the value is a negative number. We should pad 0x00 or 0xFF depending upon the number is a positive or negative number. Later when the value is retrieved we end up with an incorrect value.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[1]\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/DecimalVector.java#L231",
