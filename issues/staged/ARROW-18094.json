        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18094](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18094). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe use `nightly-*` groups not `nightly` group for our nightly CI.\r\nSo we need to use `crossbow submit -g nightly-tests -g nightly-packaging -g nightly-release` to run nightly jobs when we want to run nightly jobs before we merge a pull request.\r\nBut it's inconvenient and easy to mistake. For example, some developers use `crossbow submit -g nightly` to run nightly jobs.\r\n\r\nHow about make `nightly` group as an alias of `nightly-*` groups to improve developer experience?",
