        "title": "pytz required by pyarrow but not included in package metadata requirements.",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15966](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15966). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyarrow raises a ModuleNotFoundError for pytz when a timestamped timezone is used. However, pytz is not included in the pyarrow package metadata as a standard requirement or an extra.\r\n\r\nPyarrow Version: 7.0.0\r\nPython Version: 3.10.2\r\nOS Version: macOS 12.3\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce.\r\n\r\n1. Create a clean environment. I use pyenv but there are lots of ways to get to the same result. As long as you are using something deterministic and not something like conda you get the idea.\r\n```java\n\r\npyenv virtualenv 3.10.2 pyarrow_test_env \r\npyenv activate pyarrow_test_env\n```\r\n2. Install pyarrow.\r\n```java\n\r\npip install pyarrow\n```\r\n3. Create a table with a datetime with a timezone.\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> import pyarrow\r\n>>> from datetime import datetime\r\n>>> from datetime import timezone \r\n>>> pyarrow.table({\"my_time\": [datetime(2022,1,1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)]}) Traceback (most recent call last): \u00a0 File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> \u00a0 File \"pyarrow/table.pxi\", line 2577, in pyarrow.lib.table \u00a0 File \"pyarrow/table.pxi\", line 1868, in pyarrow.lib.Table.from_pydict \u00a0 File \"pyarrow/table.pxi\", line 2658, in pyarrow.lib._from_pydict \u00a0 File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 342, in pyarrow.lib.asarray \u00a0 File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 316, in pyarrow.lib.array \u00a0 File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 39, in pyarrow.lib._sequence_to_array \u00a0 File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 143, in pyarrow.lib.pyarrow_internal_check_status ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytz'\n```\r\n\r\nThe only package required by pyarrow is numpy. There are no extra requirements defined. If there are optional extras they should be defined in the package metadata (e.g. setup.py extras_require).",

However, I think that this issue probably captures more detail. I notice that in ARROW-15580 [~jorisvdb_impala_6b3d]\u00a0 was asking for an example with more detail like we have here. I could copy the contents of this issue into the comments of ARROW-15580 if that is helpful."
