Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn rust/README.md,\u00a0 both\u00a0**ARROW_TEST_DATA**\u00a0and\u00a0**PARQUET_TEST_DATA** are set as relative path. The problem is: we MAY have to reset them\u00a0back-and-forth across top and subdirectories \u2013 that's annoying. So, the obvious solution is: set the Env vars as absolute dirs.",
