Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo improve readability I suggest splitting `builder.cc` into independent compilation units. Concrete builder classes are generally independent of each other. The only concern is whether inlining some of the base class implementations is important for performance.\r\n\r\nThis would also make incremental compilation faster when changing one of the concrete classes.",

I think it could be useful to have a subdirectory to collect implementation h / cc files. This could be called columnar / or array/ or similar. "
