Does your environment have miniconda / Anaconda installed? See https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/travis_install_conda.sh#L20. I'm afraid I'm limited in the amount of support I can provide, I suggest you seek further help on the dev@ mailing list"

I say \"possibly\" because it really depends what you need. For instance:\r\n\r\nOnly one `conda create ...` command is required.\r\n\r\nOnly one `conda activate ...` command is required.\r\n\r\nIs the aim to build pyarrow from source and just use it?\r\n If yes, then you don't need `make format` as well as `-DCLANG_FORMAT_BIN=..` in cmake. I am sure that some of the packages listed in `conda install ...` command are not required.\r\n Also, then you would not need to use `python setup.py ... develop`, just replace `develop` with `install` here.\r\n\r\nDo you need numba.cuda support?\r\n If not, then you don't need to define `NUMBAPRO_..` environment variables.\r\n\r\nI think the most important parts for installing pyarrow with cuda support are:\r\n Use `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX` when in conda environment. Otherwise, use different prefix or default might be fine.\r\n Usage of\u00a0\u00a0`-DARROW_PYTHON=on -DARROW_CUDA=on` in cmake and `python setup.py build_ext --with-cuda ...`\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to make conda command available to your gist."
