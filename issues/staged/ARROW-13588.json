        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13588). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDate-times in the POSIXct format have a 'tzone' attribute that by default is set to \"\", an empty character vector (not NULL) when created.\r\n\r\nThis however is not stored in the Arrow feather file. When the file is read back, the original and restored dataframes are not identical as per the below reprex.\r\n\r\nI am thinking that this should not be the intention? My workaround at the moment is making a check when reading back to write the empty string if the tzone attribute does not exist.\r\n\r\nJust to confirm, the attribute is stored correctly when it is not empty.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n```java\n\r\n``` r\r\n dates <- as.POSIXct(c(\"2020-01-01\", \"2020-01-02\", \"2020-01-02\"))\r\n attributes(dates)\r\n #> $class\r\n #> [1] \"POSIXct\" \"POSIXt\" \r\n #> \r\n #> $tzone\r\n #> [1] \"\"\r\n\r\n values <- c(1:3)\r\n original <- data.frame(dates, values)\r\n original\r\n #> dates values\r\n #> 1 2020-01-01 1\r\n #> 2 2020-01-02 2\r\n #> 3 2020-01-02 3\r\n\r\ntempfile <- tempfile()\r\narrow::write_feather(original, tempfile)\r\n\r\nrestored <- arrow::read_feather(tempfile)\r\n\r\nidentical(original, restored)\r\n #> [1] FALSE\r\n\r\n waldo::compare(original, restored)\r\n #> `attr(old$dates, 'tzone')` is a character vector ('')\r\n #> `attr(new$dates, 'tzone')` is absent\r\n\r\nunlink(tempfile)\r\n ```\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",

Provided that there is no different meaning of `tzone = NULL` from `tzone = \"\"` in R, we can handle this field specially on the round trip. "

In R, the empty character vector \"\" is different to NULL. An R attribute cannot be stored as NULL - setting an attribute to NULL removes it.\r\n\r\nThe wider issue is that although you _can_ remove the tzone attribute for dates, certain object classes (including those popular for time series e.g. 'xts') _require_ the tzone attribute to be set."
