        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6893](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6893). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe APT repos hosted on bintray at <https://dl.bintray.com/apache/arrow/>\u00a0appear to have been recently updated and no longer have package metadata for versions prior to 0.15.0. The actual deb packages appear to still be present in the pool (i.e. for Ubuntu bionic they are in <https://apache.bintray.com/arrow/ubuntu/pool/bionic/main/a/apache-arrow/)>\u00a0but the binary Packages list <https://apache.bintray.com/arrow/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/binary-amd64/Packages>\u00a0only contains entries for version 0.15.0\r\n\r\nFor operational reasons, we wish to remain pinned to version 0.14.x for the time being, but our test jobs which are pinned to install 0.14 packages have now started failing because of this missing metadata.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCan the packages list be restored so that all of the versions present in the repo are supported?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
