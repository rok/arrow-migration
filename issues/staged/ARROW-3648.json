Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent Arrow Java Plasma client has no API to get the metadata and data together in one API call. If we split this process into two API calls, the object status could be different. Current observation shows that the first call could be empty(object not stored yet) while the second call will success but the metadata and data does not match.\r\n",
