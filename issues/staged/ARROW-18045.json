It seems that your machine uses `armhl` Debian architecture.\r\n\r\nWe provide deb packages for `arm64` but not for `armhl`. If you use an `arm64` based Ubuntu https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm , you can use our deb packages.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep using `armhl`, you need to build Apache Arrow C++ manually before you install PyArrow. See https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/building.html for details. You need to specify at least `-DARROW_PYTHON=ON` CMake option."
