Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen the null count of a Field is 0 the validity buffer is optional in a RecordBatch message. From ARROW-1476, integration tests were failing because of this (see discussion here https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1316#issuecomment-344439955). The failure occurred due to chance of the random seed for generating the validity buffer. We should explicitly test this case for integration testing in the future.",
