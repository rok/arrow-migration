I have replicated this on ubuntu 20.04 and while it does solve the environment at some point it takes a very long time (>1h), which is of course not acceptable. I don't know why this happens but will look into it, even if there is a fix we probably want to update the docs..."

(\"https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/__linux__/focal/latest\")? This is will always give you the newest version. If you want to pin a certain version you can check the RSPM docs on how to create a time stamped link. (But I would probably rather use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) or [conda-lock](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/conda-lock) if you require a reproducible environment.)\r\n\r\n> I've also gotten it to work with the 'nightly' version hosted on Apache.  The compilation is much slower than the RStudio instructions\r\n\r\nYes while we have pre-compiled libarrow binaries and a script that detects which one matches you distro best, we still need to compile the actual R package which takes ~5 minutes. While RSPM (PPM soon :D) supplies package binaries that don't require any compilation. An important note in regards to the nightlies: these are 100% brittle as we only ever keep 14 versions/days around and delete everything else. So if you require reproducibility I would advise against using them.\r\n\r\nI have talked to some conda-forge users and they all recommend using [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) when using conda-forge packages as it has a much faster solver. Something that might need to be added to the docs."
