Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNormally, users remove build directory after they installed.\r\nIf users remove build directory, Gandiva doesn't work.\r\n\r\nIt's better that we install `irhelpers.bc` and use it by default. We can use `irhelpers.bc` in build directory only when we run tests. I think that test programs use `Gandiva::Configuration` that refers `irhelpers.bc` in build directory instead of the default `Gandiva::Configuration`.",
