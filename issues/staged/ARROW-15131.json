        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15131](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15131). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSmall example I ran into:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> arr = pa.array(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])\r\n>>> pc.is_in(arr, ['a', 'c'])\r\n...\r\nTypeError: \"['a', 'c']\" is not a valid value set\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's not a super friendly error message (it was not directly clear what is not \"valid\" about this). Passing `pa.array(['a', 'c'])` explicitly works, but I expected that the kernel would try this automatically (as we also convert the first array argument to an array).",
