Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf there is a type error, ArrayFromJSON returns an error message like \"Invalid: Expected unsigned int or null, got JSON type 4\", where JSON type 4 is a value of type rapidjson::Type enum. It is better to print type names rather than enum values such as \"Invalid: Expected unsigned int or null, got JSON type array\".",
