I'm commenting rather than making a JIRA issue because I have no idea whether these are actual issues or just a newbie's lack of knowledge. Running <font color=\"#654982\">`dev/gen_apidocs.sh`</font> on a clean pull with my single line to <font color=\"#654982\">`api.rst`</font> changed failed:\r\n\r\nThe <font color=\"#654982\">`iwyu`</font> image in <font color=\"#654982\">`dev/docker-compose.yml`</font> failed with this path issue:\r\n     - <font color=\"#654982\">`ERROR: build path <my-path>/arrow/dev/iwyu either does not exist, is not accessible, or is not a valid URL.`</font>\r\n     - I commented it out and then could continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Java docs wouldn't compile either at first:\r\n    - I think because there's a <font color=\"#654982\">`conda install`</font> for a second version of <font color=\"#654982\">`maven`</font> below the <font color=\"#654982\">`apt-get install maven`</font> in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/gen_apidocs/Dockerfile), which puts Java 11 in the front of the <font color=\"#654982\">`PATH`</font> breaking the lookup for class <font color=\"#654982\">`javax.annotation.Generated`</font> which moves from [Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/Generated.html) to [Java 9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Generated.html) (and here is where it landed in [Java 11](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.compiler/javax/annotation/processing/Generated.html))\r\n    - when I deleted that line in the Dockerfile, the Java code compiled but didn't pass a test, because of a different missing dependency (that I didn't note; happy to figure it out if it's actually meaningful)\r\n    - so I commented out the Java build section in <font color=\"#654982\">`dev/gen_apidocs/create_documents.sh`</font>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Javascript docs failed on a dependency I didn't note (happy to; just didn't want to waste time if it's my noob problem)\r\n     - so I commented it out too; then the remaining doc generation worked\r\n\r\nPlease disregard if it's my lack of understanding. Otherwise I am happy to investigate further/add issues :)."
