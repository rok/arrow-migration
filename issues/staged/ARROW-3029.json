Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImporting and calling `pkg_resources` at pyarrow import time to get the version number is slow (around 200 ms. here, out of 640 ms. total for importing pyarrow).\r\n\r\nInstead we could generate a version file, which seems possible using `setuptools_scm`'s `write_to` parameter: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/#configuration-parameters\r\n",
