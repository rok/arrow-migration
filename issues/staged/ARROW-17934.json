Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-15260 I get the folder `tests/testthat/another_dataset` leftover after running `devtools::test()`. Maybe we should use a tempfile for this instead just in case the write to the working directory gets picked up by CRAN?",
