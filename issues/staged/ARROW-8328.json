        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8328](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8328). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe provide [warning-disabling flags to MSVC](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/72433c6/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L151-L153) including one which should disable all conversion warnings. However this is not completely effectual and Appveyor will still emit conversion warnings (which are then treated as errors), requiring insertion of otherwise unnecessary explicit casts or `#pragma`s (for example https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6820 ).\r\n\r\nPerhaps flag ordering is significant? In any case, as we have conversion warnings disabled for other compilers we should ensure they are completely disabled for MSVC as well.",
