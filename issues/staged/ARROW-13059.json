        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13059](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13059). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd to / adapt the code that `archery crossbow` already uses to send the email report to also save the status of the builds to a json file and commit that to a new branch in the crossbow (or some other ursacomputing repository)\r\n\r\nCrossbow code (hint this is the code that you will want to copy + adapt to do this new task): https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/archery/archery/crossbow/reports.py\r\n\r\nThis is how the nightly jobs are triggered: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/blob/master/.github/workflows/nightly_report.yml\r\n(note that it [figures out what the job id](https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/blob/master/.github/workflows/nightly_report.yml#L33-L34) is and then it runs a command `archery crossbow report ...`\r\n\r\nThe archer CLI interface is specifiedin https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/archery/archery/crossbow/cli.py\r\n\r\nUltimately what we want is something like: a new command like `crossbow archery save-report-data` that uses similar code/approaches to how the report is designed but saves the data to json (or line delimited json) and saves that somewhere reliable (i.e. the ursacomputing/crossbow repository or a new repository under ursacomputing)",
