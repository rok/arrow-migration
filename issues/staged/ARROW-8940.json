        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8940](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8940). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the past, we run integration tests from main methods, and recently, we have changed this to run them by the failsafe plugin. \r\n\r\nThis is a good change, but it also leads to significant performance degradation. In the past, it took about 10s to run `ITTestLargeVector#testLargeDecimalVector`, now it takes more than half an hour. \r\n\r\nOur investigation shows that the problem was caused by calling `HistoricalLog#recordEvent` repeatedly. This method is called only when `BaseAllocator#DEBUG` is enabled. In a unit/integration test, the flag is enabled by default. \r\n\r\nWe solve the problem with the following steps:\r\n1. We set system property to disable the `BaseAllocator#DEBUG` flag.\r\n2. We change the logic so that the system property takes precedence over the `AssertionUtil#isAssertionsEnabled` method. \r\n\r\nThis makes the integration tests as fast as before. ",
