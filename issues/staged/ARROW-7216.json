Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSetting/clearing individual bits are key operations for Arrow. In this issue, we improve the performance these operations by:\r\n\r\n1. replacing arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations\r\n2. remove unnecessary casts between int/byte\r\n3. provide new API to remove the if branch\r\n\r\nBenchmark results show that for clearing a bit, the performance improve by 11%, and for general set/clear operation, the performance improve by 4.7%:\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\nBitVectorHelperBenchmarks.setValidityBitBenchmark        avgt    5  4.524 \u00b1 0.015  us/op\r\n\r\nafter:\r\nBitVectorHelperBenchmarks.setValidityBitBenchmark        avgt    5  4.313 \u00b1 0.011  us/op\r\nBitVectorHelperBenchmarks.setValidityBitToZeroBenchmark  avgt    5  4.020 \u00b1 0.016  us/op\r\n\r\n",
