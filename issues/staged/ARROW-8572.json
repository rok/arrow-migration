        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8572](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8572). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in Python, you can construct a UnionArray easily, but getting the data back out (without copying) is near-impossible. We should expose the getter for UnionArray.array so we can pull out the constituent arrays. We should also expose fields like mode while we're at it.\r\n\r\nThe use case is: in Flight, we'd like to write multiple distinct datasets (with distinct schemas) in a single logical call; using UnionArrays lets us combine these datasets into a single logical dataset.",
