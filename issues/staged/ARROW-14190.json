If schemas with different (but compatible) types are combined using `open_dataset()`, this works, whereas if done via `unify_schemas()`, it results in an error.\r\n\r\nSee discussion here: https://github.com/apache/arrow-cookbook/pull/67#discussion_r714847220\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\n\r\n# Set up schemas\r\nschema1 = schema(speed = int32(), dist = int32())\r\nschema2 = schema(speed = float64(), dist = float64())\r\n\r\n# Try to combine schemas via `unify_schemas()` - results in an error\r\nunify_schemas(schema1, schema2)\r\n## Error: Invalid: Unable to merge: Field speed has incompatible types: int32 vs double\r\n## /home/nic2/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/type.cc:1609  fields_[i]->MergeWith(field)\r\n## /home/nic2/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/type.cc:1672  AddField(field)\r\n## /home/nic2/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/type.cc:1743  builder.AddSchema(schema)\r\n\r\n# Create datasets with different schemas and read in via `open_dataset()`\r\ncars1 <- Table$create(slice(cars, 1:25), schema = schema1)\r\ncars2 <- Table$create(slice(cars, 26:50), schema = schema2)\r\n\r\ntd <- tempfile()\r\ndir.create(td)\r\n\r\nwrite_parquet(cars1, paste0(td, \"/cars1.parquet\"))\r\nwrite_parquet(cars2, paste0(td, \"/cars2.parquet\"))\r\n\r\nnew_dataset <- open_dataset(td) \r\n\r\nnew_dataset$schema\r\n# Schema\r\n# speed: int32\r\n# dist: int32\r\n# \r\n# See $metadata for additional Schema metadata\r\n```\r\n",

You could pass unify_schemas = TRUE to it and would probably get the error. "

I thought we already had this kind of schema evolution enabled when explicitly unifying the schema, and not only when implicitly casting to the schema of the first file."
