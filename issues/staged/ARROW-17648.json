Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen converting from an Acero plan to a Substrait plan not all scan options are fully supported.  The `projection` (partial column selection) and `filter` (pushdown filtering) support needs to be added.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nResult<std::unique_ptr<substrait::ReadRel>> ScanRelationConverter(const std::shared_ptr<Schema>& schema, const compute::Declaration& declaration,    ExtensionSet* ext_set, const ConversionOptions& conversion_options) {  \r\n\r\nauto read_rel = make_unique<substrait::ReadRel>();\r\nconst auto& scan_node_options = checked_cast<const dataset::ScanNodeOptions&>(*declaration.options);  \r\nauto dataset = dynamic_cast<dataset::FileSystemDataset*>(scan_node_options.dataset.get()); \r\n// TODO handle here\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

I have a doubt if we can support this feature. Would appreciate your thoughts on this?"
