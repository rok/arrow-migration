        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10911](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10911). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8908#issuecomment-744780934\r\n\r\n> > This change also renamed our Boost dependency name to \"Boost\" from\n> \"BOOST\". It means that users need to use -DBoost_SOURCE not\n> -DBOOST_SOURCE. To keep backward compatibility, -DBOOST_SOURCE is\n> still accepted when -DBoost_SOURCE isn't specified.\n> \n> > Users also need to use -Dre2_SOURCE not -DRE2_SOURCE. To keep backward\n> compatibility, -DRE2_SOURCE is still accepted when -Dre2_SOURCE isn't\n> specified.\n> \n> I would love to have this kind of case-insensitive handling for all dependencies. This has tripped me up many times and it is difficult to explain to others why everything else is ALL_CAPS but these dependencies are a mix.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8908#issuecomment-744898897\r\n\r\n> OK. How about using `ARROW_${UPPERCASE_DEPENDENCY_NAME}_SOURCE` CMake variables for them like `ARROW_\\*_USE_SHARED`?\n> \n> If it sounds reasonable, we can work on it as a separated task.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8908#issuecomment-744954917\r\n\r\n> Why does it need the `ARROW_` namespace prefix?\n> \n> I'm fine with anything that is intuitive and trivial to document.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8908#issuecomment-745005158\r\n\r\n> Because of consistency.\n> If we use `ARROW_${UPPERCASE_DEPENDENCY_NAME}_SOURCE` not `${UPPERCASE_DEPENDENCY_NAME}_SOURCE`,  we can explain that you can customize how to use `${DEPENDENCY}` by `ARROW_${UPPERCASE_DEPENDENCY_NAME}_{SOURCE,USE_SHARED}` CMake variables. It'll more intuitive than using `${UPPERCASE_DEPENDENCY_NAME}_SOURCE` and `ARROW_${UPPERCASE_DEPENDENCY_NAME}_USE_SHARED`.",

I don't have a strong preference regarding the uppercasing but the `ARROW_` prefix is important to separate it from variables that are used in the `Find*.cmake` scripts."
