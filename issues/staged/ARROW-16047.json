Might be a bit of time before I can allocate the time, but will assign myself when I'm able to start.\r\n\r\nJust for clarification on the issue title (and to ensure I understand it correctly)... the current behaviour of `match_substring` and `match_substring_regex` is to return `NULL` for `NULL` inputs, and the option would be to allow changing that behaviour so that they can return `false`?"
