        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13219). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCompareOptions is not properly a FunctionOptions but it has bindings in GLib that expect it to be a FunctionOptions. After ARROW-13025, we should make CompareOptions a bare struct (instead of a FunctionOptions subclass) and deprecate it in favor of just specifying the comparison operator directly.",
