Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `CategoricalBlock` was removed in pandas (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/40527), which breaks the nightly tests. \r\n\r\nI will argue in pandas to add it back on the short term (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/40226#issuecomment-804903010), but we should still remove the direct use of those Block subclasses in pyarrow.",
