        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11789). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn an upcoming version of readr, `read_csv()` and friends will support vectors of multiple file paths. Consider adding support for this to the `arrow::read_*()` functions. In the `as_data_frame = FALSE` case, consider\u00a0whether the result should be a Table or a Dataset and whether the user should be offered a choice of which, and if Dataset, consider whether there should be options for partitioning.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we might add support for vectors of multiple file paths to `arrow::open_dataset()`, and note in the\u00a0`read_*()` function docs to use `open_dataset()` for this purpose.",
