        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17652](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17652). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe use EC2 machines to read parquet datasets from S3. One user has a problem with getting this to work. The initial issue was trying to read parquet files from S3 failed, with what looked like an AWS credentials error:\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\nError: IOError: When getting information for key 'X' in bucket 'Y': AWS Error [code 15]: No response body.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe AWS CLI doesn't have a permissions problem, nor does the `pyarrow` package in Python, and neither do other packages in R (eg `paws`). I assumed it was to do with not having a full install of the Arrow package with S3 support. Trying a few different versions of reinstalling from source all failed at a stage building Thrift, which in turn seemed to be related to not finding Boost libraries \u2013 see the attached error log.\r\n\r\nUsual approach we use, which worked on other machines\r\n```R\n\r\nSys.setenv(\"LIBARROW_MINIMAL\" = FALSE)\r\ninstall.packages(\"arrow\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTrying to use an Arrow binary, I think probably not the right way, and it's just falling back to building from source.\r\n```R\n\r\nSys.setenv(\"LIBARROW_BINARY\" = TRUE) # I'm not sure this is actually the correct use\r\nSys.setenv(\"LIBARROW_MINIMAL\" = FALSE)\r\ninstall.packages(\"arrow\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing some advice in another issue I now can't find, I tried specifying the compilers\r\n```R\n\r\nSys.setenv(CC=\"/usr/bin/gcc\")\r\nSys.setenv(CXX=\"/usr/bin/g++\")\r\nSys.setenv(LIBARROW_MINIMAL=\"FALSE\")\r\nSys.setenv(LIBARROW_BINARY=\"FALSE\")\r\nSys.setenv(ARROW_R_DEV=\"TRUE\")\r\ninstall.packages(\"arrow\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've also tried getting the missing dependencies from `yum`:\r\n\r\n```sh\n\r\nyum install -y libcurl-devel\r\nyum install -y openssl-devel\r\nyum install -y thrift\r\nyum install -y boost boost-thread boost-devel\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut are still failing at the same point.\r\n\r\nIf we install from the RSPM repo for Centos7 (We're running Amazon Linux 2), the package installs seemingly happily but we still have the AWS Error message when trying to read from an S3 bucket.",
