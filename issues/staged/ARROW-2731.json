Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOrc is currently vendored in the Arrow build.\u00a0 The CMake vendoring is a headache for downstream packagers (like Anaconda) because when there are build problems, we can't directly patch the vendored package.\u00a0 We would like to add the option to use external Orc where possible - as it already is for most of the other third-party libraries",
