Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI don't believe this is meant to be internal.\u00a0 pyarrow.parquet.write_to_dataset uses this (if use_legacy_dataset=False) but the parquet API doesn't expose the same features.\u00a0 A new example should also probably be added to the Tabular Datasets section of the docs explaining why write_dataset can take in a scanner (e.g. memory preserving, ability to write a dataset from flight or any record batch source, etc.)",
