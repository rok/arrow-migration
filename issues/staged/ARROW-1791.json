Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe integration tests are generating random int32 values, but for systems that use millisecond-based date objects (like JavaScript), converting to millisecond date will cause an overflow in a lot of cases. We should generate values that are within a reasonable year range so that overflows when converting to milliseconds do not occur",
