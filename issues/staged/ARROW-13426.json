        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13426](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13426). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the JIT code generation / function invocation in Gandiva uses `int64` for pointer types.\r\n\r\nThis breaks especially when indexing into pointers to pointers on platforms where the pointer size is not 64 bit wide.\r\n\r\nTo represent opaque pointers, void\\* (or i8\\* in LLVM) should be used where suitable.",
