Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7033 does not add ConvertOptions (including alternate spellings for null/true/false, etc) or ReadOptions (block_size, column name customization, etc). These will be helpful but will require some discussion to find the optimal way to integrate them with dataset::",

ReadOptions doesn't fit neatly into either the dataset-global or scan-specific buckets (skip_rows, column names are in the former; block_size is in the latter) so fields will have to be inlined (or it could be made part of CsvFileFormat with an explicit block_size field in CsvFragmentScanOptions).\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'll also plumb through the options into Python and add a ScannerBuilder method for setting them."
