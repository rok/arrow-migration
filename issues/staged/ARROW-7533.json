Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe memory package is focused on memory access and management. ArrowBufPointer should be moved to algorithm package as it isn't core to the Arrow memory management primitives. I would further suggest that is an anti-pattern.",

In particular, we have the following method in vector API:\r\n\r\n`ArrowBufPointer getDataPointer(int index);`\r\n\r\nIf we move it to the algorithm package, there will be the problem of cyclic dependency. \r\nCan we move it to the vector package instead?"
