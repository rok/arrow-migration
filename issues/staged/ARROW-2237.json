Here, `echo 20000 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages` swaps wildly as it seems to evict existing normal pages to make place for huge pages (am I analyzing this right?). This is using a `4.13.0` kernel on a 16GB RAM machine.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, yes, configuring `/proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group` and `/proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages` and fixing the test to use `/dev/hugepages` makes it pass here. I wonder if there's a way to skip it or otherwise give better directions if hugepages support isn't usable on the system."
