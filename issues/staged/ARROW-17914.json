        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17914](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17914). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nC++ supports `IpcReadOptions.included_fields` which lets you load a subset of (top-level) fields from an IPC file or stream, potentially saving on I/O costs. It would be useful to support this in Java as well. Some refactoring would be required since MessageSerializer currently reads record batch messages in as a whole, and it would be good to quantify how much of a benefit this provides in different scenarios.",
