I'm not sure what a good way is to clear that cache.  All builds seem to be using s3fs@2021.7.0 but the failing builds are using aiobotocore@1.4.0 (which released recently) and the passing builds are using aiobotocore@1.3.3.  We could put `s3fs >= 2021.8.0` which should resolve the issue but it might be overkill.  I'll make a PR for that and let reviewers decide if this is the best approach."
