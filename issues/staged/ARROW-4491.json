Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNot sure why this is happening, but for some older compilers I'm seeing\r\n```java\n\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::invalid_argument'\r\n  what():  stoi\n```\r\nsince [https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3423](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3423.)\r\n\r\nPossible cause\u00a0is that there is no int8_t version of [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/to_string](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/to_string,)\u00a0so it might not convert it to a proper\u00a0string representation of the number.\r\n\r\nAny insight on why this could be happening is appreciated.",

On some implementations, int8_t seems to be a typedef to char and the conversion in this case produces a character and not a number."
