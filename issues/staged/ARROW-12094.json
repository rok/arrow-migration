Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8468#issuecomment-807807284. We either need to fix the build (maybe there's something not getting passed through to build_re2 correctly in cmake) or figure out the conditions under which the C++ build should turn off re2. \r\n\r\nSee also ARROW-11736 to make regex compute functions optional in R tests.",
