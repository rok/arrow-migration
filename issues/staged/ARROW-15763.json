Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nProfiling shows for string inputs, csv writer spends most of the time in counting quotes for every string, this can probably be improved by checking quotes before-ahead in batch.\r\nFor numeric inputs, the casting (number -> string) dominates the performance.",
