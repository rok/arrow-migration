Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm triyng to make Arrow as a submodule with `add_subdirectory(arrow/cpp)` command and it fails. I try to make\u00a0row-wise-conversion-example.cc but outside of project and link it with arrow_library.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nproject(test)\r\n\r\nset(ARROW_WITH_LZ4 ON CACHE INTERNAL \"\")\r\nset(ARROW_WITH_ZSTD ON CACHE INTERNAL \"\")\r\nset(ARROW_FLIGHT ON CACHE INTERNAL \"\")\r\n\r\nset(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release)\r\nadd_subdirectory(arrow/cpp)\r\n\r\nadd_executable(test row-wise-conversion-example.cc)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(test ${ARROW_LIBRARY})\r\n```\r\nFirst trouble is if there's no\u00a0CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set it fails. Then there's an error with\u00a0libprotoc build:\r\n```\n\r\nCMake Error at arrow/cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake:1427 (message):\r\n\r\n \u00a0libprotoc was set to\r\n\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n\r\n \u00a0arrow/cpp/CMakeLists.txt:496 (include)\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",
