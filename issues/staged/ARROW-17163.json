Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-17086 fixed some compiler warnings and restored the installation of jni_util.h to match prior behavior. But we never intended to expose this header, and the downstream Gluten project [no longer depends on it](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13614#issuecomment-1191198106), so we can stop installing it.",
