Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI like using the `dplyr` in conjunction with [datasets](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/dataset.html), it results in a clean code.\r\n\r\nThere are times, when I would like to use the same workflow just for a single (larger) parquet file and in most of those cases it doesn\u2019t make sense to create a separate folder for just one file. \r\n\r\n(the `read_parquet()` provides options only for selecting the columns, no filtering and grouping)\r\n\r\nIs it possible/does it make sense to extend the `open_dataset()` with an option to specify just a single file?",
