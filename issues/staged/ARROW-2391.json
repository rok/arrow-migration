        "title": "[Python] Segmentation fault from PyArrow when mapping Pandas datetime column to pyarrow.date64",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2391). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen trying to call `pyarrow.Table.from_pandas` with a `pandas.DataFrame` and a `pyarrow.Schema` provided, the function call results in a segmentation fault if Pandas `datetime64[ns]` column tries to be converted to a `pyarrow.date64` type.\r\n\r\nA minimal example which shows this is:\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'created': ['2018-05-10T10:24:01']})\r\ndf['created'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created'])}}\r\nschema = pa.schema([pa.field('created', pa.date64())])\r\npa.Table.from_pandas(df, schema=schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting the above causes the python interpreter to exit with \"Segmentation fault: 11\".\r\n\r\nAttempting to convert into various other datatypes (by specifying different schemas) either succeeds, or raises an exception if the conversion is invalid.",
