        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16121](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16121). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe custom python ParquetDataset implementation exposes the `metadata`, `metadata_path`, `common_metadata` and `common_metadata_path` attributes, something for which we didn't add an equivalent to the new dataset API. \r\n\r\nUnless we still want to add something for this, we should deprecate those attributes in the legacy ParquetDataset. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we should also deprecate passing the `metadata` keyword in the ParquetDataset constructor.
