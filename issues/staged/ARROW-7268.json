Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now, the custom metadata field in the Schema IPC message is not propagated from the IPC message to the internal data type. To be closer to parity compared to the other implementations it would be good to add the necessary logic to serialize and deserialize.",
