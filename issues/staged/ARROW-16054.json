        "title": "[Python] Use tzdata timezone database on Windows",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16054](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16054). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-13168, we enabled setting the path of the text-based database engine at runtime. This allowed R to use the tzdb package for the timezone database, since it uses the text format.\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't seem like tzdata Python package ships that text format. They do have [a \"compact\" text format](https://github.com/python/tzdata/blob/master/src/tzdata/zoneinfo/tzdata.zi), which _might_ be compatible with\u00a0our vendored date library. Otherwise, we'd likely have to wait for binary format support in https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/issues/564",

But worth trying probably."
