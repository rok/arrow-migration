The reason is that the physical layout of Arrow struct arrays is fundamentally different from the physical layout of Numpy struct arrays. Arrow struct arrays have separate child array data for each struct component, while Numpy packs struct elements contiguously. So it's not possible to get a zero-copy view of one representation into another."

It would be useful to be able to support the full gamut of fixed-size packed structs a la NumPy, and potentially also support the more complex representations being developed in the xnd/libndtypes projects right now. This is a different, though complementary effort the columnar analytics problem"
