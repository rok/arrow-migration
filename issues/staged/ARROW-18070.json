Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://dev.azure.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/_build/results?buildId=37514&view=logs&j=0da5d1d9-276d-5173-c4c4-9d4d4ed14fdb&t=d9b15392-e4ce-5e4c-0c8c-b69645229181&l=5635 for an example.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me at the moment if these are valid leaks or something we need to suppress.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible they could be prevented by running `google::protobuf::ShutdownProtobufLibrary()` at test shutdown.\r\n\r\nEither way, it would be good to validate these are not legitimate issues and prevent them in some way.",
