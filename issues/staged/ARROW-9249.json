        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9249](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9249). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe return value has the same size as the child array of a List type and contains values providing the \"cell index\" of each child value relative to the parent list array.\r\n\r\nFor example, the list array\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n[ [0, 1], null, [2], [3, 4]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould output\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n[0, 0, 2, 3, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there is no null because the child array has no nulls. If the list has null values whose offsets point to non-empty child sections then these will have to be null in the output to preserve the contract that the output array has the same length as the child array",
