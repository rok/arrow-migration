Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGiven the momentum and number of contributors involved in the Rust implementation, I think it would be useful to crowdsource a roadmap for the next few releases that we expect to release in 2021.\r\n\r\nWe have a small number of active committers on the project currently and it is hard for us to keep up with all the PRs sometimes, especially when so many different areas are being contributed to.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if we can co-ordinate to prioritize work for the release.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is open source, and anyone can contribute anything at any time, but it would be nice to have some areas that we all agree are the main priorities.\r\n\r\nI will create a PR to kick start this discussion.",
