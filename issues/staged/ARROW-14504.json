Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncc `[~coryan]`\r\nThe GCS testbench is broken on Debian 10. ARROW-14491 removes it temporarily, but it should be fixed and added back. Initially it complained about pip availability, which could be solved by installing python3-setuptools and symlinking pip to pip3 in debian-10-cpp.dockerfile, however the run itself still fails.",
