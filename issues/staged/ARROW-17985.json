        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17985](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17985). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA few odd things are going on with the Python bindings:\r\n1. Statefulness. I ran the following code:\n   \n   ```java\n   \n   import os\n   import pyarrow.fs as arrow_fs\n   def fs_():\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 s3_fs = arrow_fs.S3FileSystem(\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 access_key=\"<token>\",\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 secret_key=\"<token>\",\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 endpoint_override=\"<cloudflare r2 url>\",\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 )\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 return s3_fs\n   fs = fs_()\n   print(fs.get_file_info(\"data\"))\n   ```\n   and it worked on one machine but not the other. Only setting\n   ```java\n   \n   region=\"auto\"\n   ```\n    allowed the code to work consistently on both computers.\n   Furthermore, the error message is very opaque:\n   \n   ```java\n   \n   Traceback (most recent call last):\n     File \"cluster_scripts/test_s3.py\", line 51, in <module>\n       print(fs.get_file_info(\"data\"))\n     File \"pyarrow/_fs.pyx\", line 439, in pyarrow._fs.FileSystem.get_file_info\n     File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 143, in pyarrow.lib.pyarrow_internal_check_status\n     File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 114, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\n   OSError: When getting information for bucket 'data': AWS Error [code 100]: No response body.\n   ```\n   \n   Googling this error gives no information whatsoever. I managed to figure out the issue by switching from Cloudflare to S3, and when the issue was still going on, I explicitly set a region, but the experience was pretty painful.",

Infact the ``GetError`` is right from AWS' C++ library: [Outcome.h \\| https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/blob/b469499e96b957c478d121086272ea496c9b92e8/aws-cpp-sdk-core/include/aws/core/utils/Outcome.h#L147] Maybe just bad error code from AWS? \r\n\r\nSuggest maybe opening an issue with them, feel free to link to this issue/comment here in case I'm mistaken. :) "
