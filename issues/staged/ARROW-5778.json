Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, each vector has its own `copyFrom`\u00a0method. The implementations for fixed-width vectors are similar, whereas the implementations for the variable-width vectors are similar.\r\n\r\nThis issue extract such implementations to the base classes, with the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0Less code\u00a0makes it\u00a0easier to maintain\r\n\r\n2. Move the method to the base class makes the method more convenient to use.\u00a0",
