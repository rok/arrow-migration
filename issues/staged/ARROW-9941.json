        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9941](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9941). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen one defines an extension type in Python (by subclassing `PyExtensionType`) and uses that type e.g. in a Arrow table, the printed schema looks like this:\r\n```Java\n\r\npyarrow.Table\r\na: extension<arrow.py_extension_type>\r\nb: extension<arrow.py_extension_type>\r\n```\r\n... which isn't very informative. PyExtensionType could perhaps override ToString() and call `str` on the type instance.\r\n",
