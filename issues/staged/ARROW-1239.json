Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently used version of the git-commit-id-plugin maven plugin (2.1.9) doesn't work with recent git structures. This is for majority of the users not manifested since Arrow has the java maven root in the project subdirectory  (`/java`) instead of top level so this plugin normally doesn't kick in if maven is executed from the subdirectory (usual case - ie `cd java; mvn install` - works fine) as the plugin doesn't see the `.git` directory but it does kick in and fail if executed from the main arrow top level dir as `mvn -f java/pom.xml install` (where the `.git` sits):\n\n> $ mvn -f java/pom.xml package\n> ...\n> [ERROR] Failed to execute goal pl.project13.maven:git-commit-id-plugin:2.1.9:revision (for-jars) on project arrow-java-root: Execution for-jars of goal pl.project13.maven:git-commit-id-plugin:2.1.9:revision failed: Bare Repository has neither a working tree, nor an index -> [Help 1]\n\nSimple fix is upgrading the plugin to recent version (the minimal working version appears to be 2.1.13).\n\nThis is required for seamless integration with Jenkins (ARROW-1234).",
