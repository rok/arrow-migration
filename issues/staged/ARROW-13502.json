Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis one is tricky because the arrow function is min_max, which returns a struct(min, max). So how do we translate that back to what the user asked for if they want just min or max?",
