Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be nice if `ArrayDataVisitor` accepted a visitor struct with void-returning (instead of Status-returning) methods. Always-ok Status may not be entirely optimized away by the compiler in some situations.\r\n",
