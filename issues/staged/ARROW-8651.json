With those, it should also be possible to pickle FileFragments, and with that also Dataset.",

Certain components of the dataset API are already serializable on the C++ side, so I assume we should make that implementation complete before adding pickling for DataFragments.  cc `[~bkietz]`"

A buffer can be serialized as is? And if the Fragment is not backed by a path or buffer (eg a handle), we can simply raise an error when trying to pickle (or at least initially) ?\r\n\r\nSo for a fragment: filesytem and expressions are already serializable, I think. In addition, we need to serialize the path/buffer. \r\nFor a ParquetFragment probably the more complicating factor is also serializing the RowGroupInfo (which will need some more custom code, since right now there is not yet API exposed to create those with statistics from Python)"
