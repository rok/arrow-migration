        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17480](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17480). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOnly three FieldVector types do not implement setNull(): UnionVector, DenseUnionVector and NullVector, preventing it from being addable to the ValueVector interface and thus requiring a cast when used.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor all three vector types it could be added as a no-op. For NullVector, all values are already null. For the other two, null values are not supported at the top level, but only in the individual child vectors. \u00a0A no-op implementation is not only consistent with the existing writeNull() operations in the Union and DenseUnion Writer classes, but it is consistent with isNull(), which always returns false.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn implementation is also needed in the abstract ExtensionTypeVector, which can delegate to the underlying vector object.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee also a similar issue opened for FieldWriter (ARROW-2538), which may be closable given the current code base.\u00a0",
