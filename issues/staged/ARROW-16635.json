        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16635). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) project includes a small [utility](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-22.06/cpp/include/cudf/ipc.hpp) to read Arrow IPC messages whose location is CUDA device memory (instead of host memory), as well as [Cython bindings and wrappers](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-22.06/python/cudf/cudf/_lib/gpuarrow.pyx) for it.\r\n\r\nWe believe that it would be useful for these to live in the Arrow project itself. How would the maintainers feel about migrating it here instead?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
