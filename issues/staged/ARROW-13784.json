        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13784](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13784). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `Table.from_arrays` method returns an empty schema when supplying an empty arrays list but providing column names. As a result, the subsequent `to_pandas` method returns an empty data frame with no column names.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n`import pyarrow as pa`\r\n\r\n`arrays = []`\r\n\r\n`cols_names = [\"col1\", \"col2\"]`\r\n\r\n`table = pa.Table.from_arrays(arrays=arrays, names=cols_names)`\r\n\r\n`table.schema  # returns nothing`\r\n\r\n`df = table.to_pandas()`\r\n\r\n`df.head()`\r\n\r\n{{Empty DataFrame\r\nColumns: []\r\nIndex: [] # Expected column names to be visible here}}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume that this is because a schema cannot be built without data types?",

Instead of creating an empty table, I think we should rather raise an error in this case (that the passed arrays and column names don't match). \r\n\r\nIf you want to create an actual empty table with columns, you will need to pass a list of zero-length arrays."

But, in the special case of a list of arrays of length zero, we return just before that: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/26a34c3a2300620787806c5a8cee08ff30610e3e/python/pyarrow/table.pxi#L557-L569 \r\nSo by moving the `if len(names) != K:` check before the `if K == 0` check, this should be fixed."
