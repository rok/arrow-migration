        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7425](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7425). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have introduced writer API for `FixedSizeListVector`\u00a0via ARROW-6079, but `PromotableWriter`\u2019s support for it is incomplete.\r\n\r\nFor example, using `UnionListWriter`\u00a0we could simply write `List<List>`\u00a0type data, but for `List<FixedSizeList>`\u00a0or `FixedSizeList<FixedSizeList>`\u00a0it doesn\u2019t work.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about to enhance the `PromotableWriter`\u00a0support for `FixedSizeList`\u00a0type and add tests to verify the cases mentioned above.",
