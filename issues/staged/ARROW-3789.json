        "title": "[Python] Enable calling object in Table.to_pandas to \"self-destruct\" for improved memory use",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3789). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOne issue with using `Table.to_pandas` is that it results in a memory doubling (at least, more if there are a lot of Python objects created). It would be useful if there was an option to destroy the `arrow::Column` references once they've been transferred into the target data frame. This would render the `pyarrow.Table` object useless afterward",

            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3789?focusedCommentId=16968070) by Wes McKinney (wesm):*\nThere's a few things that have to happen:\r\n\r\n- Add \"self-destruct\" option that can result in the passed table's columns being deallocated as they are consumed. This should warn the user if for some reason the shared_ptr use_count is not 1, so that users will know that the self-destructing behavior is not taking place\n- Add \"split blocks\" option to create one block per column, to limit memory doubling to a per-column basis rather than per-data type. In the worst case, we might have a table with all columns having the same data type \u2013 the current block creation behavior would yield memory doubling even with the column \"self-destructing\" described above\n- Some split blocks can be zero-copy constructed when there are no nulls\n- Users will need to be advised to set pandas to use a no-consolidation split block policy\n  \n  I'm looking at arrow_to_pandas.cc to come up with a plan to limit code duplication between the split/non-split block construction path"
