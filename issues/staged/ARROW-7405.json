Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\u00a0Currently `isEmpty`\u00a0API is always return false in `BaseRepeatedValueVector`, and its subclass `ListVector`\u00a0did not overwrite this method.\r\n\r\nThis will lead to incorrect result, for example, a `ListVector`\u00a0with data [1,2], null, [], [5,6] should get [false, false, true, false] with this API, but now it would return [false, false, false, false].",
