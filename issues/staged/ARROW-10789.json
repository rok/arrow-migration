Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `TableProvider` trait can be used to provide custom datasources to the query plan. It can be useful for usecases like plan serialization to be able to downcast to the concrete implementation, the same way it is done for the `ExecutionPlan` trait.",
