Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, creating IO streams requires invoking various constructors with irregular names. It would be nice to expose a higher-level interface.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```python\n\r\ndef open_reader(source, compression='detect'):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Create an Arrow input stream.\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    source: str, Path, buffer, file-like object, ...\r\n        The source to open for reading\r\n    compression: str or None\r\n        The compression algorithm to use for on-the-fly decompression.\r\n        If 'detect' and source is a file path, then compression will be\r\n        chosen based on the file extension.\r\n        If None, no compression will be applied.\r\n        Otherwise, a well-known algorithm name must be supplied (e.g. \"gzip\")\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\ndef open_writer(source, compression='detect'):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Create an Arrow output stream.\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    source: str, Path, buffer, file-like object, ...\r\n        The source to open for writing\r\n    compression: str or None\r\n        The compression algorithm to use for on-the-fly compression.\r\n        If 'detect' and source is a file path, then compression will be\r\n        chosen based on the file extension.\r\n        If None, no compression will be applied.\r\n        Otherwise, a well-known algorithm name must be supplied (e.g. \"gzip\")\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

We should probably rename `pa.open_file` and `pa.open_stream` to something that is clear that they are IPC message files/streams"
