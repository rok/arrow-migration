        "title": "[Python] Allow scalars when creating expression from compute kernels",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17826](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17826). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe can create an expression (eg for a projection) using the compute kernels and passing expressions as arguments. But currently, all other arguments need to be expressions:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> pc.add(pc.field(\"a\"), pc.field(\"b\"))    # this works\r\n<pyarrow.compute.Expression add(a, b)>\r\n>>> pc.add(pc.field(\"a\"), 1)   # this fails when passing scalar (same for pa.scalar(1))\r\n...\r\nTypeError: only other expressions allowed as arguments\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can still pass a scalar expression (`pc.scalar(1)`, note `pc.` not `pa.`), but I think for scalars it would be a nice usability improvement if it's not needed to manually convert your python or pyarrow scalar to a scalar expression.
