Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should have a CUDA function that computes a hash for objects, similar to the way it is done for CPU objects at the moment. Is there a fast hash/checksum function available for CUDA, similar to xxhash? Maybe this can be implemented as a arrow::compute kernel?",
