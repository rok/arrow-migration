        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6772](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6772). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA common pattern in tests is `ASSERT_TRUE(schm->Equals(*other)`. The addition of overloaded equality operators will allow this o be written `ASSERT_EQ(*schm, *other)`, which is more idiomatic GTEST usage and will allow more informative assertion failure messages.",

Should additional comparison tests be added (in addition to AssertXXXEqual) to type_test.cc or would that be considered redundant?"
