Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`Executor` is a general purpose interface but it currently resides in `thread_pool.h` so it can't be used (for example) by `future.h` without introducing a circular dependency. It can probably just reside in `future.h`",
