Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe following wording in the format spec is a bit ambiguous:\r\n\r\n>  A struct array must still have an allocated validity bitmap, if it has one or more null values.\r\n\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#struct-layout\r\n\r\nThis can be misinterpreted as meaning that a struct array with no nulls does not have any buffer at all. In reality, it has an \"absent\" validity buffer (e.g. with 0 length).",
