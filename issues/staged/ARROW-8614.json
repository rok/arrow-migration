Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI wrote a brief blog post about DataFusion 0.17.0 [1] and Wes suggested that I post it on the Arrow blog. We might want to expand this to cover the\u00a0 Rust implementation of Arrow in general and it might be a good opportunity to talk about things we want help with for the next release (such as integration testing, implementing a parquet writer, etc).\r\n\r\n\u00a0[1] https://andygrove.io/2020/04/datafusion-0.17.0/",
