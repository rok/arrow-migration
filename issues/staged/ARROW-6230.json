I'm interested to see where the time is being spent. Reading Parquet files is quite fast in Python so I'll see what the performance is there also. \r\n\r\nThere's some work going on for the current release (see ARROW-3772, ARROW-3325, ARROW-3246) that will enable direct writing of R factors to and from Parquet, so that could be a (no pun intended) factor in the results"

I'll build the R package tomorrow and see if I can diagnose the problem"
