        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16781](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16781). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently have a RunLengthEncoded DataType class that is good enough to RLE ArrayData and ArraySpan instances, and dispatch Kernels based on it, with not too much functionally beyond that. This task is to implement the regular Arrow C++ functionality you would expect to work on all data types:\r\n \\* Corresponding Array type\r\n \\* Corresponding Array Builder\r\n \\* type traits\r\n \\* make_array() should work\r\n \\* Validate() / ValidateFull() passes\r\n \\* type tests pass\r\n \\* ...?\r\n\r\nTo me these all seem pretty entangled with each other, but if you find a way to split this into multiple tasks, feel free to do so.\r\n\r\nThe basic functionality is included in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13330>. So this PR can be based upon that branch.",
