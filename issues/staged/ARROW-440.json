Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) is a tool to get build flags.\n\nIf Arrow supports pkg-config, users can set build flags easily.\n\nFor example, [CMake supports pkg-config](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.7/module/FindPkgConfig.html).\n\nTo support pkg-config, we just install .pc file that includes build flags information.",
