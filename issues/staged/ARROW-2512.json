        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2512](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2512). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPlasma can now manage objects on the GPU, but in order to use this functionality in Python, there needs to be some way to represent these GPU objects in Python that allows computation on the GPU.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to enable this is to rely on a third party library, such as Pytorch, which will allow us to use all of its existing functionality.",

This issue is what to return if a user creates a GPU object from the python Plasma Client and wants to do computation\u00a0from Python on that object using the GPU.\u00a0"

That's what ARROW-2447 (which is nothing set in stone, just a sketch) proposes to do."
