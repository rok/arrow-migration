        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6577](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6577). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I install pyarrow on a fresh environment, the latest version (0.14.1) is picked up. But installing certain packages downgrades pyarrow to 0.13.0 or 0.12.1. I think a common dependency is causing the downgrade, my guess is boost or protobuf. This is based on several instances of this issue I encountered over the last few weeks. It took me a while to find a somewhat reproducible recipe.\r\n```java\n\r\n$ conda create -n test pyarrow pandas numpy\r\n...\r\nProceed ([y]/n)? y\r\n...\r\n$ conda install -n test ipython\r\n...\r\nProceed ([y]/n)? n\r\nCondaSystemExit: Exiting.\r\n```\r\nI have attached a mildly edited (to remove progress bars, and control characters) transcript of this session. Here `ipython` triggers the problem, and downgrades `pyarrow` to 0.12.1, but I think there are other common packages who also conflict in this way. Please let me know if I can provide more info.",

As this is a conda issue, it's probably better to ask on the conda tracker but I guess that there you will get the same answer: update conda."
