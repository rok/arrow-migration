Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n10.0.0 just released, meaning that that all install scripts that use the 'latest' tag are getting it.\r\n\r\nYet rubygems.org is still running with the 9.0.0 version a week after 10.0.0 released.\r\n\r\nThe build scripts need to start updating rubygems.org automatically, or guide users to a bundler config like \r\n```ruby\n\r\ngem \"red-arrow\", github: \"apache/arrow\", glob: \"ruby/red-arrow/*.gemspec\", require: \"arrow\", tag: 'apache-arrow-10.0.0'\r\n```\r\n",

That said... ;)\r\n\r\nEffectively we get to choose holding arrow releases on this stuff (unlikely) breaking windows deployments of arrow apps on ruby, or breaking docker deployments on ruby. I think Docker should win. I cannot imagine that many people are deploying arrow ruby apps on windows without virtualization to Linux."

So I've improved and released a new extpp gem."
