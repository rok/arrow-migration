After trying a number of things the client library will try to GCE credentials, which try to resolve `metadata.google.internal`.  So, not the most illuminating error message, but expected if (a) you are using default credentials, and (b) you have not configured your default credentials, and (c) you are not running on GCE where the fallback would work.\r\n"

But that is not the right fix. No access has been denied, not yet. Authorization has not taken place, i.e., nothing has verified whether the principal (in this case `{}will@XXX.com{`}) has permissions to access some GCS resource. In fact, not even authentication has taken place, i.e., the client library was trying to create the tokens that prove the access is coming from `will@XXX.com` and **that** failed. I think a better message could be:\r\n> Could not create a OAuth2 access token authenticate your request with Google Cloud. Your request was not sent. Such an access token is required to complete the request successfully (unless you meant to use anonymous access, but the library is not configured to do so). The underlying error was: EasyPerform() - CURL error [6]=Couldn't resolve host name."

If I run:\r\n\r\n```none\n\r\ngcloud auth application-default login\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen subsequently I can access public or private buckets just fine. I will clarify the docs to say that you must either run that command or pass `anonymous` user to access public buckets."
