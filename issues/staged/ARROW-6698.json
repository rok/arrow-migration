        "title": "[Python] Deserialize Python objects using __slots__ in pyarrow.deserialize",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6698). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi Everyone,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, well-done! This project is totally awesome.\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to serialize a Python object that uses __slots__ to minimize memory requirements I received the following error:\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 return pyarrow.deserialize(data, serialization_context)\r\n\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 461, in pyarrow.lib.deserialize\r\n\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 424, in pyarrow.lib.deserialize_from\r\n\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 275, in pyarrow.lib.SerializedPyObject.deserialize\r\n\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/serialization.pxi\", line 194, in pyarrow.lib.SerializationContext._deserialize_callback\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'RemoteExecutorObject' object has no attribute '__dict__'\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to support __slots__? If not, not a huge deal, but wanted to at least ask.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks, and thanks again for pyarrow!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n--John",
