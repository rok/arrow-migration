        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10886](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10886). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt appears that the code that implements converting iterators to arrow arrays effectively relies  on size_hint to return the precise size of the iterator otherwise it will crash (maybe) \u2013 but I think the intention of size_hint is, as the name suggests, a hint.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this ticket is to remove the assumption in the code that size_hint must return a value as well as the assumption that it is accurate. \r\n\r\nMore details can be found here\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8842#discussion_r540295695",
