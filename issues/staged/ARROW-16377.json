Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCalling [getBuffers](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/06ca00c2daeeb0d6461e7b6bec51679c19b5b92b/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/complex/ListVector.java#L652-L653)\u00a0on a ListVector adds the offsetBuffers first and the validityBuffer second. When a ListVector is populated by [loadFieldBuffers](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/06ca00c2daeeb0d6461e7b6bec51679c19b5b92b/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/complex/ListVector.java#L183-L189)\u00a0(e.g. via a VectorLoader), the validityBuffer is read first and the offsetBuffer is read second. The resulting vector represents different data than the originating vector.",
