Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nc_glib/ source archive is generated by `make dist` because includes configure script.\r\nThe current `dev/release/02-source.sh` build Arrow C++ and Arrow GLib to include the artifacts of GTK-Doc and then run `make dist`. But it is slow. \r\nSo run only `c_glib/autogen.sh` and then replace c_glib/.",
