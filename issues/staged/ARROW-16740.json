Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt one point there were two ongoing proposals for serializing exec plans.  An Arrow proposal (ir_consumer) and Substrait.  In general it is perfectly ok to have multiple representations of the exec plan.  So if someone wants the ir_consumer for whatever reason we can keep ti.  However, I believe the ir_consumer representation is no longer being actively maintained / expanded and so we should probably remove it to avoid confusion.",
