Note that the UI native link won't work for the OS itself.\r\n\r\nSince you are using Artifactory the correct yum url is: <https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/almalinux/8>\r\n\r\nCan you add notes regarding RHEL8 compatibility to <https://arrow.apache.org/release/9.0.0.html> or <https://arrow.apache.org/release/8.0.0.html> to use Almalinux instead?\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."
