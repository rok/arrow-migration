Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have `Decimal128::ToString` and `Decimal256::ToString`.  I don't know how performant they are but it should be better than nothing.  In addition, we have a lot of casting infrastructure already so this should just be an addition to that.  There shouldn't be a lot of work required here.  It will mostly be understanding how all the pieces are organized and connecting them together.",
