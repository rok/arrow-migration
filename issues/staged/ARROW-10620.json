Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGetting the range of bytes of a column chunk inside a parquet file can be useful for external crates (for instance if they want to pre-fetch the columns), and is not completely obvious (it is enough to take a look at [1] and [2] to see that things can quickly get messy). \r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to move this logic in the metadata definition rather than have lost it in the middle of the reader implem. \r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55225108/why-is-dictionary-page-offset-0-for-plain-dictionary-encoding/\r\n[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-816",
