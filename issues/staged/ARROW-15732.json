        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15732](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15732). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, scan operations that supply use_threads=false will use 1 CPU thread, the calling thread, and some # of I/O threads.  We should remove that CPU thread from being used.\r\n\r\nIt is being used at the moment because we need something to transfer work onto when asynchronous I/O tasks complete.  We can fix this by allowing a serial executor to run an async generator (creating an iterator).  This will also allow us to change the execution plan so that it always expects an executor to be present which should simplify the logic.",
