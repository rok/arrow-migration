Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was intuitively thinking that the following code would work:\r\n\r\n`Status s;`\r\n`Int64Builder builder;`\r\n`s = builder.Append(1);`\r\n`s = builder.Append(2);`\r\n\r\n`std::shared_ptr<NumericArray<Int64Type>> array;`\r\n`builder.Finish(&array);`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not seem to work, as the finish operation is not overloaded in the Int64 (or the numeric builder).\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to add this interface?",
