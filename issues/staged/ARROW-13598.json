Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt looks like \"collection\" datums are not used anywhere. Where we want to return several pieces of data, we generally return a Struct array or scalar wrapping them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should simply deprecate or even remove them.\r\n",

We can always restore it if it does turn out to be useful. It seems to me, though, that instead of having a Datum contain more Datums, we'd rather instead have a stream of Datums (as indeed the query engine effectively does)."
