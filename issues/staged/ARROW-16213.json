Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen defining UDFs the ability to use a function on both scalar and array with a single function definition is important. Here using a function just written for array-like inputs on scalars is a vital component when providing better support. Further more, UDFs need to be consistent with the pre-registered functions in the function registry. Considering both usability and consistency, it is important to support this feature.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis requirement was a part of discussion in Scalar UDF integration PR[1].\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[1]. https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12590#issuecomment-1089426784",
