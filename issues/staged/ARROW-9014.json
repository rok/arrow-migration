        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9014](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9014). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCrossbow uses setuptools_scm to generate a development version number using git describe command. This means that it finds the latest `reachable` tag from the current commit on master. \r\n\r\nThe minor releases are created from the master branch whereas the patch release tags point to commits on maintenance branches (like 0.17.x) which means that if we already have released a patch version, like 0.17.1 then crossbow generates a version number like 0.17.0.dev{number-of-commits-from-0.17.0} and bumps its patch tag, eventually creating binary packages with version 0.17.1.dev123.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with this is that the produced nightly python wheels are not picked up by pip, because on pypi we already have that patch release available and pip doesn't consider 0.17.1.dev123 newer than 0.17.1 (with --pre option passed). \r\n\r\nSo to force pip to install the newer nightly packages we need to bump the minor version instead.
