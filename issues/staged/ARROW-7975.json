Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt this line, we include the padding bytes into the IPC metadata\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-0.16.0/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/writer.cc#L192\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is that buffer sizes are modified by an IPC roundtrip. According to the Format, the padding bytes do not need to be accounted for in the metadata. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Schema.fbs#L330\r\n\r\nThe Java implementation, for example, does not.\r\n\r\nI ran into this when working on a prototype implementation of ARROW-300, where it is important to have the exact unpadded size of the original buffer that was written.
