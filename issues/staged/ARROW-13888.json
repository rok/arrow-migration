Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the docs for `schema()`, the ellipses argument is documented as \"named list of data types\".\r\n\r\nHowever, if I create a schema using a named list, e.g.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nshare_schema <- schema(\r\n  list(\r\n    company = utf8(),\r\n    price = float64(),\r\n    date = date32()\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n```\r\nI get the error: \\`Error: !is.null(nms <- names(.list)) is not TRUE `\r\n\r\nWe should:\r\n1. Rephrase the documentation of that argument so it doesn't say to use a named list\n1. Update the error message shown if a named list is supplied to be a little clearer about what the user has done wrong\n   \n   \u00a0",
