Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have LLVM 7.1 installed locally, and FindClangTools couldn't locate it because ARROW_LLVM_VERSION is [hardcoded to 7.0](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3f2a33f902983c0d395e0480e8a8df40ed5da29c/cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L91-L99) and clang tools is [restricted to the minor version](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3f2a33f902983c0d395e0480e8a8df40ed5da29c/cpp/cmake_modules/FindClangTools.cmake#L78).\r\n\r\nIf it makes sense to restrict clang tools location down to the minor version, then we need to pass the located LLVM's version instead of the hardcoded one.",
