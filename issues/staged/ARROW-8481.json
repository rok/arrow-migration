Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is in response to the discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6323#issuecomment-614195070\r\n\r\nIn this issue, we provide an allocation manager that is capable of allocation large (> 2GB) buffers. In addition, it does not depend on the netty library, which is aligning with the general trend of removing netty dependencies. In the future, we are going to make it the default allocation manager.
