Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis issue is opened in response to a discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5861#discussion_r348917065.\r\n\r\nWe found the current style checking for Java code is not sufficient. So we want to enhace it in a series of \"small\" steps, in order to avoid having to change too many files at once. \r\n\r\nIn this issue, we remove consecutive spaces between tokens, so that tokens are separated by single spaces.
