        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13741](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13741). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI believe the current interpretation of `ExecContext::executor == null` is that the exec plan should run serially.  However, I do not believe this will hold up once any form of scheduling begins.\r\n\r\nFor a simple example, consider back pressure.  What should an exec plan do if it is not ready to consume data.  My assumption is that somehow a future task will be created to resume once the back pressure has been relieved.  If there is no executor to receive a future task then I don't see how this happens.\r\n\r\nOr, to look at it another way, if an exec plan is going to start using a scheduler of some kind, then it makes sense for that scheduler to always be there.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that you must run in parallel.  We have an executor which handles serial execution (\"SerialExecutor\" obtained by \"RunInSerialExecutor\").  This essentially converts the calling thread into an event-loop style thread pool of size one and then uses that as the executor.",
