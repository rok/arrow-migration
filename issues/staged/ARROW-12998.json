Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBecause of ARROW-12644 now partition.cc includes utf.8 which in turn includes xsimd. There's no dependency exposed to CMake so if Ninja et. al. schedule the build 'badly', it'll build partition.cc before building xsimd, causing a missing header error.\r\n\r\nExample: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10470/checks?check_run_id=2767312685>",
