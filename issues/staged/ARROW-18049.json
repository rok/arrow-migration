Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should support the ability to rename columns when reading in data via the CSV/Parquet/Feather/JSON file readers.\r\n\r\nWe currently have an argument `col_select`, which allows users to choose which columns to read in, but renaming doesn't work.  \r\n\r\nTo implement this, we'd need to check if any columns have been renamed by `col_select` and then updating the schema of the object being returned once the file has been read.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nreadr::read_csv(readr_example(\"mtcars.csv\"), col_select = c(not_hp = hp))\r\n#> # A tibble: 32 \u00d7 1\r\n#>    not_hp\r\n#>     <dbl>\r\n#>  1    110\r\n#>  2    110\r\n#>  3     93\r\n#>  4    110\r\n#>  5    175\r\n#>  6    105\r\n#>  7    245\r\n#>  8     62\r\n#>  9     95\r\n#> 10    123\r\n#> # \u2026 with 22 more rows\r\narrow::read_csv_arrow(readr_example(\"mtcars.csv\"), col_select = c(not_hp = hp))\r\n#> # A tibble: 32 \u00d7 1\r\n#>       hp\r\n#>    <int>\r\n#>  1   110\r\n#>  2   110\r\n#>  3    93\r\n#>  4   110\r\n#>  5   175\r\n#>  6   105\r\n#>  7   245\r\n#>  8    62\r\n#>  9    95\r\n#> 10   123\r\n#> # \u2026 with 22 more rows\r\n```\r\n",
