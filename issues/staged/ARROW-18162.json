Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`xsimd` 9.0+ supports Arm SVE (fixed size). Some additional compiler options are required to enable SVE.\r\n\r\nPer my test on Amazon Graviton3 (SVE-256). SVE256 performs much better than NEON for some cases. E.g., utf8 benchmark `ValidateLargeAscii` improves from **38.6** (NEON) to **51.5** (SVE256) GB/s.",
