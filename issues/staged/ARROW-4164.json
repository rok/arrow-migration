Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen dealing with arrays at runtime it is possible to represent them with ArrayRef, allowing for things like Vec<ArrayRef> and then downcasting arrays as needed based on schema meta data.\r\n\r\nI am now trying to do the same thing with ArrayBuilder but because this trait has an associated type, I cannot create a Vec<ArrayBuilder>. This makes it difficult in some cases to dynamic build arrays.",
