I think that changing `struct ConversionTraits<c_type> {` to `struct ConversionTraits<c_type> : public TypeTraits<ArrowType_> {` would provide most of it.\r\n\r\nAlso as someone still newish to the codebase, my first instinct was to look into `type_traits.h` and not `stl.h`, but that might just be due to the lack of documentation."

Currently it is not at that more central place as the stl functionality has not yet been a first class citizen in the projects. Most of Arrow's structures are built for runtime types, not compile-time types. We still need to support for those that already know their column types during compilation."
