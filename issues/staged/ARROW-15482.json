We can't use it for different version.\r\n\r\nWe can unset `ARROW_XXX_BUILD_SHA256_CHECKSUM` when `ARROW_XXX_SOURCE_URL` environment variable is used to skip checksum verification. Or we can accept `ARROW_XXX_BUILD_SHA256_CHECKSUM` environment variable too.\r\n\r\nImproving C+ dependency manager integration is a good idea but we can't replace the thirdparty toolchain with it. Because we can't support offline build with C++ dependency manager."
