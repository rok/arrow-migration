Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt appears that \r\n\r\n          python -m pip download --dest /tmp pyarrow==0.17.1 --no-binary :all:\r\n\r\ntakes several minutes to execute. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be an increase in runtime starting from 0.16.0: on Python 2 \r\n\r\n     python -m pip download --dest /tmp pyarrow==0.15.1 --no-binary :all:\r\n\r\nappears to be somewhat faster, but the same command is still slow on Py3.\r\n\r\nThe command is stuck for a while with \"Installing build dependencies ... \", and increased CPU usage.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this command is to download source tarball for a package and its dependencies.\r\n\r\nSome investigation was started on the mailing list: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r9baa48a9d1517834c285f0f238f29fcf54405cb7cf1e681314239d7f%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E",

And this is what takes some more time."
