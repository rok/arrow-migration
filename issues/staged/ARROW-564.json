        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-564). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, for `pyarrow.Array` instances, we have a method called `to_pandas`. While this method returns NumPy Arrays, it returns them in the form that Pandas would use them in its `Series`. The difference here is visible for example in the case of integers with null values. For Pandas, we convert it into a float array and set all entries to NaN where we have null entries in the Arrow array. For vanilla NumPy arrays, we would return a tuple of a valid bytemap (not bitmap!) and a values array. The values array in this case should simply be a view on the underlying Arrow buffer.",
