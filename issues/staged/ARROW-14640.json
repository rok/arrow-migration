Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am trying to read data directly from S3. In my work pipeline I work under proxy, so I set system environments HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY. Also I have set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. \u00a0I have constructed links for reading:\r\n```java\n\r\ns3_uri <- paste0(\"s3://\", accessKeyId, \":\", URLencode(secretAccessKey, reserved = T),\"@\", bucketName, \"/\", path) \r\ns3_uri_short <- paste0(\"s3://\", bucketName, \"/\", path)\r\nbucketS3 <- arrow::s3_bucket(bucket = bucketName, access_key = accessKeyId,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0secret_key = URLencode(secretAccessKey, reserved = T))\n```\r\nBut none of them worked for arrow::read_parquet\r\n```java\n\r\ndf <- arrow::read_parquet(s3_uri)\r\ndf <- arrow::read_parquet(s3_uri_short) \r\ndf <- arrow::read_parquet(bucketS3$path(x = path))\n```\r\nError\r\n```java\n\r\n\u00a0IOError: When reading information for key AWS Error [code 15]: No response body. with address : \n```\r\nHow can I fix the problem or maybe get more informative output ? Thanks for attention.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI knew about same issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12126\u00a0but I can't reopen it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Relevant C++ defs are the [S3ProxyOptions](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.h#L44-L57) and [S3Options](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.h#L122). Working on this now!"
