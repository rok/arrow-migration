Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs duscussed [in this Dask issue](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7756#discussion_r682908950), it would be useful if the `ORCWriter`/`write_table` API allowed the user to specify a specific stripe size.\u00a0 I would expect the argument/usage to be similar to `row_group_size` in `pyarrow.parquet.write_table`.",
