Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Rust build is the longest-running build in Appveyor now by 7-10 minutes, perhaps inflated more now because of the Parquet donation\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/21118767\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to split this into two builds, or otherwise improve the runtime?",
