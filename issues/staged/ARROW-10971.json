        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10971](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10971). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the left join generates a null for every row that is not present in the right batch.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is wrong, as there should be no match in _all_ of the right batches.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation generates extra (left, none) tuples for every batch when there is no match against a left key.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, we need to mark the keys or indexes on the left side as visited and scan the items once at the end to generate the rows without any match.\u00a0",
