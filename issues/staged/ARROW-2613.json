Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `dev/gen_apidocs.sh` docker-based script is a bit out-of-date compared to the build process we currently have.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, at the moment it always does a new clean build of the C++, GLib and Cython binaries and this docs generation takes quite long.",
