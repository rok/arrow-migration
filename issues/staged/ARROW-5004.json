        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5004](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5004). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3129732a18210d0c8921b45f79be4f34eadf0cc3/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L686>\r\n\r\nHere the type of a partition key\u00a0is converted to match the type of a filter variable.\r\n\r\nusing the **write_to_dataset**\u00a0function allows **boolean** partition keys (**True** or **False)** but these\u00a0silently break at the linked line as **bool('False')** evaluates as **True**.\r\n\r\nI understand\u00a0a docstring (<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3129732a18210d0c8921b45f79be4f34eadf0cc3/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L653)>\u00a0refers to only string or int partition variables being supported although this is somewhat buried away from the user facing API.\r\n\r\nIt may be beneficial to detect the boolean case and raise a warning or to ensure the function returns a more intuitive output when partition key is **'False'** and the filter variable is **False.**",
