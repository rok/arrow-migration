Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI forgot to add ci/PKGBUILD to the release script that bumps all of the versions, so the pkgver it has is out of sync with what is in r/DESCRIPTION after the release.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo fix, either update the\u00a0pkgver\u00a0in ci/PKGBUILD and add code to the release script and tests to bump its version, or remove the pkgver field entirely and just read it from\u00a0r/DESCRIPTION in the pkgver() function, if makepkg allows that. Unclear if one\u00a0solution is clearly better than the other.",
