Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is inflating CI runtime. This is a bit of work as we do not currently have granular control over which unit tests get built. We may have to add some logic to tag tests with extra metadata that can be used for conditional compilation (beyond the all-or-nothing `NO_TESTS` CMake variable being used now)",
