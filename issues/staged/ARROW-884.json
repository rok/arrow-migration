Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur API docs are a bit smelly with quite a few internal classes and methods:\n\nhttp://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/annotated.html\n\nWe should add internal constructs to an `arrow::internal` namespace so that we can use the EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS rule in Doxygen to exclude them from the documentation.
