Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI found that I had to add `-Wdocumentation` to `ARROW_CXXFLAGS` to replicate docstring-related failures in CI. I'm not sure why this is being set in Travis CI but not locally (with BUILD_WARNING_LEVEL=CHECKIN), but we should make it consistent and also document that it is a requirement in the C++ development Sphinx documentation",
