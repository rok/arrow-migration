Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am currently using v0.15.0 of the arrow package, installed from source using CRAN. I also have v1.0.4 of the sparklyr package installed. While attempting to read in Parquet data with both packages attached, the read_parquet function appears to ignore the as_data_frame argument (which defaults to TRUE).\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3d55122c56a508894823a1b79bca71f519fdd52f/r/R/parquet.R#L35-L47>\r\n\r\nI am not certain, but I suspect the issue may be in the way\u00a0Table__to_dataframe coerces Arrow Table objects into tibbles, since this statement appears also to produce a tibble (I expected a data.frame to be returned):\r\n\r\n`arrow:::Table__to_dataframe(tab, use_threads=FALSE)`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA reproducible example follows.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`# This does work as expected, returns data.frame`\r\n\r\n`library(arrow)`\r\n\r\n`temp <- tempfile()`\r\n `download.file(\"https://github.com/Teradata/kylo/blob/master/samples/sample-data/parquet/userdata1.parquet?raw=true\", temp)`\r\n\r\n`read_parquet(temp, as_data_frame=TRUE)`\r\n\r\n`# This does not work as expected, returns tibble`\r\n\r\n`library(sparklyr)`\r\n\r\n`read_parquet(temp, as_data_frame=TRUE)``\u00a0`",

These additional attributes are added to the data.frame that `arrow` returns, but you only notice them when you're using the tibble package.\u00a0When you load `sparklyr`, the tibble namespace is loaded, so the tibble print method is found and used.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is noted in the new package vignette:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/vignettes/arrow.Rmd#L15>\r\n\r\n`as_data_frame` governs whether you get an R data.frame/tibble or whether the data is kept in Arrow memory as an arrow::Table\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/R/parquet.R#L27-L28>"
