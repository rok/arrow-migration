        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10240](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10240). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe tpch benchmark runtime seems to be dominated by csv parsing code and it is really difficult to see any performance hotspots related to actual query execution in a flamegraph.\r\n\r\nWith the date in memory and more iterations it should be easier to profile and find bottlenecks.",
