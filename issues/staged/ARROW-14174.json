Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-14027 incidentally adds helpers to manipulate decimal scalars as just bytes - we should take advantage of this to consolidate kernel implementations for functions like case_when, if_else, and coalesce that had different implementations since decimal scalars previously had a different layout.",
