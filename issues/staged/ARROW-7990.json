Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed when running `archery lint --iwyu` that it failed silently for me (Ubuntu 18.04 / clang 7)\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n-- Configuring done\r\n-- Generating done\r\n-- Build files have been written to: /tmp/arrow-lint-bbwghazv/cpp-build\r\n[1/1] cd /tmp/arrow-lint-bbwghazv/cpp-bu...ode/arrow/cpp/build-support/iwyu/iwyu.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the root cause of the silent failure is ARROW-7989, but in any case such a failure should make itself visible",
