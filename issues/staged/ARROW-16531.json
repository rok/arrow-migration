The issue is, our pre-commit configuration is using an old version of flake8 that is checking cython. I suppose `[~westonpace]` has an old version (pre flake8==4.0.1) on its virtualenv which is still checking these files. Newer versions of flake8 won't support it (based on the flake8 repo conversation I linked).\r\n\r\nI think we have a couple of possibilites:\r\n \\* pin an old version of flake8 so we continue with the old checks.\r\n \\* Update the pre-commit version to use the latest flake8 and pin the archery dependency to use the latest flake8 and find a different way of linting the cython files (at least line length)"

According to [this message](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/1482#issuecomment-985891574), people linting Cython with flake8 were \"abusers\"."
