Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen C++ specific flags are passed to the C flags, we get problems when C++ specific flags like `-std=c++14` are passed. Instead of manually stripping these flags explicitly, we should better separate `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`\u00a0from `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/conda-forge/arrow-cpp-feedstock/pull/64",
