Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have min_max but that returns a struct array. At some point we will want compute kernels that we can call in a ProjectNode that will allow us to get at struct array elements, but for now it would be nice to have (hash_)min and max that just give the scalar we want.",
