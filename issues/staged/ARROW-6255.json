        "title": "[Rust] [Parquet] Cannot use any published parquet crate due to parquet-format breaking change",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6255). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a user who wants to use the Rust version of Arrow, I am unable to use any of the previously published versions due to the recent breaking change in parquet-format 2.6.0.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, simply create an empty Rust project using \"cargo init example --bin\", add a dependency on any version of parquet e.g. \"parquet-0.14.1\" and attempt to build the project.\r\n```java\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Compiling parquet v0.13.0\r\n\r\nerror[E0599]: no variant or associated item named `BOOLEAN` found for type `parquet_format::parquet_format::Type` in the current scope\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 --> /Users/agrove/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/parquet-0.13.0/src/basic.rs:408:28\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 |\r\n\r\n408 | \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 parquet::Type::BOOLEAN => Type::BOOLEAN,\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ^^^^^^^ variant or associated item not found in `parquet_format::parquet_format::Type`\n```\r\nThis bug has already been fixed in master [1], but there is no usable published crate. We could consider publishing a 0.14.2 to resolve this or just wait until the 0.15.0 release. We could also consider using this Jira to at least document a workaround, if one exists (maybe Cargo provides a mechanism for overriding transitive dependencies?).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[1]\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6047",

For instance, to ensure that the version is less than 2.6.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\nparquet-format = \"< 2.6.0\"\n```\r\nThe various dependency-specification syntaxes can be found here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html\r\n\r\n[~nevi_me] It appears that `parquet-format` 2.6.0 doesn't follow SemVer, since it is a (possibly inadvertently) breaking change. To correctly follow SemVer, it should be relabeled 3.x.x."
