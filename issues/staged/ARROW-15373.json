        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15373). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMemoryManager::AllocateBuffer currently returns shared_ptr<Buffer>, but analogously to arrow::AllocateBuffer, it should probably return unique_ptr<Buffer>. Also, we can convert a unique_ptr to a shared_ptr but not the other way around.\r\n\r\nThis would be a breaking change in a core API, though. I _think_ this API is not used much, given it is relatively new, but we should keep this in mind.\r\n\r\n(Context: for the Flight/UCX prototype, I'm trying to integrate MemoryManager support given UCX can transparently handle some types of non-CPU memory, but while I've used mostly unique_ptr so far, MemoryManager uses shared_ptr which did cause a small snag.)",
