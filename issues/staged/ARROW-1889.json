Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe workaround implemented yesterday for the version determination uses Git's `--exclude` option which is only available on very recent versions of Git. Instead we should use a `--match` expression that only matches the non-JS tags.",
