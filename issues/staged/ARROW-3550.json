Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the default value in the NumericArray constructor for the null_count is 0.\r\n\r\nI wonder wether it would be better to use\u00a0kUnknownNullCount instead? A user could still choose to supply a null_count of 0, or a nullptr as bitmask which would imply a null_count of 0 as well.",
