I agree that this would be a useful feature to have.  I've linked this to a previous request to implement this in the C++ library (ARROW-11587), which would be necessary to implement this in the R package."

I developed an R+`arrow` solution for extracting all variables by having an R loop with calls to arrow to extract on variable per iteration, see my answer [here\\|[http://example.com|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74280697/dplyr-way-to-break-variable-into-multiple-columns-acording-to-layout-dictionar/74281380?noredirect=1#comment131145927_74281380]]. The only piece missing is some way to just read the fwf and place the data in column 1 of a table. In R: `d <- data.frame(s=readLines('myfwf.txt'))`. Is there an arrow equivalent to that?"
