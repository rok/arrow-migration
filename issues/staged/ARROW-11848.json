        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11848](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11848). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have found this iterator useful for some special purpose kernels I've created. For instance, I created something for concatenating multiple arrays together and \"spreading them out\", such that \"filter(spread(input, bits), bits) == input\".\r\n\r\nWhile some of these special kernels could be added to Arrow, it seems like exposing the building-blocks could be useful too. Thoughts?",
