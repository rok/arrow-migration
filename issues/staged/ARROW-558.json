If an attacker were to compromise it they compromise the integrity of all releases. And it's pointless including it in the release tarball. \n\nIt has to be in svn, because it has to be on the site, but there should be no other copies. "

Sadly https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html#keys-policy doesn't provide a statement about whether to put it in git or not, so the only source for it was \"how do others do it?\". "

If  you look at some of the more security-oriented projects ([knox](https://github.com/apache/knox), [hadoop](https://github.com/apache/hadoop), [ranger](https://github.com/apache/ranger), [sentry](https://github.com/apache/sentry), [httpd](https://github.com/apache/httpd)) none of them have a KEYS file checked in. (Calcite does, and yes, we should fix it.)"
