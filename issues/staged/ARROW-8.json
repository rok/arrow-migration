Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI will ask INFRA to enable Travis CI for the repo, and then will propose a patch that runs the C++ test suite to start (unless some kind soul beats me to it with a Java patch). We can use a build matrix with one build per language SDK (so gcc and clang for arrow-cpp) to start. ",
