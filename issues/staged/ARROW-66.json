Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI followed [the guide](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/doc/INSTALL.md) to install Arrow project from scratch. I met some issues.\n\n1. First of all, I need to build the cpp part. So I setup the thirdparty dependencies. But when I `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ARROW_HOME ..`, it shows an error at `get_filename_component` with `FindGTest.cmake`. After some digging, I noticed that I have to use **cmake 3** (instead of cmake 2).\n\n2. Now I am able to install `pyarrow`. The installation went smooth. But when I import the module `pyarrow`, it says `ImportError: No module named array`. I haven't found any description on this error. ",

I installed pyarrow after libarrow.so is generated. I set `ARROW_HOME=/usr/local` not `$HOME/local`. \n\nNow I have tried another two approaches:\n1. Exactly follow the instruction with `ARROW_HOME=$HOME/local`. \n2. Install Anaconda2 into my current user home and then try approach 1.\nBoth approaches have the same error message.\n\nI believe the error comes from\n```Java\nfrom pyarrow.includes.libarrow cimport *\n```\nI'm not familiar with cython, is there anything I have missed?"

You will have to look at the compiler flags to see what path is being used for the rpath (feel free to post them here). To facilitate further debugging please post complete console logs, please use `make VERBOSE=1` when building libarrow. To avoid cmake caching problems, please run `git clean -fdx` on the entire git clone. \n\nNote that the test suite currently fails on Python 2.7 (ARROW-55). "
