Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the case of all elements of an array being null, no buffers whatsoever **need** to be allocated (similar to NullArray). This is a more extreme case of the optimization which allows the null bitmap buffer to be null if all elements are valid. Currently `arrow::Array` requires at least a null bitmap buffer to be allocated (and all bits set to 0).",
