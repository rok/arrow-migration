Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI find some trivial (and obviously irrelevant) changes to UTF8 validation code may cause big variances to benchmark result.\r\nUTF8 validation functions are inlined and called directly in benchmark. The compiler may try to optimize them together with the benchmark loop.\r\nUn-inline the benchmark-ed functions makes the result predictable and explainable.",
