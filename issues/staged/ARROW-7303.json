Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen building benchmarks, I get the following error:\r\n```Java\n\r\n../src/arrow/csv/converter_benchmark.cc:83:64: error: too many arguments to function call, expected 2, have 3\r\n    ABORT_NOT_OK(converter->Convert(parser, 0 /* col_index */, &result));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was introduced by ARROW-7236. I guess the CI didn't catch it because we don't currently build benchmarks? `[~apitrou]` `[~kszucs]`",
