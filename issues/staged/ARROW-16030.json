Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nwe have `implicit_schema()` which can generate the final schema for a query, though it's not exported. Maybe we \"just\" export that for people to be able to get what the schema of the resulting query will be.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could make a `schema` (S3) method that would return the (implicit) schema with `schema(query_obj)`. Though this might be overloading `schema` since that is not how we retrieve schemas elsewhere (e.g. `schema(arrow_table(mtcars))` does not currently work).\r\n\r\nOne use case: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/3299",

It relates to ARROW-15168 in that it would be another S3 generic that produces an arrow object.\r\n\r\nI think there are three things going on with a schema...construction (`schema(...)`, coercion (`as_arrow_schema(...)` maybe), and extraction (???). Lots of libraries lump bits of that together...(e.g., `sf::st_crs(...)` does both all three!). Substrait will need extraction, too, so it should definitely exist. Maybe `extract_schema(x)`? Should it also infer the schema from a data.frame or database connection (like `type(x)`?)."
