A slice of a RecordBatch with a string column and offset =0 returns the whole batch instead.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({ 'b': ['test' for x in range(1000_000)]})\r\ntbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\nbatch = tbl.to_batches()[0]\r\n\r\nbatch.slice(0,2).serialize().size\r\n#\u00a04000232\r\n\r\nbatch.slice(1,2).serialize().size\r\n#\u00a0240\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",
