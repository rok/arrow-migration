        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13580](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13580). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMy interpretation of the \"string\" in quoted_strings_can_be_null is that it is referring to the unparsed CSV input string and not the actual output data type.\r\n\r\nSo when converting:\r\n\r\n```csv\n\r\n\"one\",\"two\",\"three\"\r\n\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"\r\n\"4\",\"\",\"6\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should get...\r\n[1, 4], [2, None], [3, 6]\r\n\r\n...currently we get...\r\n[1, 4], ['2', None], [3, 6]\r\n\r\nIn pandas the above string parses to...\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> f = io.BytesIO(b'\"one\",\"two\",\"three\"\\n\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"\\n\"4\",\"\",\"6\"')\r\n>>> pandas.read_csv(f)\r\n   one  two  three\r\n0    1  2.0      3\r\n1    4  NaN      6\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this is bringing us closer to pandas which is probably a good thing.\r\n\r\nInspired by: https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/10892 ",
