Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, `$columns` method returns columns as a list without names. It would be nice if they were named instead, similar to `as.list` on a `data.frame`.\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\n> library(arrow)\r\n> names(record_batch(x = 1, y = 'a')$columns)\r\nNULL\r\n> names(arrow_table(x = 1, y = 'a')$columns)\r\nNULL\r\n> as.list(data.frame(x = 1, y = 'a'))\r\n$x\r\n[1] 1\r\n\r\n$y\r\n[1] \"a\"\r\n```",
