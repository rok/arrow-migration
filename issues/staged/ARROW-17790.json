        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17790](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17790). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nStarting from LLVM 13, LLVM IR has been shifting towards a unified opaque pointer type, i.e. pointers without pointee types. It has provided workarounds until LLVM 15. The temporary workarounds need to be replaced in order to support LLVM 15 and onwards. We need to supply the pointee type to the CreateGEP and CreateLoad methods.\r\n\r\nFor more background info, see <https://llvm.org/docs/OpaquePointers.html> and <https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-February/081822.html>\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14363\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17728\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17775\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
