        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13618](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13618). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13344 enabled the dplyr verb\u00a0`summarise()`\u00a0to use the Arrow engine but kept this off by default, controlled by the `arrow.debug` option.\r\n\r\nBefore this can be turned on by default, we should ensure that the following are all implemented:\r\n \\* a sufficient set of hash aggregate kernels and R aggregate function mappings to them, covering the vast majority of all aggregate functions that dplyr users call in `summarise()`\u00a0(add any additional required ones to ARROW-13339)\r\n \\* support for a sufficient set of data types in aggregates\r\n \\* support for a sufficient set of data types in grouping columns\r\n \\* handling of\u00a0`NA` and `NaN`\u00a0values in aggregates and the `na.rm` option consistent with base R and dplyr (ARROW-13497 and possibly other issues)\r\n \\* handling of `NA` and `NaN` values in grouping columns consistent with dplyr\r\n \\* handling empty or bad input to `summarise()`\u00a0(ARROW-13543)\r\n \\* many new tests to confirm equivalent results from a variety of\u00a0`group_by() %>% summarise()`\u00a0queries\u00a0on data frames and on Arrow data\r\n \\* resolution of various related bugs",
