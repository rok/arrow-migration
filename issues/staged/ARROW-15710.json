I was able to reproduce a deadlock on MacOS.  The failure occurred in TestThreadPoolForkSafety.NestedChild in the call to waitpid.  That was as far as I got debugging.  I'll look into this more tomorrow now that I can reproduce."

On the man page for `fork` we see:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nAfter a fork() in a multithreaded program, the child can\r\n          safely call only async-signal-safe functions (see\r\n          signal-safety(7)) until such time as it calls execve(2).\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems we get away with this on Linux.  Also, it seems that tests like MultipleChildThreads works fine even though it also seems unsafe.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason it seems that a grandchild fork is simply not really supported on osx.  The grandchild process never finishes.  Instead it gets stuck in bizarre and nonsensical deadlocks (backtrace of one such deadlock attached.  There are only two threads and they are blocked on unrelated mutexes). [stacktrace.txt](stacktrace.txt) "
