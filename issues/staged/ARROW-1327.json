Apparently this came up because `mod_wsgi` uses sub-interpreters, workaround is add `WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}` to the config to prevent this.\nhttp://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/configuration-directives/WSGIApplicationGroup.html\n\nSome additional reference - sounds like a pain to fully support in the general case, so an acceptable answer may be to not and document as such.\nhttps://emptysqua.re/blog/python-c-extensions-and-mod-wsgi/\n\n"
