Such a comparison should not raise an error, but I think return False instead (or at least give a more informative error message)\r\n\r\ncc `[~amol-]`  a similar case as ARROW-12466 (but not segfaulting), but when comparing with a scalar and not array in this case."

It seems that for all Array subclasses comparing to `None` is correctly handled and for `ChunkedArray` too is correctly handled. So the problem seem to be limited to scalars in term of comparing arrays and their content."
