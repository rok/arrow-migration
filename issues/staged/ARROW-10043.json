        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10043](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10043). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am unsure where support for `DISTINCT` may be on the DataFusion roadmap, so I've filed this with the \"Wish\" type and \"Minor\" priority to reflect that this is a proposal:\r\n\r\nIntroduce `DISTINCT` into DataFusion by partially implementing `COUNT(DISTINCT)`. The ultimate goal is to fully support the `DISTINCT` keyword, but to get implementation started, limit the scope of this work to:\r\n \\* the `COUNT()` aggregate function\r\n \\* a single expression in `COUNT()`, i.e., `COUNT(DISTINCT c1)`, but not `COUNT(DISTINCT c1, c2)`\r\n \\* only queries with a `GROUP BY` clause\r\n \\* integer types",
