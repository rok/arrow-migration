Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should create a C# plasma client, so .NET code can get and put objects into the plasma store.\r\n\r\nAn easy-ish way of implementing this would be to build on the c_glib C APIs already exposed for the plasma client. Unfortunately, I haven't found a decent C# GObject generator, so I think the C bindings will need to be written by hand, but there isn't too many of them.",

Is there a specific reason? That won't block creating a C# client though, since .NET Core can run on Mac and Linux.\r\n\r\nAlso, can someone tell me what scenarios Plasma enables? This will help prioritize this work. If there are interesting/important scenarios that get enabled, it will increase the priority."

I think that we can't do it on Windows.\n  \n  Anyway, how about starting discussion on the dev@ mailing list?"
