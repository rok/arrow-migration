Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[**RegexSubstringMatcher** is available only when RE2 is enabled as it is guarded with #ifdef ARROW_WITH_RE2](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_string.cc#L861-L862) but it is [used in MatchLike kernel without the RE2 guard](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_string.cc#L1113), so it compilation fails.",
