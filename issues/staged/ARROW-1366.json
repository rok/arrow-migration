Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncc `[~robertnishihara]` `[~pcmoritz]`\n\nI've just posted the binary wheels for pyarrow 0.6.0 to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyarrow\n\nI haven't tested out `plasma_store` in the wheels, but it may be difficult for users to start because it's nested inside site-packages/pyarrow. \n\nWe should provide guidance in this case; perhaps we can add a function which can return the absolute path to the Plasma store which people can use to set an environment variable like `$PLASMA_STORE`",
