Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nClosely related to ARROW-13117 is the problem of `type()` and `type_id()` not working for scalar expressions. For example, currently this happens:\r\n\r\n```r\n> Expression$scalar(\"foo\")$type()\r\nError: !is.null(schema) is not TRUE\r\n\r\n> Expression$scalar(42L)$type()\r\nError: !is.null(schema) is not TRUE\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what we want to happen:\r\n```r\n> Expression$scalar(\"foo\")$type()\r\nUtf8\r\nstring\r\n\r\n> Expression$scalar(42L)$type()\r\nInt32\r\nint32\n```\r\nThis is simple to solve; we just need to set `schema` to an empty schema for all scalar expressions.",

Scalars have a type so a ScalarExpression or whatever should be able to surface that. `[~bkietz]` \u00a0what do you think?"
