        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3538](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3538). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSay I have a pandas DataFrame\u00a0`df`\u00a0that I would like to store on disk as dataset using pyarrow parquet, I would do this:\r\n```java\n\r\ntable = pyarrow.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\npyarrow.parquet.write_to_dataset(table, root_path=some_path, partition_cols=['a',])\n```\r\nOn disk the dataset would look like something like this:\r\n <font color=\"#14892c\">some_path</font>\r\n <font color=\"#14892c\">\u251c\u2500\u2500 a=1</font>\r\n <font color=\"#14892c\">____\u251c\u2500\u2500 4498704937d84fe5abebb3f06515ab2d.parquet</font>\r\n <font color=\"#14892c\">\u251c\u2500\u2500 a=2</font>\r\n <font color=\"#14892c\">____\u251c\u2500\u2500 8bcfaed8986c4bdba587aaaee532370c.parquet</font>\r\n\r\n**Wished Feature:**\u00a0It'd be great if I can\u00a0override the auto-assignment of the long UUID as filename somehow during the\u00a0**dataset**\u00a0writing. My purpose is to be able to overwrite the dataset on disk when I have a new version of\u00a0`df`. Currently if I try to write the dataset again, another new uniquely named [UUID].parquet file will be placed next to the old one, with the same, redundant data.",
