Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince hashing doesn't need to know about logical types, we can do the following:\r\n\r\n- Use same generated code for both BinaryType and StringType (and LargeBinary/LargeString)\n- Use same generated code for primitive types having the same byte width\n  \n  These two changes should reduce binary size and improve compilation speed",
