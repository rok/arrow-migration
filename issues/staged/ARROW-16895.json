Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-8049, we upgraded bundled Thrift to 0.13, which bumped the minimum required cmake to 3.10. But since that was written as a number and not a version string in the R code that checks for the cmake version (https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/76d3c36006162766ec598442a0c0d2192f5e0d0b#diff-8345393f38ffaf553909d5bce167e2622cdf865a7e03230ba3f8d376588dd151L371), it effectively was dropped to 3.1. So when attempting to build with cmake 3.6 (https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/13425), the script wrongly used it instead of downloading a newer cmake.",
