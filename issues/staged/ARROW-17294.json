Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI just executed the remove old artifacts release script which also removed the previously created three patch releases for 6.0.2, 7.0.1, 8.0.1. \r\n\r\nThat's not desirable since those have just been released so I had to revert to an earlier revision.\r\n\r\ncc `[~kou]` `[~assignUser]` `[~raulcd]`",
