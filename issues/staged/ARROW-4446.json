For windows, the expectation is IANA database is downloaded into the required location as specified below.\r\n\r\nREF : <https://howardhinnant.github.io/date/tz.html>\r\n\r\n1. USE_OS_TZDB : If\u00a0`USE_OS_TZDB`\u00a0is\u00a0`1`\u00a0then this library will use the zic-compiled time zone database provided by your OS. This option relieves you of having to install the IANA time zone database, either manually, or automatically with\u00a0`AUTO_DOWNLOAD`. This option is not available on Windows.\r\n\r\n2.\u00a0If the macro\u00a0`INSTALL`\u00a0is not defined, the default location of the database is\u00a0`~/Downloads/tzdata`(`%homedrive%\\%homepath%\\downloads\tzdata`\u00a0on Windows).\r\n\r\n3.\u00a0On Windows,\u00a0`HAS_REMOTE_API`\u00a0defaults to\u00a0`0`. Everywhere else it defaults to\u00a0`1`. This is because\u00a0[`libcurl`](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)\u00a0comes preinstalled everywhere but Windows, but it is available for Windows.\r\n\r\n4. If you want to enable\u00a0`HAS_REMOTE_API`\u00a0and/or\u00a0`AUTO_DOWNLOAD`\u00a0on Windows you will have to manually install\u00a0[curl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)\u00a0and\u00a0[7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)\u00a0into their default locations.\r\n\r\n5. If you do not enable\u00a0`HAS_REMOTE_API`, you will need to also install\u00a0<http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml>\u00a0into your\u00a0`install`\u00a0location. This will be done for you if you have enabled\u00a0`HAS_REMOTE_API`\u00a0and let\u00a0`AUTO_DOWNLOAD`\u00a0default to 1."
