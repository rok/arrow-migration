Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~thisisnic]` found that this example crashes:\r\n```java\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nwrite_dataset(group_by(iris, Species), \"iris_data\")\r\nopen_dataset(\"iris_data\") %>%\r\n\u00a0 group_by(Species) %>%\r\n\u00a0 summarise(mean(Sepal.Length)) %>%\r\n\u00a0 collect()\u00a0 \n```\r\nThere are two bugs here:\r\n \\* StopProducing is written in a way that causes a future to be finished twice, triggering a DCHECK.\r\n \\* Consume() doesn't set the length of the key column batch, causing a spurious error because the group ID datum and the values datum will have different lengths.",
