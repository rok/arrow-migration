Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis method would produce a new table since table objects are immutable. Example:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nnew_column = table.column(name).cast(pa.timestamp('ms'))\r\nnew_table = table.set_column(name, new_column)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2129#issuecomment-396423002",
