        "title": "[Python] An independent Cython package for Cython-based projects that want to program against the C data interface",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8945](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8945). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've been thinking it would be useful to have a minimal Cython package, call it \"cyarrow\", containing some pxd files and a small amount of compiled pyx code (using a C compiler only) that enables projects written in Cython to interact with Arrow datasets in minimal ways (for example, iterating over their values, interacting with dictionary-encoded/categorical arrays) that don't amount to reimplementation of the \"hard stuff\" where they would want to utilize pyarrow or the C++ library instead. Otherwise, every Python project that has compiled code in Cython and wants to use the C interface (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/format/CDataInterface.rst) would have to create their own minimal implementation. \r\n\r\nTarget user for this project would be Python projects like scikit-learn that are mostly written in Cython",
