        "title": "[C++][Compute] Enhance FunctionOptions with equality, debug representability, and serializability",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13025](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13025). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the `FunctionOptions` interface is entirely opaque. It would be useful to add \r\n\r\n- equality comparability ```Java\n  \n      bool FunctionOptions::Equals(const FunctionOptions& other) const\n      \n  ```\n- debug representation ```Java\n  \n      std::string FunctionOptions::ToString() const\n      \n  ```\n- serializability ```Java\n  \n      Status FunctionOptions::Serialize(io::OutputStream*) const\n  \n      Result<std::unique_ptr<FunctionOptions>>\n          FunctionOptions::Deserialize(io::InputStream*)\n      \n  ``` (or similar)\n  \n  These are already implemented for common instances of `FunctionOptions` in expression.cc, since `Expression` has the above capabilities and may contain a `FunctionOptions`. Making these explicit virtual functions will formalize this ad-hoc\n  code and expose it for direct unit testing.\n  \n  As an added bonus, if options can serialize themselves to JSON then that can be used by Python and other bindings to generate wrappers instead of the current hand-written listing of wrapper classes for each `FunctionOptions` subclass",
