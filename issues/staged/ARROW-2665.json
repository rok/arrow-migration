Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPython lists have an `index(x, start, end)` method to find the first occurence of an element. We should add a method with the same interface supporting Python scalars on the typical triplet `Array/ChunkedArray/Columns`.\r\n\r\nSee also https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists",
