Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome of our tools don't perform well out of the box for filesystems with high latency reads, like cloud blob stores. In such cases, it may be better to use buffered reads with a larger read ahead window. Having a mock filesystem to introduce latency into reads will help with testing / developing APIs for this",
