Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImprove the implementation by:\r\n1. Count the number of 1 bits by long or int, instead of by byte\r\n2. If the number of value count is a multiple of 8, there is no need to process the last byte separately. This makes the code clearer.
