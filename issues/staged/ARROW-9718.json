        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9718](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9718). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe place internally where the \"legacy\" `pyarrow.filesystem` filesystems are still used is in the `pyarrow.parquet` module.\r\n\r\nIt is used in:\r\n\r\n- ParquetWriter\n- ParquetManifest/ParquetDataset\n- write_to_dataset\n  \n  For `ParquetWriter`, we need to update this to work with the new filesystems (since ParquetWriter is not dataset related, and thus won't be deprecated).  \n  For `ParquetManifest`/`ParquetDataset`, it might not need to be updated, since those might get deprecated itself (to be discussed -> ARROW-9720), and when using the `use_legacy_dataset=False` option, it already uses the new datasets.  \n  For `write_to_dataset`, this might depend on how the writing capabilities of the dataset project evolve.\n  \n",
