A smaller reproducer:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(5, 1), columns=pd.Index([1], dtype=object))   \r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)  \r\ntable.to_pandas() \r\n```\r\n\r\nso what triggers this is to have an object-dtype index with integers as the column labels. We try to preserve the dtype of the column labels on roundtrip (that's why we store this in the pandas metadata), but this case is clearly not covered. \r\n\r\nAlways welcome to take a look."
