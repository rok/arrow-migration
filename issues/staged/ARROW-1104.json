Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo exchange arrow data between different processes on a machine, it is beneficial to have a shared-memory object store that acts as a server and can ship shared memory regions to clients, handle reference counting, object eviction as well as provide a unified namespace for objects. Such an object store has been developed as part of Ray (https://github.com/ray-project/ray) and this ticket is about integrating it into Arrow.",
