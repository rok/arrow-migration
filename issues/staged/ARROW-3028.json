Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome things that are probably not necessary:\r\n\r\n- We should build and install the Python library in one place rather than rebuilding it in a new conda environment for the documentation\n- Does matplotlib need to be installed? It pulls in a heavy dependency chain including Qt: https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/meta.yaml#L48",
