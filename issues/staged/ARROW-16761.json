        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16761](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16761). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake tables, we need to be able to get the size of the files written in bytes. In Iceberg, this is the required field\u00a0`file_size_in_bytes` ([docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#manifests)). In Delta, this is the required field `size` as part of the Add action.\r\n\r\nI think this could be exposed on [FileWriter](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/8c63788ff7d52812599a546989b7df10887cb01e/cpp/src/arrow/dataset/file_base.h#L305) and then through that [WrittenFile](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/8c63788ff7d52812599a546989b7df10887cb01e/python/pyarrow/_dataset.pyx#L766-L769). But lower-level than that I'm not yet sure. `FileWriter` owns its `OutputStream`; would `OutputStream::Tell()` give the correct count?",
