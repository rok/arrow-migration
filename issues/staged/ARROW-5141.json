Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome APIs in `arrow/ipc/test-common.h` aren't really IPC-specific. Furthermore, `arrow/ipc/test-common.h` is already included in non-IPC tests. Those APIs should be moved to the Arrow-wide testing utilities.\r\n",
