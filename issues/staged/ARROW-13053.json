        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13053](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13053). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen installing pyarrow 4.0.1 from source, the install step fails with\u00a0\r\n\r\n`error: can't copy 'build/lib.macosx-11.3-arm64-3.9/pyarrow/include/arrow': doesn't exist or not a regular file`\r\n\r\nbecause the headers directory\r\n\r\n`build/lib.macosx-11.3-arm64-3.9/pyarrow/include/arrow`\r\n\r\nis a relative symlink to\u00a0`../Cellar/apache-arrow/4.0.1/include/arrow`\r\n\r\nI believe this is caused by the build system including the header files from `/opt/homebrew/include/arrow`, which is the above symlink:\r\n\r\n{\\{ls -hl /opt/homebrew/include/arrow}}\r\n`lrwxr-xr-x\u00a0 1 dki\u00a0 admin\u00a0 \u00a0 42B Jun\u00a0 8 15:35 /opt/homebrew/include/arrow -> ../Cellar/apache-arrow/4.0.1/include/arrow`\r\n\r\nI was able work around this issue by modifying line 334 in `CMakeLists.txt` from\r\n\r\n`#Always bundle includes`\r\n `file(COPY ${ARROW_INCLUDE_DIR}/arrow DESTINATION ${BUILD_OUTPUT_ROOT_DIRECTORY}/include)`\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n`#Always bundle includes`\r\n `get_filename_component(REAL_ARROW_INCLUDE_DIR \"${ARROW_INCLUDE_DIR}/arrow\" REALPATH)`\r\n `file(COPY ${``REAL_ARROW_INCLUDE_DIR``} DESTINATION ${BUILD_OUTPUT_ROOT_DIRECTORY}/include)`\r\n\r\nBut I'm not familiar with CMake, so maybe there is a more appropriate way to fix this.",
