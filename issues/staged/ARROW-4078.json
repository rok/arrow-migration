Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen only changes to the `docs` directory are made, most Travis jobs are skipped, even the Python job which (presumably) builds the documentation to check for errors etc.\r\n\r\nWe should probably have a separate doc building job, or perhaps make it part of the linting job.",
