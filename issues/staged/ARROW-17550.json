Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMinGW builds currently compile the GCS testbench and grpcio for MinGW.\r\nWhen the compiled MinGW wheel is not in cache, compiling takes a very long time (\\\\*). But Win32 and Win64 binary wheels are available on PyPI.\r\n\r\nThis is pointless: the GCS testbench could simply run with the system Python instead of the msys2 Python, and always use the binaries from PyPI.\r\n\r\n(\\\\*) see for example https://github.com/pitrou/arrow/runs/8071607360 where installing the GCS testbench took 18 minutes\r\n",
