Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFiling this because it has bitten me once or twice. The name `null_buffer` makes me **think** that I'm getting a buffer that indicates (when true) that the corresponding value is null. But in actuality, we get back a buffer that indicates(when true) that the corresponding value is valid.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there is a reason for this discrepancy or if it could make sense to rename `null_buffer` to `valid_buffer`?",
