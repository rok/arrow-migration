        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15914](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15914). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCould we split up the nightly report that has the test builds from the report that has the verification builds (and maybe include all the packaging into the separate verification builds?)\r\n\r\nThe verification builds tend to take much longer than the test builds, so are frequently still pending even with 6 hours between starting the test builds and running the report.",
