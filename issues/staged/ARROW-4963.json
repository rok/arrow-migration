I will try to produce a complete log when I can to illustrate. I am using this command:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n   cmake -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64\" ^\r\n         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%ARROW_HOME% ^\r\n         -DARROW_CXXFLAGS=\"/WX /MP\" ^\r\n         -DARROW_GANDIVA=on ^\r\n         -DARROW_ORC=on ^\r\n         -DARROW_PARQUET=on ^\r\n         -DARROW_PYTHON=on ..\r\n   cmake --build . --target INSTALL --config Release\r\n```",
