        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9539](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9539). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn 2020-07-15 I've updated the FreeBSD port ```0.17.1 -> 1.0.0```. The tarball size was 6425963 and the sha256 hash was 95c481522334bcd2ff17062f3d642e87d41df00bac119f575bcf7cf99e546351.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNow your GitHub repository says that ```1.0.0``` tag was created yesterday, and the tarball size is now 6427963.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs a result the port breaks now. Did you re-create the 1.0.0 tag? Why didn't you instead create a new release?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCould you please create a new release so that the port can be updated properly?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
