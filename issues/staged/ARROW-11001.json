        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11001). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, we allow dropping/adding columns when scanning the actual sources of a Dataset (e.g. if newer files in the dataset have additional columns), but we should also provide a way to specify fields that are renamed in certain files of the dataset.\r\n\r\nWhile it _might_ be possible to also provide some convenience for this in the discovery factories, it's probably best to start to see how this could be added to the actual `Dataset` class and the lower-level constructor functionalities (such as `FileSystemDataset` main constructor from fragments or `from_paths`). \r\n\r\nWhat I am thinking right now, is that we would need an (optional) mapping of \"field ref/name in physical schema -> name in projected/dataset schema\" for each fragment of a dataset. \r\nHowever, that might not fully fit in the current design, as the fragment doesn't know about the dataset schema, but only sees this when it is projected. \r\n\r\ncc `[~bkietz]`",
