        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14661](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14661). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen used with GCC < 4.9, the error:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n> tf <- tempfile()\r\n  > on.exit(unlink(tf))\r\n  > write_parquet(mtcars, tf)\r\n  > df <- read_parquet(tf, col_select = starts_with(\"d\"))\r\n  Error: IOError: Corrupt snappy compressed data.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though the compressed data is just fine and can be read by other versions of Arrow/snappy so long as they are not GCC < 4.9\r\n\r\n`[~apitrou]` suggested this is possible a compiler bug manifesting. \r\n\r\nNote: Snappy 1.1.8 [has a sanitizer error](https://github.com/google/snappy/commit/041c608086d00ceb8285b91f034cfa8b84c83d7c), so enabling and using that by default + sending to  CRAN would be problematic",
