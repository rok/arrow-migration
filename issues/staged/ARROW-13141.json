        "title": "[C++][Python] HadoopFileSystem: automatically set CLASSPATH based on HADOOP_HOME env variable?",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13141](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13141). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the \"legacy\" python-specific HadoopFileSystem implementation, we have a `_maybe_set_hadoop_classpath` function which has some logic to set the `CLASSPATH` environment variable based on `HADOOP_HOME` or the hadoop executable: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/c43fab3d621bedef15470a1be43570be2026af20/python/pyarrow/hdfs.py#L134-L149\r\n\r\nThis is also mentioned in the documentation of the new HadoopFileSystem (https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/filesystems.html#hadoop-file-system-hdfs ):\r\n\r\n> If CLASSPATH is not set, then it will be set automatically if the hadoop executable is in your system path, or if HADOOP_HOME is set.\r\n\r\nHowever, this sentence was probably simply copied over from the docs about the legacy filesystem. And for the new HadoopFileSystem implementation, we don't have this logic to automatically set up `CLASSPATH`. \r\n\r\nDo we want to add this logic to the new implementation as well? (in cython, or actually in C++?) Or if not, we should update the docs to clarify that `CLASSPATH` is actually required.\r\n\r\ncc `[~apitrou]`",

For example on a Unix shell:\r\n```Java\n\r\nexport CLASSPATH=$($HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop classpath --glob)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a Windows shell this might be (untested):\r\n```Java\n\r\n%HADOOP_HOME%/bin/hadoop classpath --glob > %CLASSPATH%\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The windows version could be added.\r\n\r\nI can't judge how useful this automatic setting is (to what extent users already need to deal with this env variable, or whether they otherwise only need to set HADOOP/JAVA_HOME, etc), but so if it is complicated/costly, I am personally certainly fine with simply updating the documentation to reflect the current situation that CLASSPATH is required.
