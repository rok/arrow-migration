Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCrossbow was originally designed to checkout a specific hash, but the gandiva-jars required a different checkout approach where arrow-sha is omitted. We need to update the checkout step in the macros.jinja file to use specific commit ids rather than the FETCH_HEAD.",
