But for starters, I've wrapped the C library and written some examples here <https://github.com/jo8hua/arrow/tree/master/c_glib/example/rust.>\u00a0It is definitely not complete.\u00a0"

MemoryPool\n1. Buffer\n1. Builder\n1. Array\n   \n   The biggest divergence from cpp that I see is the implementation of the memory pool. Implementing MemoryPool would result in unsafe code being used in Rust (which is bad obviously). There is an issue open to modify memory alignment of structs: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33626.>\u00a0I think that it would be well worth skipping the memory alignment until this development is finished.\u00a0"

It will take a longer time until we have all integration tests set up but there is no benefit in keeping the issue open."
