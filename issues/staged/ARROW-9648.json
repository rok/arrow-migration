        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9648](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9648). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\r\n\r\nI am currently checking the different compression codecs available when writing parquet files.\r\n\r\nTesting LZ4, I got the error message that compression level is not supported.\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n\r\nfrom pyarrow import parquet as pq\r\n\r\npq.write_table(data, file, compression='LZ4', compression_level=12)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nError message\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\n\r\n\r\n File \"pyarrow/_parquet.pyx\", line 1374, in pyarrow._parquet.ParquetWriter.write_table\r\n\r\nFile \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 99, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\n\r\nOSError: Invalid: LZ4 doesn't support setting a compression level.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever man page of LZ4 states the following\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\n\r\nOperation modifiers\r\n -# Compression level, with # being any value from 1 to 12. Higher\r\n values trade compression speed for compression ratio. Values\r\n above 12 are considered the same as 12. Recommended values are 1\r\n for fast compression (default), and 9 for high compression.\r\n Speed/compression trade-off will vary depending on data to com\u2010\r\n press. Decompression speed remains fast at all settings.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease, can you activate compression levels for LZ4?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBests\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

This wouldn't apply to Parquet therefore (which uses the LZ4 block format), but would apply to Arrow IPC (which uses the LZ4 frame format)."
