        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6835](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6835). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is used by developers to fasten the cmake build creation and loosen the required installed toolchains (notably libraries). This was yanked because ARROW_LINT_ONLY effectively exit-early and doesn't generate `compile_commands.json`.\r\n\r\nRestore this option, but ensure that archery toggles accordingly to the usage of iwyu or clang-tidy.",
