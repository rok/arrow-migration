Apparently Conda packaged it on a platform with VS2019 Enterprise installed.\r\n\r\nI am not familiar with Conda at all. Any idea where I should report this bug to? CC `[~lidavidm]` `[~apitrou]` `[~kou]` \u00a0\r\n\r\n~~For now I will disable Gandiva build on AppVeyor.~~\r\n\r\nFor now I will pin LLVM's version to 14 on AppVeyor as per kou's suggestion."
