Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe purpose of this class will be to forward certain function calls to the parent buffer, like a request for the device (CPU, GPU, etc.).\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, we can remove the `parent_` member from `Buffer` as that member is only there to support slices.
