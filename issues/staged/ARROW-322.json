        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-322](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-322). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently if you have not built `arrow::io` with `-DARROW_HDFS=on` then importing `pyarrow.parquet` fails with a not very graceful error message from failure to find the right symbols in `libarrow_io.so`. Since we vendor `hdfs.h` and the libraries are loaded at runtime, having this extra option doesn't add much value. ",

If it becomes an issue for some reason in the future, we can split it out into a leaf shared library"
