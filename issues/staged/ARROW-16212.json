        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16212). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current UDF integration (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15639)\u00a0doesn't support multiple kernel registration. It only supports registering a single kernel under a given function name. Enabling multiple kernels to be registered under the same function name is a must for usability and consistency with the existing functions in the function registry.\u00a0",
