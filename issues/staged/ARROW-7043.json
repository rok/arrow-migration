Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi, thanks great for building Arrow firstly, I find this project from wes's post :\u00a0<https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/>\r\n\r\nhis ambition on building arrow for fixing problems in pandas really attract my eyes.\r\n\r\nbellow is my problems:\r\n\r\nbackground:\r\n \\* Our team's analytic work deeply rely on pandas, we often read large csv files into memory and do kinds of analytic work.\r\n \\* We have faced problems which mentioned in wes's post, espcially `pandas rule of thumb: have 5 to 10 times as much RAM as the size of your dataset`\r\n \\* We are looking for some technics which can help us on load our csv(or other format, like msgpack, parquet, or something else), using as little as memory.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nexperiment:\r\n \\* luckily I find arrow, and I did a simple test.\r\n \\* input file: a 1.5GB csv file, around 6 million records, 15 columns;\r\n \\* using pandas bellow, which will consume about **1GB memory**,\r\n \\* \r\n```java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\ndf = pd.read_csv(filename)\n```\r\n\r\n \\* using pyarrow bellow, which will consume about **3.6GB memory,** which really makes me confused.\r\n \\* \r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow\r\nimport pyarrow.csv\r\ntable = pyarrow.csv.read_csv(filename)\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nproblems:\r\n \\* why pyarrow will need so much memory for reading just 1.5GB csv data, it really disappoints me.\r\n \\* and when pyarrow is reading the file, my 8 Core CPU is full used.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nenvironments:\r\n \\* ubuntu 16\r\n \\* python 3.5, ipython 6.5\r\n \\* pandas, 0.20\r\n \\* pyarrow, 0.15\r\n \\* server 8 core, 16 GB\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTest File:\r\n \\* <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WmUd_NJUIES58bO8mDNd77nf2JVsEu_r/view?usp=sharing>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\ngreat thanks again.\r\n\r\nif needed, I can upload my 1.5GB file later.",
