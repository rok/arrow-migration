Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBuilds are currently non-deterministic because rust-toolchain contains \"nightly\" meaning \"use the latest nightly release of Rust\". This can cause build seemingly random build failure in CI. I propose we modify rust-toolchain to refer to a specific nightly release e.g. \"nightly-2019-07-31\" so that builds are deterministic.\r\n\r\nWe can update this nightly version when needed (e.g. to pick up new features) as part of the regular PR process.",
