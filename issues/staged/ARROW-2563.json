        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2563](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2563). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince the Rust project isn't at the repo root, Travis-CI won't compiled cache artifacts by default. This leads to long CI times as all packages get recompiled (see https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/#Rust-Cargo-cache for what gets cached).\r\n\r\nIn https://travis-ci.org/pitrou/arrow/jobs/376859806 I tried the following:\r\n```Java\n\r\nexport CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/target\r\n```\r\n\r\nand after a first run, the build time went down to 2 minutes (from 15-18 minutes).",

Feel free to try on your side. The branch I tried this on is unrelated, I was just surprised by the Rust compilation times and experimented a bit."
