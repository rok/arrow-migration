        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9839). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSometimes it is necessary to have operator-specific logic in a query optimizer, so we need the ability to get an Any reference to an ExecutionPlan so we can downcast it.\r\n\r\nWe do something very similar in PrimitiveArray already with an as_any method but the difference there is we can call get_type first to know exactly what type to cast to and we don't have anything like that in ExecutionPlan, but we could at least speculatively\u00a0 try casting to specific operators.",
