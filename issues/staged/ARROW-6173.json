Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I create a new environment in conda:\r\n```java\n\r\nconda create -n pyarrow-test python=3.7 pyarrow=0.14.1\r\n```\r\nand try to read a csv file:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\npa.csv.read_csv('test.csv')\n```\r\nit fails with an error:\r\n```java\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nAttributeError: module 'pyarrow' has no attribute 'csv'\r\n```\r\nHowever, loading it directly works:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow.csv as pc\r\ntable = pc.read_csv('test.csv')\r\n```\r\nand using pa.csv.read_csv() after loading it directly also works.",

It is the default behaviour for all submodules - feather, json, plasma, orc (some of which aren't built for conda) - it makes sense only to load what you need."
