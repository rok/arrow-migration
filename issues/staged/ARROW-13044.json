Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was going to try using a DenseUnionVector as the underlying vector of an extension type but it's not currently possible because ExtensionTypeVector has a type constraint for the underlying storage to extend BaseValueVector and the union vectors do not extend this class.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible for UnionVector and DenseUnionVector to extend AbstractContainerVector, which is a subclass of ValueVector, then relax the type constraint for an ExtensionTypeVector to use the ValueVector interface.",
