        "title": "[MATLAB] Integrate GoogleTest with MATLAB Interface C++ Code",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13100](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13100). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe MATLAB Interface for Apache Arrow will call into C++ code via MEX functions to interact with the Arrow C++ libraries.\r\n\r\nAll of the C++ APIs that will support the MATLAB Interface will require corresponding C++ tests to go with them.\r\n\r\nWe would like to reuse the CMake GoogleTest integration code that has already been authored in\u00a0[cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake) to enable us to author and execute C++ tests for the MATLAB Interface.\r\n\r\nWe imagine supporting two kinds of GoogleTest integration workflows:\r\n1. A user provided\u00a0[GTEST_ROOT](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindGTest.html) value to pre-built Google-Test binaries (e.g. GoogleTest binaries that were built as part of building the Arrow C++ libraries).\n1. Automatic fetching/building of GoogleTest using [ExternalProject](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html) From what we can tell, we should be able to reuse the\u00a0[build_dependency macro](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/57ecc73e6153fea04e0ac0d13792ba0abb0dd779/cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake#L137) `declared in ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake` to do this.",
