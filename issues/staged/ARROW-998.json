Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe documentation for the file format makes it look like the schema is at the beginning of the file, since it \"contains\" the streaming format (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/IPC.md#file-format), but in reality the schema is in the footer (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/File.fbs#L29)",

I think I got tripped up because I expected the Schema Message to be at byte 8, but it looks like the C++ lib is placing it at 64 (js/spec/simple.arrow and struct-example.arrow). It looks like the Java lib is placing the schema header immediately after the magic bytes without any padding though (js/spec/dictionary.arrow)."
