Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be convenient to have a utility as part of the benchmark crate for converting generated TPC-H tbl files into CSV and Parquet files so that we can easily run benchmarks on these different file formats without relying on third party software to perform the conversions.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the tool would also perform re-partitioning of the data so that the user can specify how many partitions to generate.",
