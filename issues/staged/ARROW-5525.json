Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince fuzzing kinda only works if done as a continuous background job, we should find a way of doing so. This likely requires another service than Travis. Basic requirements are:\r\n \\* master builds should be submitted for fuzzing\r\n \\* project members should be informed about new crashes (ideally not via public issue due to potential security impact)",

That (to my understanding) must be done by the Fuzzit support team ( `[~yevgenyp]` ?)."

One thing that we might change is to add some known arrow files to the seed corpus so we don't solely rely on the fuzzer to find valid files during the exploration.\r\n> Also a lot was changed since we first integrated apache-arrow so if fuzzing is a again a priority I would love to help - transfer apache/arrow to new organisation (the old one was deprecated.) and update the Fuzzit CLI to latest version.\r\nThat would help a lot I think."
