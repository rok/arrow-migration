Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe integration tests create several directories with a few hundred files.  This was motivated by the original implementation of `DeleteDir` and `DeleteDirContents` which used the own thread pools to delete the objects.  I wanted to exercise the flow control code in those thread pools.\r\n\r\nDuring the review `[~apitrou]` proposed a much better design, which does not need explicit flow control, and therefore does not need these large directories.  Reducing the size of these directories would reduce the running time to a few seconds.",
