        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1796](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1796). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe can build upon the API defined in `fastparquet` for defining RowGroup filters: https://github.com/dask/fastparquet/blob/master/fastparquet/api.py#L296-L300 and translate them into the C++ enums we will define in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1158 . This should enable us to provide the user with a simple predicate pushdown API that we can extend in the background from RowGroup to Page level later on.",

The pure Python pass is much simpler as a first step and provides already a working interface at acceptable performance."

This will be\u00a0in\u00a0disjunctive normal form representation. The innermost triples consist of `(column_name, operation, value(s))`, e.g. `('name', '==', 'John')`. These innermost triples are combined into a list and all predicates in this list and combined with `AND`. The outer list is then an `OR` combination of the `AND`-combined triples."

I would like to point out it would be nice if it would be possible to apply it at the ParquetDataset level as well extending the filter parameter that already exists to handle both hive partitions and row group level filtering <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L777>\u00a0It could do this by using the summary _metadata file or by reading all footers."
