Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent variance kernel converts all data type to `double` before calculation. It's sub-optimal for integers. Integer arithmetic is much faster than floating points, e.g., summation is 4x faster [1].\r\n\r\nA quick test for calculating int32 variance shows up to 3x performance gain. Another benefit is that integer arithmetic is accurate.\r\n\r\n[1] https://quick-bench.com/q/_Sz-Peq1MNWYwZYrTtQDx3GI7lQ",
