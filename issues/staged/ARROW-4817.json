Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current code organization is a little inconsistent. We had a dedicated package for query optimization but no package for SQL support, which is just one API and we will soon have a new Table/DataFrame API which is an alternative, but will leverage the same logical plan and query optimizer, so I plan on moving things around a little.",
