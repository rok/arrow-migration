Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer this GitHub issue: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/4016>\r\n\r\n**The request:**\u00a0API docs for previous PyArrow versions as a drop-down link in the sidebar of this page:\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api.html>\r\n\r\nI\u00a0often work in multiple environments with PyArrow versions ranging from 0.8.0 to 0.12+, and the core Python API has changed quite a bit version-to-version so code occasionally no longer works. It can be difficult to hunt down the corresponding changes in each version. Versioned docs similar to pandas and other popular libraries would be excellent.",
