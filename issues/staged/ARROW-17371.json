Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is an NSE func mapping between `base::as.factor` and Acero's `dictionary_encode`.  However, it doesn't work at present - see ARROW-12632.  Calling this function results in an error.  We should remove this mapping so that an error is raised and we call `as.factor` in R not Acero.",
