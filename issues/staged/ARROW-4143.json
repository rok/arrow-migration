        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4143). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIs there any functionality in pyarrow\u00a0that allows reading the file partially. Means if I wish to read only the first 10 rows from the parquet file.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI got this situation while doing this:\r\n\r\n`df = pd.read_parquet(path= 'filepath', nrows = 10)`\u00a0 #Gave me error\r\n\r\nI wanted to read just the 10 rows into pandas dataframe using the read_parquet, (read_parquet uses pyarrow as one of the engines to read parquet file). As the parquet file is considerably huge in size, if one wants to read only a few n rows is there any functionality we can add in the engine to do so?",
