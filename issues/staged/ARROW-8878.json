The other alternative would be to install the arrow system packages (see http://arrow.apache.org/install/). You'll need at least libarrow-dataset-dev and libparquet-dev.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, what does `getOption(\"download.file.method\")` return for you?"

Please see below:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n \\* getOption(\"download.file.method\") returns wget\r\n \\* sorry for the low-tech question, but can I install manually without cloning? That is, simply going to the github page\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow>, manually downloading the zip and then installing using the \"install from zip\" utility in Rstudio? Would that work correctly?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

Is the package self-contained? Why does it need to download a couple extra files like 'distro-map.csv'?
