        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4442](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4442). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTypescript is\u00a0generating\u00a0an overly broad type for the `typeId` property of the ChunkedVector class, leading to a type mismatch and failure to infer Column<T> is Vector<T>:\r\n\r\n\r\n```actionscript\n\r\n\r\nlet col: Vector<Utf8>;\r\ncol = new Chunked(new Utf8());\r\n  ^\r\n/*\r\nArgument of type 'Chunked<Utf8>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Vector<Utf8>'.\r\n  Type 'Chunked<Utf8>' is not assignable to type 'Vector<Utf8>'.\r\n    Types of property 'typeId' are incompatible.\r\n      Type 'Type' is not assignable to type 'Type.Utf8'.\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add an explicit return annotation to the Chunked typeId getter.",
