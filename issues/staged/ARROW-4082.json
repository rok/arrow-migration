Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSetupCxxFlags.cmake does not list \"RELWITHDEBINFO\" in the [final flag setup](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L363), so cmake will error out if that build config is selected. It's handy for quick debugging without switching your python build etc over to \"DEBUG\".\r\n\r\nFindClangTools.cmake could check the version of 'clang-format' (no version suffix) to see if it satisfies a version requirement.",
