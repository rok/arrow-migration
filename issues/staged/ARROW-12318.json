        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12318](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12318). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a follow on to ARROW-12277\r\n\r\nBackground: Support for Min/Max/Sum/Count were added for DataType::Timestamp(\\*) types in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9970.\r\n\r\nThis ticket tracks adding support for Avg, which is slightly more involved as currently Avg assumes the output type is always F64, and in this case I think Avg(timestamp) should also be (timestamp). We should double check what postgres does in this case and follow its example\r\n",
