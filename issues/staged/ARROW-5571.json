Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSo that it's similar to how we deal with ARROW_R_WITH_ARROW\r\n\r\nperhaps instead of functions like arrow_available(), parquet_available(), ... we could have a single function returning a list, e.g.\u00a0\r\n```Java\n\r\narrow::capabilities()\r\n#> $arrow\r\n#> [1] TRUE\r\n#> $parquet\r\n#> [1] TRUE\r\n```",
