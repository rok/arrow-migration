Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOnce the packaging thread reaches a stable state and we have the ability to run non-packaging nightly tests, we should set up a Docker build on Ubuntu 18.04 (which is based on gcc 7.3) so we can keep that build clean. It may be a while until we have any Travis CI entries that use Bionic / 18.04",
