Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was testing pulling a dataset from S3 and saving it to a local (possibly re partitioned) copy.\u00a0 Ideally I would do this with an async scan but it fails with \"This scanner does not support the legacy Scan() method\" because FileSystemDataset::Write is still using Scan.",
