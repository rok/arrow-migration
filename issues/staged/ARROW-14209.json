        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14209). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13620 and\u00a0ARROW-14036 added support for the `n_distinct()`\u00a0function in the dplyr verb `summarise()`\u00a0but only with a single argument. Add support for multiple arguments to `n_distinct()`. This should return the number of unique combinations of values in the specified columns/expressions.\r\n\r\nSee the comment about this here:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11257#discussion_r720873549>",
