        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10297](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10297). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen analyzing data related issues I found it really helpful to filter or portprocess the contents of parquet files on the command line using jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/).\r\n\r\nCurrently the output of parquet-read is in a custom json-like format, I propose to add an optional flag that outputs the contents as json using the serde_json library. This should probably be behind a feature gate to avoid adding the dependency for everyone.",
