        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10222](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10222). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMaking the transform FS -> URI bijective would greatly simplify unambiguous location of files and serialization of filesystems. Something like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nResult<std::string> FileSystem::MakeUri(std::string path = \"/\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nDifficulties:\r\n-  SubTreeFileSystem::MakeUri(\"/\") would probably return a URI referring to its base directory in the wrapped filesystem, which wouldn't roundtrip to a SubTreeFileSystem with FileSystemFromUri\n- Not all of s3's parameters are supported in a URI",
