        "title": "[Python][Gandiva] Infer return types for make_if and make_in_expression",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12129](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12129). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn the `TreeExprBuilder` in `pyarrow.gandiva`, both the `make_if` and `make_in_expression` require the user to specify the return type. These could easily be inferred from the input values. ARROW-11342 exposes the return type of nodes as a method, so this should be easy to do once that is merged.\r\n\r\nTo keep the changes backwards compatible, we can make the return_type an optional argument.",
