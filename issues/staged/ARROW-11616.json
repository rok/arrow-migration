Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe DataFrame API has a `collect` method which invokes the `collect(plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>) -> Result<Vec<RecordBatch>>` function which will collect records into a single vector of RecordBatches removing the partitioning via `MergeExec`.\r\n\r\nThe DataFrame should also expose the `collect_partitioned` method so that partitions can be maintained.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncollect_partitioned(\r\n    plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>,\r\n) -> Result<Vec<Vec<RecordBatch>>> \r\n```",
