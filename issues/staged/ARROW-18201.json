        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18201](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18201). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14415 arrow's version of substrait will be a specific git hash instead of a released version. As soon as a released version is available which includes https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/pull/342 we should update to depend on that, in order to minimize build up of divergence between arrow's consumption of substrait and its released API.",
