Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should add logic to combine and possibly slice/re-chunk and uniformly partition chunks into separate RecordBatches. This will make it easier to create Tables or RecordBatches from Vectors of different lengths. This is also necessary for `Table#assign()`. PR incoming.",
