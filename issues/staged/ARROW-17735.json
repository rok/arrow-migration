Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImprove parquet reading performance for String/Binary type based on Buffer operations instead of BinaryArrayBuilder.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently, parquet String/Binary type reading performance is not good enough. For fixedwidth types, the Reader has adopted Buffer operations\u00a0 instead of ArrayBuilder interfaces.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo it\u2018s better to use Buffer operations in String/Binary type reading.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
