Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be simpler to assess the raw performance of parquet-cpp Parquet scans to have something akin to https://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp/blob/master/tools/parquet-scan.cc available as a callable Python function. This way we can isolate the performance of scanning the file from converting it to Arrow (and to pandas)",
