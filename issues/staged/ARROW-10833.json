Currently this is blocking us.\r\n\r\nSimpler reproducer is:\r\n```java\n\r\npython -m pip install pyarrow==2.0.0 numpy\r\npython\r\n>>> import pyarrow\r\n>>> pyarrow.from_numpy_dtype(int)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"pyarrow/types.pxi\", line 2544, in pyarrow.lib.from_numpy_dtype\r\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 107, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: Did not pass numpy.dtype object\n```\r\n\u00a0"
