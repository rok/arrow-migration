Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe setup.py + example.pyx given in the docs:\r\n\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/extending.html#example>\r\n\r\ndoesn't work on macOS.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first issue is the error:\r\n\r\n**example.cpp:603:10:** **fatal error:** **'unordered_map' file not found**\r\n\r\nbecause (AFAIU) macOS clang doesn't include the required C++11 lib by default.\r\n\r\nThis can be solved by adding:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nos.environ['CFLAGS'] = '-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++'\r\n```\r\nto setup.py\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that the line\r\n```java\n\r\next.library_dirs.append(pa.get_library_dirs())\r\n```\r\nshould be\u00a0\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\next.library_dirs.extend(pa.get_library_dirs())\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\notherwise this causes a (completely uninformative) typerror during the build because library dirs ends up being a list of list instead of a list of string.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
