Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe TransferPair interface is important to the Java vector module's memory management, but there is only a single line class comment, and no comments for the methods. The implementations of those methods have subtitles that are hidden in the method names. For example, the method transferTo() clears the memory in the original vector and resets the rowCount to 0, but splitAndTransferTo() only copies the values into new memory and the original is unchanged.\u00a0\u00a0",
