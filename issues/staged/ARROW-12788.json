Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a function `type()` that returns the type of a post-bind `Expression` as a `std::shared_ptr<arrow::DataType>`:\r\n <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/exec/expression.h#L105>\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient to also have a function `type_id()` that returns this as an\u00a0`arrow::Type::type`.",
