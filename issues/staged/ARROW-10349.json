Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe currently released source distribution for Arrow on pypi.org doesn't build on Ubuntu 20.04. It may be possible install additional build dependencies to make it work, but it would be better to publish aarch64 (arm64) wheels to pypi.org in addition to the currently published x86_64 wheels for Linux.\r\n\r\n`$ pip install pyarrow`\r\n\r\nshould just work on Linux/aarch64.",

Travis-CI.com is the only CI currently in use by Apache Arrow that supports Arm64 builds on linux. Guidance on the necessary changes to CI/Travis code would be appreciated."
