Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPR merging tool applies \"Resolve Issue\" action to the jira issue when PR is merged.[1]\r\n\"Resolve Issue\" can only be applied to open issues, not an issue in-progress.\r\nIn the web UI, there's no \"Resolve Issue\" button for a jira in progress.\r\nSo if you clicked \"Start Progress\" button of an open issue, that issue will not be resolved by the PR merging script. This looks to me a bug of Jira.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/merge_arrow_pr.py#L202-L203",
