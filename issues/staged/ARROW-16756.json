Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is essential to reduce microperformance overhead as has been discussed and investigated many other places. This first stage of work is to remove the use of `Datum` and `ExecBatch` from the input side of only scalar kernels, so that we can work toward using span/view data structures as the inputs (and eventually outputs) of all kernels.
