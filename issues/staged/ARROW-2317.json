Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using pyarrow interface from a c++ library one will get the following compiler warning:\r\n> `warning: 'unwrap_table' has C-linkage specified, but returns user-defined type 'arrow::Status' which is incompatible with C [-Wreturn-type-c-linkage]`\n> `ARROW_EXPORT Status unwrap_table(PyObject* table, std::shared_ptr<Table>* out);`\r\nThis is due to a Cython artifact.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
