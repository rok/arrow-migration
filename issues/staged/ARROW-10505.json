        "title": "[Python] Improve validation of cython arguments",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10505). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTyping parameters in cython functions (for example\r\n```java\n\r\ndef validate(self, Schema schema not None):\r\n```\r\n)\r\n is intuitive but provides uninformative error messages when the type doesn't match expectations. See `FileSystemDataset.from_paths` (ARROW-8290) for an instance of manual validation to make a high traffic function more friendly.\r\n```java\n\r\n        for arg, class_, name in [\r\n            (schema, Schema, 'schema'),\r\n            (format, FileFormat, 'format'),\r\n            (filesystem, FileSystem, 'filesystem'),\r\n            (root_partition, Expression, 'root_partition')\r\n        ]:\r\n            if not isinstance(arg, class_):\r\n                raise TypeError(\r\n                    \"Argument '{0}' has incorrect type (expected {1}, \"\r\n                    \"got {2})\".format(name, class_.__name__, type(arg))\r\n                )\r\n```\r\nIt seems we could do better by applying a validating decorator:\r\n```python\n\r\n@param_types(schema=Schema, format=Format, filesystem=FileSystem,\r\n             root_partition=(None,Expression))\r\ndef from_paths(paths, schema, format,\r\n               filesystem, partitions, root_partition):\r\n```\r\nThis seems compact enough to add to any or all `def functions`, improving error messages and hiding validation boilerplate.",

I can try to do that next week)"
