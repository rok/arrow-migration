Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be really great to have an API which can write a Table to a `FeatherDataset`. Essentially, taking a name for a file - it would split the table into N-equal parts (which could be determined by the user or the code) and then write the data to N files with a suffix (which is `_part` by default but could be user specificed).",

Its just not obvious how to do this without a `slice` function for a table. Would you advise I implement that first and then the FeatherDataset writer?"
