Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-15857 we fixed the nightly failures on rhub/fedora-clang-devel by a kludge modifying the default makefile, but also upstreamed the fixes (https://github.com/rstudio/sass/pull/104 and https://github.com/r-hub/rhub-linux-builders/pull/60). These upstreams are now both released, so we can remove the kludge from modification of the docker image.",

But anyway I found that we can't yet remove all of the Makevars munging because we edit LDFLAGS and others to be sure that libc++ and only libc++ is used."
