        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12886](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12886). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen building the Arrow library _without_ using vcpkg on a Windows system that has vcpkg installed, msbuild emits this message repeatedly during the build:\r\n> `The vcpkg manifest was disabled, but we found a manifest file in $(VcpkgManifestRoot). You may want to enable vcpkg manifests in your properties page or pass /p:VcpkgEnableManifest=true to the msbuild invocation.`\r\nThis is of no consequence but it's annoying. See if we can configure the cmake files to add `/p:VcpkgEnableManifest=false` to the compiler flags to suppress this message when vcpkg is not being used for dependencies.\r\n\r\nE.g. in `SetupCxxFlags.cmake`, add a conditional like this, including a status message.\r\n```java\n\r\nif(MSVC AND NOT ARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE STREQUAL \"VCPKG\")\r\n  message(STATUS \"Disabling the vcpkg manifest. To enable the vcpkg manifest, set -DARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=VCPKG\")\r\n  set(CXX_COMMON_FLAGS \"${CXX_COMMON_FLAGS} /p:VcpkgEnableManifest=false\")\r\nendif()\n```\r\n\u00a0",
