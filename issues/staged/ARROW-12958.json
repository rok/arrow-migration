Create some\u00a0hosting location where docs can be served out of. Perhaps it should automatically clean up anything 30 days or older.\n1. Create a crossbow job that builds the docs and uploads to the hosting location.\n   \n   One solution to (1) is using an S3 bucket to statically host the site, and implement [lifecycle rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-expire-general-considerations.html) to make objects expire after 30 days of creation. Not sure if there someone will to host those resources though. Or if there is a cheaper alternative."

We could do that in a free repo, so that eliminates hosting cost concerns."

This is intentional and an important security measure as we are executing un-trusted, potentially malicious code. Running the code in docker as we do is a mitigation but I would still argue against changing this. There are solutions, I will test them on my fork and report back/open a PR."
