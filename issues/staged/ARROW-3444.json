Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs it says in the title, I think this would be a very handy attribute to have available in Python. You can get it by converting to pandas and using `DataFrame.nbytes` but this is wasteful of both time and memory so it would be good to have this information on the `pyarrow.Table` object itself.\r\n\r\nThis could be implemented using the [__sizeof__](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getsizeof) protocol",
