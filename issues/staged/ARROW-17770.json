Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was trying to figure out the thread-safeness of Gandiva projector evaluation, i.e., whether I can use a single Projector to evaluate multiple inputs concurrently. I assumed it isn't safe because the Evaluate function is not marked const. However, as far as I understand, the Evaluate function merely executes a compiled function on the input, which doesn't modify a project's internal states and should be const.",
