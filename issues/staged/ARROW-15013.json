Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `arrow::Concatenate()` is not exposed at the R level. I imagine the preferred way to deal with this from a user perspective is to use `ChunkedArray$create()` for this; however, from a developer perspective it's very difficult to replicate this functionality. For example, another package using the Arrow C API might want to use the arrow R package to concatenate record batches complex nested types instead of implementing it themselves.\r\n\r\nExample usage in C++: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/9cf4275a19c994879172e5d3b03ade9a96a10721/r/src/r_to_arrow.cpp#L1215",
