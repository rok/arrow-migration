Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe record batch builder takes a schema as input and uses that schema when creating the record batch.\r\n\r\nHowever when one or more fields are dictionaries, the data type is unknown until the dictionary builder flushes and the initial schema often does not match. The builder needs to modify the schema for the actual data type generated.\r\n\r\nThis problem is easily reproduced by providing a schema with a field dictionary(int16(), utf8()) and adding a single row. This yields a data type of dictionary(int8(),utf8()).",
