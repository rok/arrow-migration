Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe need to align the C# writer (and test the reader) for NullType. See\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5287>\u00a0and\u00a0ARROW-6379.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n>The C++ implementation has been writing 2\u00a0`Buffer`\u00a0Flatbuffer struct values with length 0 for NullType. Rather than having dummy/placeholder Buffer I think it is more consistent to write no metadata for this type.",
