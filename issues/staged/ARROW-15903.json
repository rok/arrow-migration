Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have the CUDA toolkit installed on my Ubuntu 20.04 machine. I can build Arrow with CUDA support fine using the system-provided clang. However, if I try the conda-forge clang, I get the following CMake error when configuring:\r\n```Java\n\r\n-- Unable to find cudart library.\r\nCMake Error at /home/antoine/miniconda3/envs/pyarrow/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:230 (message):\r\n  Could NOT find CUDAToolkit (missing: CUDA_CUDART) (found version\r\n  \"10.1.243\")\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  /home/antoine/miniconda3/envs/pyarrow/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:594 (_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE)\r\n  /home/antoine/miniconda3/envs/pyarrow/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindCUDAToolkit.cmake:814 (find_package_handle_standard_args)\r\n  src/arrow/gpu/CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package)\r\n\r\n```",
