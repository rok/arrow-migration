Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we build Arrow's cpp library using CMake, arrowTargets.cmake will be generated and installed but it's broken.\r\n\r\nThe following is a part of arrowTargets.cmake generated.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n# Create imported target arrow_shared\r\nadd_library(arrow_shared SHARED IMPORTED)\r\n\r\nset_target_properties(arrow_shared PROPERTIES\r\n  INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES \"dl;pthreadshared\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Create imported target arrow_static\r\nadd_library(arrow_static STATIC IMPORTED)\r\n\r\nset_target_properties(arrow_static PROPERTIES\r\n  INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES \"glog_static;zstd_static;zlib_shared;snappy_static;lz4_static;brotli_dec_static;brotli_enc_static;brotli_common_static;double-conversion_static;boost_system_shared;boost_filesystem_shared;boost_regex_shared;jemalloc_static;rt;pthreadshared\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are no INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and linker doesn't recognize pthreadshared because the true name of pthread should be libpthread.so or libpthread.a.\r\n\\*_static and \\*_shared are also wrong name.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, apps which links arrow can't be built using CMake.",
