        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5471](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5471). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI used the test case in\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/tests/test_gandiva.py#L25>, and found an issue when I was using the slice operator\u00a0`input_batch[1:]`. It seems that the offset is ignored in the Gandiva projector.\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.gandiva as gandiva\r\n\r\nbuilder = gandiva.TreeExprBuilder()\r\n\r\nfield_a = pa.field('a', pa.int32())\r\nfield_b = pa.field('b', pa.int32())\r\n\r\nschema = pa.schema([field_a, field_b])\r\n\r\nfield_result = pa.field('res', pa.int32())\r\n\r\nnode_a = builder.make_field(field_a)\r\nnode_b = builder.make_field(field_b)\r\n\r\ncondition = builder.make_function(\"greater_than\", [node_a, node_b],\r\npa.bool_())\r\nif_node = builder.make_if(condition, node_a, node_b, pa.int32())\r\n\r\nexpr = builder.make_expression(if_node, field_result)\r\n\r\nprojector = gandiva.make_projector(\r\nschema, [expr], pa.default_memory_pool())\r\n\r\na = pa.array([10, 12, -20, 5], type=pa.int32())\r\nb = pa.array([5, 15, 15, 17], type=pa.int32())\r\ne = pa.array([10, 15, 15, 17], type=pa.int32())\r\ninput_batch = pa.RecordBatch.from_arrays([a, b], names=['a', 'b'])\r\n\r\nr, = projector.evaluate(input_batch[1:])\r\nprint(r)\r\n```\r\nIf we use the full record batch\u00a0`input_batch`, the expected output is\u00a0`[10, 15, 15, 17]`. So if we use\u00a0`input_batch[1:]`, the expected output should be\u00a0`[15, 15, 17]`, however this script returned\u00a0`[10, 15, 15]`. It seems that the projector ignores the offset and always reads from 0.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA corresponding issue is created in GitHub as well\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/4420>",
