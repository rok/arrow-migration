I didn't notice it.\r\nCould you confirm there are all needed jars in the assets at https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/releases/tag/nightly-2021-05-26-0-github-java-jars ?\r\nIt seems that we need to upload not only binary(?) `.jar` but also `.pom`, `javadoc.jar`, `sources.jar` and `tests.jar`.\r\nSee also: https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.apache.arrow%20AND%20v:4.0.0 \r\nThe arrow-java-root package has `source-release.zip`. What is this?"

It is not uploading the other ones you mentioned, like the tests jars. We need to change the last step of the process to upload the ones you mentioned too.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks for the links!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAbout the **zip** file you mentioned, I need to check what is this.
