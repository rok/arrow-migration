        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18182](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18182). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have AWS Lambdas that were updated to run with PyArrow 9.\u00a0 We were calling the pyarrow.parquet.read_table function with the columns parameter to specify which columns to read.\u00a0 With PyArrow version prior to 9 this worked fine with just 500MB of memory for the Lambda.\u00a0 With PyArrow 9 we started to get these exceptions:\r\n\r\nAWS Error [code 99]: curlCode: 28, Timeout was reached\r\n\r\nWe did some experimenting and found two options to get around the issue.\r\n\r\nOption 1:\u00a0 Increase the memory to 1.7 MB so the Lamba gets a full CPU for the container\r\nOption 2:\u00a0 Continue to allocate just 500 MB of memory, but stop using the columns parameter.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLooking for some insight as to what the issue might be.\u00a0 Thanks.",
