Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discovered in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10890, it's currently possible for a kernel to declare an output type and actually return another one.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to add debug-mode check in the kernel or function execution machinery to validate the concrete output type returned by the kernel exec function.",
