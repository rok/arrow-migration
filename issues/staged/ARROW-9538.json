Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`pyarrow.filesystem.resolve_filesystem_and_path` should support a `where` that is a S3 URL like:\r\n```java\n\r\ns3://bucket/folder/file.ext\n```\r\nIt seems like all the pieces are there but was never developed. If given some light guidance I may be able to add the code in a PR.\r\n\r\nThanks and LMK if this is a crazy request!",

However, we should see to fix this in `pyarrow.fs` (which has an S3FileSystem), and not the legacy `pyarrow.filesystem`, though.\r\n\r\n"
