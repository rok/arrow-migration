Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen you try and run a query such as\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nselect AVG(ts_colum) from t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere ts_column has `DataType::Timestamp` type, you get a pretty unintelligible error message\r\n\r\n\"Coercion from [Timestamp(Nanosecond, None)] to the signature Uniform(1, [Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, Float32, Float64]) failed.\"\r\n\r\nThis error should be improved to say something more like \"AVG is not supported for {datatype} try an explicit cast.\"\r\n",
