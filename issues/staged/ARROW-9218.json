Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf I create a snappy-compressed parquet file from a DataFrame in spark or pandas, and then import this same file into R using:\r\n```java\n\r\narrow::read_parquet(the_file, as_data_frame=TRUE)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```java\n\r\narrow::read_parquet(the_file, as_data_frame=FALSE)\n```\r\nThen the columns that were numeric/float before will load as strings.\r\n\r\nLoading the same file in Python through\r\n```java\n\r\npd.read_parquet(the_file)\r\n```\r\nWill correctly interpret numeric columns as numeric.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nInteger columns seem to be read as integers however.",

Otherwise works correctly."
