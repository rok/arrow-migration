Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current implementation of `Filter` on RecordBatch, Table does redundant analysis of the filter array. It would be more efficient in most cases (i.e. whenever there are multiple columns) to convert the boolean array into a selection vector and then use `Take`",
