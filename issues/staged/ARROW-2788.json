        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2788](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2788). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should define what the semantics of Plasma's Delete operation is, especially in the presence of errors (object in use is deleted, non-existing object is deleted).\r\n\r\nMy current take on this is the following:\r\n\r\nDelete should be a hint to the store to delete, so if the object is not present, it should be a no-op. If an object that is in use is deleted, the store should delete it as soon as the reference count goes to zero (it would also be ok, but less desirable in my opinion, to not delete it).\r\n\r\nI think this is a good application of the \"Defining errors away\" from John Ousterhouts book (A Philosophy of Software Design).\r\n\r\nPlease comment in this thread if you have different opinions so we can discuss!",

When the Delete function is used to delete a single object, it is OK give some message when the object is in undesirable status. However, when we delete a list of objects, there are too many status combinations. It is hard to give out a proper status hint. \r\n\r\nWe can implement a cache to store the objects to-be-deleted which are in use and clean the object later when it is released."
