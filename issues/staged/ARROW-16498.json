        "title": "[C++] Fix potential deadlock in arrow::compute::TaskScheduler",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16498](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16498). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAn extremely simplified version of the task scheduler's ScheduleMore method it looks something like:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nvoid ScheduleMore(int num_to_schedule) {\r\n  tasks_that_need_running_.fetch_add(num_to_schedule);\r\n  if (!weak_lock.lock()) {\r\n    // If someone else is scheduling then return early\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  auto tasks = PickTasks();\r\n  weak_lock.unlock();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is possible for one thread to have the lock, and find 0 tasks.  But then, before it gives up the lock, another thread adds tasks and fails to acquire the lock.  Neither thread will schedule anything even though there are tasks to run.  This can lead to deadlock.\r\n\r\nThe proposed PR changes the logic to (still extremely simplified):\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nvoid ScheduleMore(int num_to_schedule) {\r\n  tasks_that_need_running_.fetch_add(num_to_schedule);\r\n  tasks_added_recently.store(true);\r\n  if (!weak_lock.lock()) {\r\n    // If someone else is scheduling then return early\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  auto tasks = PickTasks();\r\n  if (tasks_added_recently.compare_exchange_strong(true, false)) {\r\n    if (tasks.empty()) {\r\n      ScheduleMore();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  weak_lock.unlock();\r\n}\r\n```",
