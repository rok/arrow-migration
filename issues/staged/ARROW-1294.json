I can't repro this locally with cmake 3.9.0 , it might make sense to investigate directly at Appveyor machine with happened crash via rdp session"

In general, it seems that in cmake 3.9.0 was implemented manually generated by cmake some kind of test Visual Studio project file to get info about installed VS tools. But possibly some incompatibility causes MSBuild failures time to time."
