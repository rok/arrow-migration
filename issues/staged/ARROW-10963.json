        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10963](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10963). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAn implementation of `PartialEq` for `ScalarUDF` and `AggregateUDF` was added in ARROW-10808 ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8836)), which was a requirement for the `PartialEq` derivation for `Expr`.\r\n\r\nThe implementation checks equality on only the UDFs' `name` and `signature` fields: the underlying assumption is two UDFs with the same name and signature must be the same UDF. This assumption may hold up in a SQL context where UDFs are registered by name (therefore guaranteeing they are distinct), however, it doesn't hold up in a general case where there are no uniqueness requirements on the name. \r\n\r\nImprove the equality implementation for `ScalarUDF` and `AggregateUDF`. For additional context, see the discussion in the pull request [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8836#discussion_r536874229). \r\n",
