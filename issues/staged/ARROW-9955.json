Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs suggested by `[~jhorstmann]` on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8142#discussion_r485468664\r\n\r\n> I'd be interested in a benchmark of the to_string function or the kernel, maybe one for the happy case with `T` and `Z` and one for the last fallback. From my experience with Java, [parsing timestamps can be rather slow](https://github.com/jhorstmann/packedtime#benchmarks) and it might be worth writing a specialized implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
