        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15142](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15142). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen trying to save a Pandas dataframe with a nested type (list within list, list within dict) using pyarrow engine, the following error is encountered\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#e75c58\">ArrowInvalid</font>: ('cannot mix list and non-list, non-null values', 'Conversion failed for column A with type object')\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nx = pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [[24, 27, [1, 1]]]})\r\nx.to_parquet('/tmp/a.pqt', engine=\"pyarrow\")\u00a0 \n```\r\nDoing a bit of googling, it appears that this is a known Arrow shortcoming. However, this is a commonly encountered datastructure, and 'fastparquet' handles this seamlessly. Is there a proposed timeline/plan for fixing this?",
