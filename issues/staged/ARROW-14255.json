        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14255). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAccording to the documentation ( https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.FlightClient.html#pyarrow.flight.FlightClient.do_action ) I would expect to be able to invoke `client.do_action` and get back an iterator. While it seems that the function is in fact a generator itself.\r\n\r\nThis makes a big difference because if it returns an iterator I expect to be able to do `client.do_action(...)` and just ignore the result if I don't care. But if it's a generator ignoring the results makes so that it actually doesn't get invoked at all and thus that the server won't do anything.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense to make `do_action` return a generator instead of being a generator itself, that would keep backward compatibility and would avoid puzzled users that don't see their code being invoked when they do `client.do_action(...)`",
