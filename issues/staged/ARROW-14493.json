        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14493](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14493). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile ARROW-8621 enabled the proper tagging for Go releases, major version releases need to update the import path to ensure proper handling. As a result, if we're going to properly version the Go Arrow and Parquet libraries, in addition to adding the tags, we need to have major version upgrades also update the module name and import to have `/v<major version>` tacked onto the end. \r\n\r\nthis also means updating ALL of the source files to use the new path whenever there's a major version update.
