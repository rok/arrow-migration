        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12310). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the `ValueVector#getObject` API supports covariance for primitive types.\r\nFor example, `IntVector#getObject` returns `Integer` while `BitVector#getObject` returns `Boolean`.\r\n\r\nFor complex types, we should also support covariance. For example, `ListVector#getObject` should return a `List`\r\n\r\nThis will help reduce unnecessary casts, and enforce type safety. ",
