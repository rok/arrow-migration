Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are already adding prefixes manually in the filenames (example: https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/src/arrow/ipc). This can be a bit awkward at times. It may be useful to have an option like `PREFIX \"ipc-\"` or `PREFIX \"plasma-\"` to make the unit tests related to a project component easier to identify",
