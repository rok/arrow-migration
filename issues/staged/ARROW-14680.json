Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen round-tripping over the C data interface, the validation of the NullArray requests 1 buffer. However, [the specification requires none](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#null-layout).\r\n\r\nThis also happens when creating a NullArray - the below errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pyarrow\r\n\r\npyarrow.NullArray.from_buffers(pyarrow.null(), 10, [])\r\n> ValueError: Type's expected number of buffers (1) did not match the passed number (0).\r\n```\r\n",
