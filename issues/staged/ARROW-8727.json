Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI ran into this issue while working on refactoring kernels. `StringConverter<T>` must be initialized to be able to support parametric types like Timestamp, but this produces an awkwardness and possibly a performance penalty (I haven't measured yet) in inlined functions. \r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm refactoring everything to be static non-stateful",
