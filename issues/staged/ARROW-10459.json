        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10459](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10459). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n**Summary**\r\nInstalling pyarrow on aarch64 via pip using command \"pip3 install pyarrow\" tries to build wheel from source code\r\n\r\n**Problem description**\r\npyarrow doesn't have wheel for aarch64 on PyPI repository. So, while installing pyarrow via pip on aarch64, pip builds wheel for same resulting in it takes more time to install pyarrow. Making wheel available for aarch64 will benefit aarch64 users by minimizing pyarrow installation time.\r\n\r\n**Expected Output**\r\nPip should be able to download pyarrow wheel from PyPI repository rather than building it from source code.\r\n\r\n@pyarrow-team, please let me know if I can help you building wheel/uploading to PyPI repository. I am curious to make pyarrow wheel available for aarch64. It will be a great opportunity for me to work with you.",
