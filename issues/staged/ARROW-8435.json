Thank for linking them together. By the way, what a small world, I hope you're doing well!\u00a0"

You are trying to subscript an object which you think is a list or dict, but actually is None. This means that you tried to do:\r\n \r\nNone[something]\r\n\r\nThis error means that you attempted to index an object that doesn't have that functionality. You might have noticed that the method sort() that only modify the list have no return value printed \u2013 they return the default None. 'NoneType' object is not [subscriptable](http://net-informations.com/python/err/nonetype.htm) is the one thrown by python when you use the square bracket notation object[key] where an object doesn't define the __getitem__ method . This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
