It leads to boilerplate code.\r\n\u00a0\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\ndt = pa.array([b\"foo\", b\"bar\", b\"baz\", b\"bar\", b\"baz\", b\"bar\"], type=pa.binary())\r\ndictionary = dt.dictionary_encode()\r\nprint(dictionary.type)\r\n# dictionary<values=binary, indices=int32, ordered=0>\r\npc.cast(dictionary, pa.dictionary(index_type=pa.int8(), value_type=pa.binary()), safe=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowNotImplementedError: Unsupported cast from dictionary<values=binary, indices=int32, ordered=0> to dictionary using function cast_dictionary\r\n```\r\n",
