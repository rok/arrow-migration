        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18328](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18328). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOnce everything has converted over to the non-async-generators scanner then there should be a fair amount of legacy code that can be safely removed (this is internal code so no need to worry about deprecation cycles).  This JIRA mainly exists as a placeholder to mark in comments places that should be cleaned up.",
