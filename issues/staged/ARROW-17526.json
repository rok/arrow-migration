Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://twitter.com/jonkeane/status/1560016227824721920?s=20&t=g2MhdOOJbh0q0MpxPI4R_Q\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote this, I wished there was a one-page I could show passing a table or recordbatchreader back and forth. https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/r/using-pyarrow-from-r.html#introduction-4 also has some details, but is more focused on scalars and arrays than tables.
