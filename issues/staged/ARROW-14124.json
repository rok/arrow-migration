        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14124](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14124). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe error is: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/3696604088#step:7:15209\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n Timezone not present, cannot convert to string with timezone: %Y-%m-%d%z\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, I think I\u2019ve got close to the source of the issue (though let me tell you neither the source nor the docs for R are accurate [1] on this\u2026)\r\n\r\n3.4 (and earlier):\r\n```r\n\r\n> attributes(c(lubridate::ymd_hms(\"2018-10-07 19:04:05\", tz = \"Etc/GMT+6\"), NA)) \r\n$class\r\n[1] \"POSIXct\" \"POSIXt\" \r\n```\r\n\r\n3.5 (and later):\r\n```r\n\r\n> attributes(c(lubridate::ymd_hms(\"2018-10-07 19:04:05\", tz = \"Etc/GMT+6\"), NA)) \r\n$class\r\n[1] \"POSIXct\" \"POSIXt\" \r\n\r\n$tzone\r\n[1] \"Etc/GMT+6\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo R itself is dropping the `tzone` attribute when we use `c()`, that is being passed to Arrow as such, and then when Arrow goes to print a timezone it (rightfully!) complains that there is no timezone to be formatted into the string. \r\n\r\nThis behavior actually sounds right (given the inputs), so I propose that we catch the error R <=3.4 (or skip the test in r<=3.4)\r\n\r\n[1] - The documented behavior is current, but it didn't change at the same time as the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nThe docs starting in 4.1.0 state:\r\n Using \\code{\\link{c}} on \\code{\"POSIXlt\"} objects converts them to the\r\n  current time zone, and on \\code{\"POSIXct\"} objects drops any\r\n  \\code{\"tzone\"} attributes, unless they are all marked with the same\r\n  time zone.\r\nhttps://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/tags/R-4-1-0/src/library/base/man/DateTimeClasses.Rd#L180-L183\r\n\r\nThe docs before that state:\r\n  Using \\code{\\link{c}} on \\code{\"POSIXlt\"} objects converts them to the\r\n  current time zone, and on \\code{\"POSIXct\"} objects drops any\r\n  \\code{\"tzone\"} attributes (even if they are all marked with the same\r\n  time zone).\r\nhttps://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/tags/R-4-0-5/src/library/base/man/DateTimeClasses.Rd\r\n",
