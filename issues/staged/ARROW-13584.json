        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13584](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13584). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUsing Typescript 4.3.5 I am seeing compilation issues in .ts files with the compiler option `skipLibCheck` enabled, but the module is working fine (Node.js 14.16.0)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt's common for library .d.ts files to have incompatibility with the current compilation either due to missing peer-types or compiler incompatibility. I think both are happening here, but it doesn't matter for the consuming code as long as the JS is compatible (which it is) - in these cases `skipLibCheck` silences the .d.ts issues.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn this package that solution does not actually silence the compiler errors because .ts files are shipped right alongside the .js and .d.ts files.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have attached an example tsconfig.json and a log of the compiler errors I see.",
