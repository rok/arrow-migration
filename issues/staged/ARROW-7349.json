Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nstd::lower_bound returns the end of the search range, when failing to find a match. \r\n\r\nThe end of the search range is one position after the last valid position. So the value in this position is undefined, and we should not reference the value here to compare it with the target value. ",
