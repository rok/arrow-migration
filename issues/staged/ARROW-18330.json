        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18330](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18330). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowing up on this stack overflow question: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74430949/table-from-nested-list-struct>\r\n\r\nWould it be worth introducing a Table.from_struct_array function?\r\n\r\nI'm actually not 100% sure it is needed or if it make sense.\r\n\r\nFor example, I'm not sure how it should behave when receiving a ChunkedArray (of type StructType) vs receiving a StructArray. In which case it's behaviour feels a bit overloaded and maybe it belongs to the `compute` package.\r\n\r\nAlso it's already possible to do such a thing (as illustrated in the SO question). Maybe it's more a problem of documentation. An example like this could be added to the cookbook.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
