Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the ArrowStreamReader must be constructed with a channel/stream to read data from.  It would be better to use an abstraction that would decouple a specific input stream from the incoming messages.  This is following the discussion from https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/839",
