Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7546#issuecomment-651177576. \r\n\r\nThe row group information in Parquet's FileMetadata includes a \"total_byte_size\" field. It would be useful to expose this information on the RowGroupInfo object, similarly as we already expose \"num_rows\".\r\n\r\ncc `[~rjzamora]`",
