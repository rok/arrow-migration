Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf I run a query like the following:\r\n```java\n\r\nSELECT MIN(fare_amount), MAX(fare_amount) FROM tripdata\n```\r\nI see this logical plan:\r\n```java\n\r\nLogical plan: Aggregate: groupBy=[[]], aggr=[[MIN(#10), MAX(#10)]]\r\n\u00a0 TableScan: tripdata projection=None\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis means that every column is being loaded into arrays rather than just the two columns that I care about, resulting in terrible performance.",
