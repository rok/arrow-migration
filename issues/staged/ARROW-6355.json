Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAccording to the discussion in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4993#discussion_r316009165,>\u00a0we often encountered this scenario: we compare values repeatedly. The comparisons differs only in the parameters (vector to compare, start index, etc).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to the current API, we have to create a new RangeEqualVisitor object each time the comparison is performed. This leads to non-trivial performance overhead.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, we make the\u00a0RangeEqualVisitor reusable, and allow the client to change parameters of an existing visitor.\u00a0",
