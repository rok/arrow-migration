Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe don't currently test if our release binary installation catches the correct version / works / has all of the features. Same for RSPM installed packages. \r\n\r\nCould/should we add these to a nightly job (either an existing one like the devdocs, or create a new one) to ensure that everything has deployed ok? It could also be a crossbow job that doesn't run nightly, but we trigger manually after a release.",
