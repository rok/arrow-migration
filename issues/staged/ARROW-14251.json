        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14251](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14251). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, our array counting sort assumes the indices are trivially ascending on input (as generated by `std::iota`). This prevents it from being used in `ConcreteRecordBatchColumnSorter`.\r\n\r\nAllowing counting sort to be used there may improve performance, though that must be measured.",
