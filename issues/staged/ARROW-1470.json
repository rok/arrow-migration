Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are some situations (`arrow::ipc::SerializeRecordBatch` where we pass a `MemoryPool*` solely to call `AllocateBuffer` using it. This is not as flexible as it could be, since there are situation where we may wish to allocate from shared memory instead. \n\nSo instead:\n\n```Java\nFunc(..., BufferAllocator* allocator, ...) {\n  ...\n  std::shared_ptr<Buffer> buffer;\n  RETURN_NOT_OK(allocator->Allocate(nbytes, &buffer));\n  ...\n}\n```",
