Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf an Array is created with null_count == -1 but without any null (and thus no null bitmap buffer), then ArrayData.null_count will remain -1 when exporting if null_count is never computed. The exported C struct also has null_count == -1 [1]. But when importing, if null_count != 0, an error\u00a0[2]\u00a0will be raised.\r\n\r\n[1]\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/5389008df0267ba8d57edb7d6bb6ec0bfa10ff9a/cpp/src/arrow/c/bridge.cc#L560\r\n\r\n[2]\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/5389008df0267ba8d57edb7d6bb6ec0bfa10ff9a/cpp/src/arrow/c/bridge.cc#L1404\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
