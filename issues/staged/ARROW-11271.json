        "title": "[Rust] [Parquet] List schema to Arrow parser misinterpreting child nullability",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11271](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11271). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently do not propagate child nullability correctly when reading parquet files from Spark 3.0.1 (parquet-mr 1.10.1).\r\n\r\nFor example, the below taken from <https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md>\u00a0is currently interpreted incorrectly:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n// List<String> (list nullable, elements non-null) \r\noptional group my_list (LIST) {\r\n    repeated group list { \r\n        required binary element (UTF8); \r\n    } \r\n}\n```\r\nThe Arrow type should be:\r\n```java\n\r\nField::new(\r\n    \"my_list\",\r\n    DataType::List(\r\n        box Field::new(\"element\", DataType::Utf8, nullable: false),\r\n    ),\r\n    nullable: true\r\n)\n```\r\nbut we currently end up with\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nField::new(\r\n   \"my_list\",\r\n   DataType::List(\r\n       box Field::new(\"list\", DataType::Utf8, nullable: true),\r\n   ),\r\n   nullable: true\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't seem to be an issue with the master branch as of opening this issue, so it might not be severe enough to try force into the 3.0.0 release.\r\n\r\nI tested null and non-null Spark files, and was able to read them correctly. This becomes an issue with nested lists, which I'm working on.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
