        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5327](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5327). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter calling Finish it may become necessary to append further elements to an array, which we don't currently support. One way to support this would be consuming the array to produce a builder with the array's elements pre-inserted.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nstd::shared_ptr<Array> array = get_array();\r\nstd::unique_ptr<ArrayBuilder> builder;\r\nRETURN_NOT_OK(MakeBuilder(std::move(*array), &builder));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will be efficient if we cannibalize the array's buffers and child data when constructing the builder, which will require that the consumed array is uniquely owned.",
