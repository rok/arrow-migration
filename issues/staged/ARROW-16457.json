        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16457](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16457). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-10675 added support for AWS S3 Web identity credentials on the C++ side. We should bind that functionality on the Python side.\r\n\r\nTo avoid proliferation of authentication arguments to the `S3FileSystem` constructor, some of which mutually exclusive (but not all), we should probably add instead a more flexible `auth` argument that could represent to different authentication kinds.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of API design necessary. IMHO it's probably best if the `auth` argument is a dedicated `S3Auth` object with several constructors, but perhaps we can instead admit some kind of dict?\r\n",
