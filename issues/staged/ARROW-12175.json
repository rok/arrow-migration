        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12175](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12175). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello,\r\n\r\nI just updated a small utility that converts binary data to Parquet from Arrow 0.15 to 3.0, and noticed that CMake could not resolve `find_package(Parquet REQUIRED)`, as my installation tree of Arrow contained `\u2026/share/cmake/arrow/ParquetConfig.cmake`, but CMake seems to be expecting `\u2026/share/cmake/*parquet*/ParquetConfig.cmake.`\r\n\r\nCreating a symbolic link from the `arrow` directory to a `parquet` directory solved CMake's find procedure. Alternatively, I ended up at this work-around that did not require me modifying my local install tree:\r\n```java\n\r\nfind_package(Arrow REQUIRED)\r\nget_filename_component(MY_SEARCH_DIR ${Arrow_CONFIG} DIRECTORY)\r\nfind_package(Parquet REQUIRED HINTS ${MY_SEARCH_DIR})\r\n```\r\nIs this expected behavior? I went through the CMake code and found that there is only one installation directory for all CMake files: `ARROW_CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR` \u2014 I would expect this to be specific to the libraries exported.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatthias",
