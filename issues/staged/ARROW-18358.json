        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18358](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18358). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to make the transition between using the different CSV reading functions as smoothly as possible we could introduce a version of open_dataset specifically for reading CSVs with a signature more closely matching that of read_csv_arrow - this would just pass the arguments through to open_dataset (in the ellipses), but would make it simpler to have a docs page showing these options explicitly and thus be clearer for users.\r\n",
