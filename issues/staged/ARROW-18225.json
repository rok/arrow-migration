Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using `write_metadata`, `kwargs` can be used to pass a FileSystem to a ParquetWriter. However, those `kwargs` are not passed to `read_metadata`\u00a0later on despite the function accepting a filesystem argument.\r\n\r\nThis creates an error when trying to write metadata on a S3FileSystem for example.\r\n```python\n\r\ndef write_metadata(schema, where, metadata_collector=None, **kwargs):\r\n    writer = ParquetWriter(where, schema, **kwargs)\r\n    writer.close()\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if metadata_collector is not None:\r\n        metadata = read_metadata(where) # kwargs should be passed here\r\n        for m in metadata_collector:\r\n            metadata.append_row_groups(m)\r\n        metadata.write_metadata_file(where) # kwargs should be passed here\r\n```\r\n```python\n\r\ndef read_metadata(where, memory_map=False, decryption_properties=None,\r\n                  filesystem=None):\r\n    ...\n```",
