Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, users can still specify `use_legacy_dataset=True` explicitly to get the old implementation/behaviour. But if we want to remove that implementation at some point (ARROW-15868), we should start deprecating that option, to futher nudge people to the new implementation.",
