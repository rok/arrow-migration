Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHey there :)\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n \\* Open VSR\r\n \\* Do something that'll change the `Field` of one of the vectors in the VSR (promotable writer, etc)\r\n \\* `vsr.syncSchema()`\r\n \\* Open JsonFileWriter, `start`, `write` -> NPE\r\n\r\nLooks like the cause is that the `fieldVectorsMap` cache isn't updated in `syncSchema`? Possibly a few other places - `addVector`/`removeVector` too?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJames",
