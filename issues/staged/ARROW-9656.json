Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\r\nWhen I make a typo in the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE command, I get an error message that doesn't doesn't tell me the valid values of STORED AS:\r\n\r\nAs a user, I would like the software to guide me to the correct resolution and tell me what the supported formats are.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```Java\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE repro\r\nSTORED AS ARROW\r\nLOCATION 'repro.arrow';\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n> CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE repro\r\nSTORED AS ARROW\r\nLOCATION 'repro.arrow';\r\n\r\nParserError(ParserError(\"Expected fileformat, found: ARROW\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally the error should say that the valid choices are PARQUET, CSV, or DSJSON\r\n",
