Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow that ARROW-222 is merged, we can hook these together, and theoretically read and write to HDFS (or any other random access blob store). There's quite a bit of plumbing to do to make this work both in C++ and Python",

I just started on this so just an FYI `[~xhochy]`"
