Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi all, thanks for the useful library!\r\n\r\nI noticed when calling `pyarrow.dataset.parquet_dataset`\r\n that the order of the files (`dataset.files`) does not match that which is stored in\u00a0`_metadata` via the `metadata.row_group\\(i).column\\(0).file_path`. I'm not an Arrow expert by any means, but is this intentional?\r\n\r\nI think the unordered map is the culprit, but I have not recompiled to test this theory. <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/133b1a904bf7fc1d24343c306a2279e27d4ebe6d/cpp/src/arrow/dataset/file_parquet.cc#L870>",
