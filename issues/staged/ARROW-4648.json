        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4648](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4648). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nEven after my eyes are used to the codebase, I still find the namings and/or code organization inconsistent.\r\n\r\n## File Formats\r\n\r\nSo arrow already support a couple of file formats, namely parquet, feather, json, csv, orc, but their placement in the codebase is quiet odd:\r\n- parquet: src/parquet\n- feather: src/arrow/ipc/feather\n- orc: src/arrow/adapters/orc\n- csv: src/arrow/csv\n- json: src/arrow/json\n  I might misunderstand the purpose of these sources, but I'd expect them to be organized under the same roof.\n  \n  ## Inter-Process-Communication vs. Flight\n  \n  I'd expect flight's functionality from the ipc names. \n  \n  Flight's placement is a bit odd too, because it has its own codename, it should be placed under cpp/src - like parquet, plasma, or gandiva.\n  \n",

This should probably be moved to src/arrow/datasets/parquet or similar, along with datasets/csv, datasets/json, datasets/orc, etc. As one caveat around this, the symbols in parquet/arrow are exported in libparquet.so, so while it is probably better for them all to end up in a libarrow_datasets.so or something, we will need to have some kind of transitional plan"
