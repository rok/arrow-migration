        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9554](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9554). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed that `FixedWidthInPlaceVectorSorter` in the `arrow-algorithms` library produces the wrong result. A simple test case is a `IntVector` with the following values:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71]\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe expected result of sorting is\r\n```java\n\r\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71]\n```\r\nWhat I actually observe is\r\n```java\n\r\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 35, 36, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71]\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have not yet determined whether any of the other sorters are also buggy.",

The bug was introduced when we tried to improve the algorithm for selecting the pivot. \r\n\r\nWe are sorry for bringing you the trouble. In the future, we will provide more test cases for the sorting functionality, and hope there will be no more such problems. "
