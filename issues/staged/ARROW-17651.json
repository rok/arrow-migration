Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRunning the python tests give a lot of the following warnings:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nopt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyarrow/tests/test_fs.py::test_s3fs_limited_permissions_create_bucket\r\n  /opt/conda/envs/arrow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyarrow/tests/util.py:439: ResourceWarning: unclosed file <_io.TextIOWrapper name=29 encoding='utf-8'>\r\n    _run_mc_command(mcdir, 'admin', 'policy', 'add',\r\n  Enable tracemalloc to get traceback where the object was allocated.\r\n  See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html#resource-warnings for more info.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally we should ensure the tests don't give such warnings (it also makes other warning we should notice less visible)",
