Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt is challenging to run the clang-format and cpplint checks on Windows out of the box, and it is not documented how to do so. I found that neither the `format` nor `lint` targets work correctly when building with Visual Studio 2015. We could use Docker, of course, but it would be nice to be able to run these tools natively on Windows",

We also need to be careful about how we invoke cpplint because Windows can't handle long commands (over 8191 characters, apparently)\r\n\r\nGiven that we have a list of cpplint exclusions in cpp/CMakeLists.txt already, and we are parallelizing cpplint with xargs, it would make sense to write a build-support/run_cpplint.py that takes an exclusions file, path to the cpplint script or executable, and parallelism options"
