Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThese are the aggregating versions of string concatenation\u2014they combine values from a set of rows into a single value.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe bindings for `paste()` and `str_c()` might be tricky to implement because when these functions are called with the `coallapse` argument unset, they do _not_ aggregate.\r\n\r\nIn `summarise()` we need to be able to use scalar concatenation within aggregate concatenation, like this:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nstarwars %>%\r\n  filter(!is.na(hair_color) & !is.na(eye_color)) %>% \r\n  group_by(homeworld) %>% \r\n  summarise(hair_and_eyes = paste0(paste0(hair_color, \"-haired and \", eye_color, \"-eyed\"), collapse = \", \"))\n```",
