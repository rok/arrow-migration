I'm seeing this locally and in the manylinux1 docker container, neither of them use `-m 'not parquet'`.",

That is clearly unacceptable. Now you have to opt in to the unit tests. Would you like them to always run if `import pyarrow.parquet` works? I imagine this can be accomplished with suitable code in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/tests/conftest.py"
