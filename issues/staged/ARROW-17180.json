Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs brought up on the mailing list: https://lists.apache.org/thread/hscjqyw7lpt95vlkzoslm6pyhy9x6wso\r\n\r\nWhen we resume producing in the source node, we should run the continuation (which starts scanning again) as a new task.  This will avoid potential stack overflow (if we pause and start many times) and help make for more understandable stack traces.  The continuation is unlikely to have anything to do with the task that is calling resume and so there is not as much downside to a context switch.",
