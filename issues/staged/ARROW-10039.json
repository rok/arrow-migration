Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, all buffers in rust are created aligned. We also panic when a buffer is not aligned. However, [the spec](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#buffer-alignment-and-padding) only recommends, but do not require, memory alignment.\r\n\r\nThis issue aims at following the spec more closely, by removing the requirement (not panicking) when memory passed to a buffer is not aligned.",
