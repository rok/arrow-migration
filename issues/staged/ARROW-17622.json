        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17622](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17622). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nConsidering the existing sink nodes and newly introduced Fetch node with sort capability, we will only need two nodes, \"sort\", and \"fetch\" in the long run. Because once the ordered execution is integrated, some features could be removed. Right now, there are three nodes doing somewhat closely related things which is redundant work assuming unordered execution. Namely they are, \"order_by_sink\", \"fetch_sink\", and \"select_k_sink\". So one of them will need to go away at some point and all of them will no longer be sink nodes and sorting behavior will need to be removed from \"fetch\".\r\n\r\nThe task breakdown needs to be determined. Better to keep a few sub-tasks.\u00a0",
