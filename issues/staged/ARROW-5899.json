Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe windows nightly wheel builds are failing: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Ursa-Labs/crossbow/builds/25688922 probably caused by 88fcb09, but it's hard to tell because of the error message \"ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.\" is not very descriptive.\r\n\r\nTheoretically it shouldn't affect the 0.14 release because 88fcb09 was added afterwards.",
