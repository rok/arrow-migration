Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems we cannot send a dataset (table) object opened with `open_dataset()` into `write_parquet()` or `write_csv_arrow()`.\u00a0 I realize that the former is a 'multi-file' representation and the latter two are not, but as both represent a single table (single schema) it seems like this should still work.\u00a0 (It also looks like write_csv_arrow() gives us more control over formatting details than write_dataset() )",
