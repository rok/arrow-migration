        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2144](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2144). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we repeat dictionary lookups every time we bind a new record batch when doing an equality check in a DataFrame op (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/js/src/predicate.ts#L143).\r\n\r\nIn most cases the dictionary won't be changing between record batches, so we should remember these reverse dictionary lookups, either permanently, or at least for the duration of the current operation.",
