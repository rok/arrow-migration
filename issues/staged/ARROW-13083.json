Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWanted to install nightly wheels for a rust integration test when I noticed that the nightly wheels get produced with base version 3.0.0.\r\nThis is due to the recently changed release workflow. Now we're creating tags from release branches without a post rebase step, so setuptools_scm fails to find the correct version number on diverged branches.",

We would need to first create a commit on master, then create the release branch from the preceding commit for the first RC. For every subsequent RCs we would need to cherry-pick commits (potentially required patches) from master and regenerate the changelog again to the release branch, then merge that changelog back to the master :)\r\n\r\nIt's more logical to me as well to tag the version bump commit, though the in-between commits will have wrong versions generated (which we could live with IMO). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
