        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15822](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15822). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nEdit (Dragos Moldovan-Gr\u00fcnfeld): The issue I opened (ARROW-15833) is basically a duplicate of this. It's fundamentally a C++ issue that happened to surface in the R CSV writer. I hope you don't mind, I modified the components to C++\r\n\r\n===================\r\nConsider this reprex:\r\n```java\n\r\narrow::write_csv_arrow(data.frame(time = as.difftime(1, units=\"secs\")), \"test.csv\")\n```\r\nThis errors with:\r\n\r\nError: NotImplemented: Unsupported cast from duration[s] to utf8 using function cast_string\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote that readr::write_csv() has no trouble with this (which renders the data as \"1\" without a unit).\u00a0 Arguably the readr rendering is lossy, but then we usually assume units are provided in other metadata anyway.",
