        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8264](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8264). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt is too difficult to write examples that print record batches and it would be good to have a utility method to print a batch or to get rows from a batch as a Vec<String>. We already have code in the CSV writer that could be repurposed.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to modify the csv writer to be able to print to a string rather than a file.",
