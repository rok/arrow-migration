Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when passing a list of file path to FileSystemDatasetFactory, the files that have one of their parent directories with a underscore or dot are skipped. Since the file paths were passed as an explicit list, we should maybe not skip them.\r\n\r\nFor example, when specifying a directory (Selector), it will only check child directories to skip, not parent directories.",
