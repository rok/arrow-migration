        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14203](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14203). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[The comment for the **length** data member of ExecBatch](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/exec.h#L202-L211) states that it will always have a value of 1 for Scalar types. This is misleading/incorrect because for aggregate kernels you could have an ExecBatch formed by projecting just the partition columns from a batch, in which case you'd have scalar rows with a length > 1.",
