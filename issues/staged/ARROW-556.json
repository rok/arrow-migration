Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstructions to run integration tests say to specify the cpp build path and then export an env var ARROW_CPP_TESTER relative to that build path.  The problem is 2 other vars, STREAM_TO_FILE and FILE_TO_STREAM also rely on the build path which is made from ARROW_HOME and 'cpp/test-build/debug' and will fail if that is not the build path used.",
