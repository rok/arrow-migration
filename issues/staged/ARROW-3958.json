Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we ship file descriptors of objects from the store to the client every time an object is created or gotten. There is relatively few distinct file descriptors, so caching them can get rid of one IPC in the majority of cases.",
