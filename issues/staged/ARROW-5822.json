        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5822](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5822). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe flight package provides IntegrationTestClient and IntegrationTestServer as sample implementations for client/server side. \r\n\r\nIn these implementations, the client sends the content of some json file to the server. However, it is not clear what the format of the json file should be like.\r\n\r\nSo it is desirable to also provide a sample json file, which makes it easier to run the flight program. ",
