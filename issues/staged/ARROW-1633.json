I'd like to understand the use cases a bit better"

So at some point in the future we can use the Cpp standard library for converting things to UTF8 but that day is not today\n- Python 2.7 has UTF32 codecs we can use for converting from UTF32 to UTF8 https://docs.python.org/2.7/c-api/unicode.html#utf-32-codecs. \n- Python 3.6 seems to have the same UTF32 API https://docs.python.org/3.6/c-api/unicode.html#utf-32-codecs\n\nWe aren't supporting ASCII/fixed size binary types from NumPy yet, so we should probably handle these at the same time. We can use the (slow) Python C APIs for now to get UTF8 and maybe replace these with something natively C/Cpp if someone cares enough about perf to do the work"
