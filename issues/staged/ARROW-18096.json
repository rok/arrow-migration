Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently use the top post comment body of a github PR as the body of the commit message. It is not uncommon to tag someone when opening a PR, but retaining those github usernames in the commit message is annoying as that can generate additional notifications for the people that were tagged.\r\n\r\nIt should be straightforward to remove the github user names from the message body (for example, just remove the @, so it doesn't work anymore as user name link)",
