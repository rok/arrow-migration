Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGROUP BY expressions are ignored unless the query also contains an aggregate expression.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce you can execute the following query on the\u00a0aggregate_test_100 data set.\r\n```java\n\r\nSELECT c2 FROM aggregate_test_100 GROUP BY c2\n```\r\n**Expected:**\r\n\r\n`1`\r\n `2`\r\n `3`\r\n `4`\r\n `5`\r\n\r\n**Actual:**\r\n\r\n`2`\r\n `5`\r\n `...98 more rows...`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe order of the expected isn't necessarily correct since the query doesn't contain an ORDER BY expression.",
