Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have accumulated a lot of artifacts in https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/arrow. This is not scalable. I'm going to remove the old RC's for now, but this should be part of post-release scripts or release manager duties",
