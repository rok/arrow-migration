Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/bae33d622421e6377ab3e9c81dd054c796ab48a3/java/vector/src/main/codegen/templates/MapWriters.java#L174 as discussed on the mailing list\n\nThe choice to treat field names as case insensitive is application-dependent, so this logic should probably be pushed downstream into Apache Drill. In the C++ library (and Python wrapper), we are handling `std::string` names as is without modification. ",
