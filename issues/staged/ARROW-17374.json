SageMaker provides Jupyter-like notebooks, with each instance running Amazon Linux 2 as its OS, itself based on RHEL.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTrying to install a few ways, e.g., using the standard binaries, using the nightly builds, setting ARROW_WITH_SNAPPY to ON and LIBARROW_MINIMAL all still result in the following error.\u00a0\r\n```\n\r\nx86_64-conda-linux-gnu-c++ -std=gnu++11 -shared -L/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/R/lib/R/lib -Wl,-O2 -Wl,--sort-common -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -Wl,--disable-new-dtags -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--allow-shlib-undefined -Wl,-rpath,/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/R/lib -Wl,-rpath-link,/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/R/lib -L/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/R/lib -o arrow.so RTasks.o altrep.o array.o array_to_vector.o arraydata.o arrowExports.o bridge.o buffer.o chunkedarray.o compression.o compute-exec.o compute.o config.o csv.o dataset.o datatype.o expression.o extension-impl.o feather.o field.o filesystem.o imports.o io.o json.o memorypool.o message.o parquet.o r_to_arrow.o recordbatch.o recordbatchreader.o recordbatchwriter.o safe-call-into-r-impl.o scalar.o schema.o symbols.o table.o threadpool.o type_infer.o -L/tmp/Rtmpuh87oc/R.INSTALL67114493a3de/arrow/libarrow/arrow-9.0.0.20220809/lib -larrow_dataset -lparquet -larrow -larrow_bundled_dependencies -lz SNAPPY_LIB-NOTFOUND /home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/R/lib/libbz2.so -pthread -larrow -larrow_bundled_dependencies -larrow_dataset -lparquet -lssl -lcrypto -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto -lcurl -L/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/R/lib/R/lib -lR\r\nx86_64-conda-linux-gnu-c++: error: SNAPPY_LIB-NOTFOUND: No such file or directory\r\nmake: *** [/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/R/lib/R/share/make/shlib.mk:10: arrow.so] Error 1\n```\r\nSnappy is installed on the systems, and both shared object (.so) and cmake files are there, where I've tried setting the system env variables Snappy_DIR and Snappy_LIB to point at them, but to no avail.",
