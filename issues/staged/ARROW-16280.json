        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16280](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16280). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSplit off from ARROW-16161, since this is a fairly straightforward fix and completely independent of ExecBatch.\r\n\r\nExpression::type() currently copies a shared_ptr<DataType>, while the return value is often used directly. We can avoid copying the shared_ptr, by returning a reference to it. This reduces thread contention on these shared_ptrs (ARROW-16161).",
