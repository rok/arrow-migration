        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13770](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13770). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be nice if the R bindings included some support for\u00a0[MapType](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/20885df121266a8519692c7630c98beb570f3b47/cpp/src/arrow/type.cc#L424)\u00a0and [MapArray](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/71a57b156a077de29a879fd5627e366684c140ac/cpp/src/arrow/array/array_nested.cc#L283). For example, when a _named_\u00a0R vector is converted to an Arrow Array, it would become a MapArray \u00a0instead of a ListArray, with the names as the keys and the values as the items.",
