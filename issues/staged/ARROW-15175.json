Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMinimal test case: all buffers of size 1 currently hash to the same value (-1684229222)\r\n\r\nTo my (admittedly untrained) eye, it looks like <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/c9588c54a1264ce02abc70cd02486966a1e97acf/java/memory/memory-core/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/memory/util/hash/MurmurHasher.java#L99> should range from `length - 1` rather than `index - 1`?\r\n\r\nAlso, should the nearby `index += 1` be removed, so that `i` and `index` don't meet in the middle? (`index` is being checked in the loop condition)",
