Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA FileSystemDataset currently requires a full listing of files it contains on construction, so a scan cannot start until all files in the dataset are discovered. Instead it would be ideal if a large dataset could be constructed with a lazy file listing so that scans can start immediately.",
