Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDepends on ARROW-21. There's many cases to implement here (e.g. 3 kinds of Parquet list encoding that all map onto the single Arrow list type) so I may create follow-up JIRAs for some of the less-commonly-occurring Parquet schemas.",
