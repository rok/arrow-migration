The explanation is as following: even if you duly export template classes such as `NumericBuilder<Int32Type>`, they will be compiled independently in several places, so the resulting typeids will be different. This makes `dynamic_cast` attempts fail when they do not use the same typeid for the template class.\r\n"

Perhaps this project is not worth the trouble, at least not for now. "
