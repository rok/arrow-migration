The below your suggested code works well for primitive types.   \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I enable `-DARROW_PARQUET=ON` in cmake, non-primitive types (parquet::FixedLenByteArray, parquet::ByteArray, and parquet::Int96) are passed as T. In this case, this line `current_value_ = static_cast<uint64_t>(value)` causes the cast error.   \r\nIMHO, these cases use 32 as bit_width_ (just my guess, I did not confirm it). Am I correct?\r\n\r\nWhile I tried to create a patch by using std::enable_if or constexpr, I was not successful to create it. Are there any advices to handle these three cases?\r\n\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n    T value = T();\r\n    bool result =\r\n        bit_reader_.GetAligned<T>(static_cast<int>(BitUtil::CeilDiv(bit_width_, 8)), &value);\r\n    current_value_ = static_cast<uint64_t>(value);\r\n```"

I'm not sure about Int96.\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, unfortunately, it occurs at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/encoding.cc#L2530-L2559. They read to call the constructor of `RleDecoder` at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/encoding.cc#L1484. Then, `T` is passed to `NextCounts()` thru `GetBatchWithDictSpaced()` at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/encoding.cc#L1502\r\n\r\nWhile Int96 is depreciated, test cases are there. Of course, I can make it low-priority."
