Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n1. 'types.py' didn't export `_as_type`, causing failures in certain cython/python combinations. I am surprised to see that the CI didn't fail.\r\n2. After updating the gandiva cpp part (ARROW-3587), the cython bindings (ARROW-3602) are not consistent.",
