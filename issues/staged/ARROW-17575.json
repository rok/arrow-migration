So this change is preferred.\r\nFYI: Users can still use `arrow_shared` with CMake 3.18 or later for backward compatibility.\r\nSee also: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/ArrowConfig.cmake.in#L110-L121>\r\n\r\nBTW, we have a Jira issue to update this document: ARROW-17575\r\nIf you take over this, I'm very happy!\r\n\r\nHere are some notes for the new our CMake packages:\r\n \\* Users can use `{}find_package(Arrow){`}, `find_package(Parquet)` and so on as usual but can't use `COMPONENTS` like `find_package(Arrow COMPONENTS parquet)`\r\n \\*\\* The old our CMake packages just ignore `{}COMPONENTS{`}.\r\n \\* `Arrow::arrow_shared` is recommended than `arrow_shared`\r\n \\* `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` not `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` should be used to find Apache Arrow C++ that isn't installed to the system location such as `/usr`\r\n \\*\\* The old our CMake packages also uses `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` (`{}.pc{`} can be used to find the `Arrow` CMake package)"
