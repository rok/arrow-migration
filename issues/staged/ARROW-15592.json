Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA Substrait plan consists of multiple relations.  Some (only one?) of those relations can be \"root\" relations which means they name the output fields.  We currently do not support this.  It should be a straightforward projection to assign the field names.",
