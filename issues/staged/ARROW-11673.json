For plain integers it behaves like this:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [6]: pa.array([1, 1000], \"int64\").cast(\"int8\")\r\n...\r\nArrowInvalid: Integer value 1000 not in range: -128 to 127\r\n\r\nIn [7]: pa.array([1, 1000], \"int64\").cast(\"int8\", safe=False)\r\nOut[7]: \r\n<pyarrow.lib.Int8Array object at 0x7f42ecdc69a0>\r\n[\r\n  1,\r\n  -24\r\n]\r\n```"
