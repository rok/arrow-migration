        "title": "[JavaScript] Wrong array type for countBy",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5274](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5274). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe\u00a0`countBy`\u00a0function is not returning correct histograms, as it seems to select the wrong array type for the indexing.\r\n\r\nThe following line in countBy seems to be causing the problems:\r\n\r\n`const countByteLength = Math.ceil(Math.log(vector.dictionary.length) / Math.log(256));`\r\n\r\nFor example, if the dictionary length is 3, yet the indices length is 1 million, the result of this expression will be 1, which will lead to a Uint8Array being used, again resulting in overflows.\r\n\r\nCodepen example\r\n <https://codepen.io/Yngve92/pen/mYdWrr>\r\n\r\nIf I switch the expression to:\u00a0`const countByteLength = Math.ceil(Math.log(vector.length) / Math.log(256));`\u00a0it seems to be working all right, but I am not sure if this is correct.\r\n\r\nThe expression is on L63, L189 in src/compute/dataframe.ts.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPR submitted:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4265>\u00a0",
