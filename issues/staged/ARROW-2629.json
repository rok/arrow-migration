Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis was discovered when running the Ray integration tests. In\u00a0send_notifications we are modifying\u00a0pending_notifications_, which invalidates the iterator in the for each loop in push_notification.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy to reproduce, so I don't have a regression test unfortunately, but I'll post a patch that fixes it.",
