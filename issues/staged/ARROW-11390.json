Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is more of a turbodbc issue I think, but perhaps someone here would have some idea of what changed to cause potential issues.\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ncursor = connection.cursor()\r\ncursor.execute(\"select top 10 * from dbo.tickets\")\r\ntable = cursor.fetchallarrow()\n```\r\nI am able to run table.num_rows and it will print out 10.\r\n\r\nIf I run table.to_pandas() or table.schema or try to write the table to a dataset, my kernel dies with no explanation. I reverted back to pyarrow 2.0 and the same code works again.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/blue-yonder/turbodbc/issues/289>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

That is the most reliable way. When you install `turbodbc` with `pip` it is built and then the build is cached on your system. If you change your `pyarrow`, you need to uninstall `turbodbc`, delete the caches and build it from source again, conda on the other side takes care of all that.\r\n\r\n`turbodbc` has not yet been rebuilt on conda-forge for the new Arrow version, probably will be available in 3-4h, just wait until then before doing new tests."
