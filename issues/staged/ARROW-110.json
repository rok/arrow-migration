Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is some evidence that powers of 2 might not be optimal (the facebook folly library suggests this in there explanation of why they have there own vector type).  They use 1.5 (as do other implementations that don't use two).",
