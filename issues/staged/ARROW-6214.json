Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we run the examples of the R package through the sanitizers, several errors show up. These could be related to the segfaults we saw on the macos builder on CRAN.\r\n\r\nWe use the docker container provided by Winston Chang to test this: https://github.com/wch/r-debug\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce + example outputs at: https://gist.github.com/jeroen/111901c351a4089a9effa90691a1dd81\r\n",

Some of these look pretty bad, it is unclear to me if the originate in libarrow or in the R bindings. There are also warnings from RDthreadcheck:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nFatal error: Wrong thread calling 'Rf_protect'\r\nFatal error: Wrong thread calling 'RunFinalizers'\r\nFatal error: Wrong thread calling 'RunFinalizers'\r\nsegfault\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's very likely that these problems are related to the crashes in the unit tests on the CRAN mac builder."

This would entail to remove all functions with Builder in the signature.  Only the Init and Ingest calls are required, Init could only take the type."
