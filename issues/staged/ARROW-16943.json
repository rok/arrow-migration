Maybe it is a problem inside the environment where the job is running.",

MacOS github runners are currently extremely scarce, to alleviate that we added a powerful intel mac (16 cores 32GB). After testing it with different workflows we added the tags \"macos-latest\" and \"macos-11\" so we don't need to add new tags (and make the wfs run on self-hosted only, which would than be a bottle neck again). We also added a cleanup step that removes changes to brew and the working dir. As the maven repo is in ~ this was unaffected but we can add that to the cleanup step of the runner. "
