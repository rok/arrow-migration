        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16130](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16130). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe class [`ParquetFileWriteOptions`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFileFormat.html#pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFileFormat.make_write_options), returned by [`ParquetFileFormat.make_write_options`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFileFormat.html#pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFileFormat.make_write_options) is not documented in the API docs, unlike `{}ParquetReadOptions{`}. Most of the associated options are documented in [`pyarrow.parquet.write_table`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.parquet.write_table.html#pyarrow.parquet.write_table) already, so they should be easy to write up.\r\n\r\nFor reference, we encountered this when trying to expose these options in [the delta-rs writer](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs/pull/581).
