Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo calculate standard deviation of an array or chunked array.\r\n\r\nI would prefer two pass algorithm [1] as a balance of numerical stability and performance. Numpy uses this method to calculate variance [2].\r\nWelford's online algorithm [3] is more stable, but also more expensive in computation.\r\n\r\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Two-pass_algorithm\r\n[2] https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/92ebe1e9a6aeb47a881a1226b08218175776f9ea/numpy/core/_methods.py#L176\r\n[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Welford's_online_algorithm",
