        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10910](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10910). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n### Code Sample (copy-pasteable)\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\npq.read_table(None)\r\n```\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe above snippet will produce a Segmentation Fault, which is highly undesirable. The reason I discovered this, was I had a function that was supposed to return a file path, but on my first iteration I forgot to return. Thus, when I ran my module with\r\n```python\n\r\npq.read_table(generate_fp())\n```\r\nit produced a Segmentation Fault.\r\n### Expected Output\u00a0\r\n\r\nIdeally this will raise an **ValueError**, indicating to the user that **None** is an invalid source/file path. In my opinion, this is much more desirable than a violent segfault.",

We should indeed avoid such segfaults. Note that with the latest version of pyarrow, by default you already get a nice error:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [16]: pq.read_table(None)\r\n....\r\nTypeError: Expected a path-like, list of path-likes or a list of Datasets instead of the given type: NoneType\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut you can still get the same segfault when using the legacy dataset implementation with `pq.read_table(None, use_legacy_dataset=True)`"

And in general adding a test for what segfaulted before is still good to add as well, to prevent it happens again in the future. "
