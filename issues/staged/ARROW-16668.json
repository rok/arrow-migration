Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are not building wheels with substrait as seen on these builds:\r\n<https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/6588182160?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:572>\r\n\r\nWe should add it to the nightlies and default wheels. From my understanding it should be enough to add it here: <font color=\"#e01e5a\">ci/scripts/python_wheel_manylinux_build.sh</font>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
