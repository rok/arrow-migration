        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13870](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13870). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have numerous test skips for 32bit windows + multithreading. Should we add something to `onLoad` that detects this and proactively sets arrow to single-threaded (using `set_cpu_count()` and / or `options(arrow.use_threads)`?). \r\n\r\nShould we display a message that we did this and if someone wants to live experimentally they can increase that again?",

I think the issue is that we don't know why it's not working and we haven't been able in the past to find out why. And at this point I don't know how much effort it is worth spending trying to solve it, given that this toolchain is no longer required on CRAN. I'm content to degrade gracefully on older Windows machines."
