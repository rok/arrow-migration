        "title": "[CI] Make Travis CI resilient against hash sum mismatch errors",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4785](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4785). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTravis Jobs sometime fail with a GPG error:\r\n```java\n\r\nW: http://ppa.launchpad.net/couchdb/stable/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg: Signature by key 15866BAFD9BCC4F3C1E0DFC7D69548E1C17EAB57 uses weak digest algorithm (SHA1)\r\nW: An error occurred during the signature verification. The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used. GPG error: https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/ubuntu trusty InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 6B05F25D762E3157\r\nW: Failed to fetch https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease  The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 6B05F25D762E3157\r\nE: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz  Hash Sum mismatch\r\nW: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\r\nThe command \"if [ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME == \"linux\" ]; then\r\n    sudo bash -c \"echo -e 'Acquire::Retries 10; Acquire::http::Timeout \\\"20\\\";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99-travis-retry\"\r\n    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\r\n    sudo apt-get update -qq\r\n  fi\r\n  \" failed and exited with 100 during .\r\nYour build has been stopped.\n```\r\nIt would be nice if the number of retries, timeout, or both could be increased to make the travis jobs more resilient to this seemingly sporadic issue.",
