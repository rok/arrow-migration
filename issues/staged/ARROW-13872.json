Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using an ExtensionTypeVector with a RangeEqualsVector to compare with another extension type vector, it fails because in vector.accept() the extension type defers to the underlyingVector, but this is not done for the vector initially set in the RangeEqualsVisitor, so it ends up either failing due to different types or attempting to cast the extension vector to the underlying vector type.",
