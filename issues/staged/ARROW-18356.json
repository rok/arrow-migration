        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18356](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18356). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, if the argument `as_data_frame` is passed into `open_dataset()` with a CSV format dataset, the error message returned is:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nError: The following option is supported in \"read_delim_arrow\" functions but not yet supported here: \"as_data_frame\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, we could silently ignore it if as_data_frame is set to `FALSE` and give a more helpful error if set to `TRUE` (i.e. direct user to call `as.data.frame()` or `collect()`).\r\n\r\nReasoning: it'd be great to get to a point where users can just swap their `read_csv_arrow()` syntax for `open_dataset()` and get helpful results.",
