        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9631](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9631). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that the dependencies are inverted. The core arrow crate should contain the array data structures and compute kernels and should not depend on the flight crate, which contains protocols and brings in many dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf we have code for converting between arrow types and flight types then that code should live in the flight crate.",
