Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-11699 adds support for dplyr::across inside a mutate(). The .fns argument does not yet support purrr-style lambda functions (e.g. `~round(.x, digits = -1)` but should be added. \r\n\r\nAs well as this, we should check the new ways in which these functions can be specified (n.b. using `\\x`) as we might want to support both while the older way isn't fully deprecated yet.",
