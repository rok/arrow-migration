Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13620 added a binding for `n_distinct()` but it only works for\u00a0_grouped_\u00a0aggregation, not whole-table aggregation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n```java\n\r\nTable$create(starwars) %>%\r\n  group_by(homeworld) %>%\r\n  summarise(n_distinct(species)) %>%\r\n  collect()\n```\r\nbut this errors:\r\n```java\n\r\nTable$create(starwars) %>%\r\n  summarise(n_distinct(species)) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n\r\n#> Error: Key error: No function registered with name: count_distinct\n```\r\nOnce we have a non-hash `count_distinct` aggregate kernel in the C++ library (ARROW-14035) we should bind the options for it in the R package and add a test.",
