Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, the C# ArrowBuffer implementation is immutable. The only way to build it is through the provided builders. It also ought to be able to wrap external memory as a zero copy op. The C++ implementation exposes this as a GetMutableValue() method. Example use cases are similar to when a NumPy array is wrapped in an ArrowBuffer in pyArrow.",
