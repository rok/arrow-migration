        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9870](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9870). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Filesystem methods don't provide a human-friendly interface for basic operations like ls, mkdir, etc. Since we provide access to S3 and potentially other cloud storage, it would be nice to have simple methods for exploring it.\r\n\r\nAdditional ideas:\r\n\r\n- S3Bucket class/constructor: it's basically a SubTreeFileSystem containing S3FS and a path, except that we can auto-detect a bucket's region.\n- Add a class like the FileLocator C++ struct list(fs, path). _also_ kinda like a SubTreeFileSystem, but with different methods and intents. Aside from use in ls/mkdir/cp, it could be used in file reader/writers instead of having an extra `filesystem` argument added everywhere, e.g. `fs$path(\"path/to/file\")`.
