        "title": "[C++/Python] Add support for S3 Bucket Versioning",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17544](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17544). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow offers a reasonably capable S3 interface, but it lacks support for S3 Buckets that have versioning enabled.\u00a0 For information about what S3 bucket versioning is, see:\r\n\r\n<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html>\r\n\r\nIf Arrow is interacting with a bucket where versioning is enabled, there can be S3 keys that have multiple versions of content stored utilizing the same key name.\u00a0 At the present moment, Arrow does not have the ability to:\r\n1. Access versions of an S3 key rather than just the latest version of an S3 key.\u00a0 There is no ability to specify the VersionId parameter of S3's GetObject API.\n1. Report the VersionId created when a new S3 key is uploaded to a bucket.\n   \n   Along with S3, GCS also supports versioned buckets.\n   \n   <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning>\n   \n   There are a few shortcomings of the Filesystem interface to support remote file systems that support versioning:\n   \n   1. The parameters for open_input_stream() and open_input_file() do not easily lend themselves to adding an additional parameter of \"version\" because they would be passed to all other implemented filesystems.\u00a0 Most other file systems that exist don't actually support versioning.\n   \n   2. Upon completion of an S3 multipart upload (i.e., close() on an S3FileSystem output stream), there is not currently a way for the user to determine the VersionId or ETag of the S3 key that was created.\u00a0 This is important to know because if there are multiple concurrent writers to S3, it should be possible to identify the written S3 key.\n   \n   Proposed solutions to enable S3 Bucket versioning:\n   \n   1. To allow library callers to read specific versions of an S3 key, extend only the S3FileSystem interface with two new API calls:\n   \n   `open_input_stream_with_version()`\n   \n   `open_input_file_with_version()`\n   \n   Both are like their namesakes from the normal FileSystem interface but take an additional parameter of a \"version,\" which is a string representation of the VersionId returned by S3 when the S3 Key is created.\u00a0 If these functions are called with an empty string for the specified version, the latest version of the S3 key will be returned.\n   \n   I'm a bit reluctant to create these specialized functions just on the S3FileSystem interface, but I also don't think it is appropriate to change open_input_stream() and open_input_file()'s parameter list for all filesystems just for functionality that is only implemented by a small number of filesystems.\n   \n   2. Allow callers to call ReadMetadata() on an S3FileSystem output stream to retrieve the metadata about the S3 key that has been written after the stream has been closed.\u00a0 The metadata will likely include both a VersionId and a value for ETag.",

One possibility would be to add the version as an additional optional argument (e.g. \r\n`const util::optional<std::string>version& =  {}`).\r\n\r\n2) GCS has both generation and metageneration, I'm not sure how to handle that nicely in the API.

Should we just ignore the metageneration here?\r\n\r\nI think you should ignore it for now, yes.  metageneration changes when the metadata of an object changes, e.g., when you add new labels, or when you change the `contentType` attribute.  And FYI, if object versioning is enabled, then each version has a different metadata and metageneration.\r\n\r\n> 1) I'm lukewarm about adding new method definitions, ... (e.g. `const util::optional<std::string>version& = {}`).\r\n\r\nIt is not my place to design your API, just ignore me if this idea does not work for you. I would go further.  You can expect additional optional parameters, e.g., GCS supports conditional operations (\"read this object if its current generation is N\" or \"write this object if its current generation is M\"), I believe S3 supports those too.  If the objects are encrypted with customer-supplied encryption keys you need to provide them as part of each call.  Some application want to override the retry and backoff policies for some operations.\r\n\r\nThis suggests you need something like a `std::map<..., std::any>> options = {}` as the extra parameter.  This may serve as inspiration:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp/blob/2b1e12f31ec49e55419f5740c406b707e08ca5e1/google/cloud/options.h#L89\r\n"

I agree a general way to pass filesystem-specific options would be good.\r\n\r\nWe could use `std::any` (after we move to C++17) or we could perhaps have a base class `InputStreamOptions` that each filesystem might derive. Or we could have a `std::variant`, with the advantage that people won't pass arbitrary types by mistake.\r\n\r\n`[~bkietz]` What is your opinion on `std::any`?\r\n"

S3 keys can be any set of Unicode characters < 1024 bytes, so I'm not sure it is valid to treat them as URIs where a ? character denotes the start of the query fields.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html\r\n\r\nIt is important to be able to pass the VersionId or other request conditional information via the Python Dataset API; I'd like to be sure we're designing with that in mind."

Paths and URIs are clearly distinct concepts, though unfortunately users often mix them up.\r\n\r\nAs for putting the version in `FileInfo`, that depends: does listing a pseudo-\"directory\" in S3 and GCS also gives each object's version? If so, then I agree it could go in `FileInfo` (note `FileInfo`'s primary purpose is to list directory contents)."
