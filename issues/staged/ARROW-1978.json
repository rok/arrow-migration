Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere can be a fine line between what is an open source project and what is a company and what is a product or organization, so to keep things simple I have consolidated things into a single list without passing any judgments. I have also added a link to the Powered By page that is visible without digging into any menus on the front page",
