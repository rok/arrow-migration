        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13619](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13619). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `ARROW_USER_SIMD_LEVEL` environment variable allows to override the SIMD optimization level at runtime. For example `ARROW_USER_SIMD_LEVEL=NONE` is useful to benchmark a non-SIMD path.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems the hash aggregation code doesn't react to this. Hence, on an AVX2-enabled machine (which is really the majority of high-end x86 computers), it's cumbersome to run benchmarks for these code paths.",
