        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13133](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13133). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe R binding for the wday date accessor added in this PR <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10507> currently doesn't support returning the string representation of the day of the week (e.g. \"Mon\") and only supports the numeric representation (e.g. 1).\r\n\r\nWe should implement this, though discussion should be had about whether this belongs at the R or C++ level.",
