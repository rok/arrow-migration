Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe documentation page is mostly empty ( https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/compute.html ) but the API reference instead is fairly complete ( https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/compute.html ) it would be a good idea to add a bit more context and maybe directly recap the compute functions into to doc page",
