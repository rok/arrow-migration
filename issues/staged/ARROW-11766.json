        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11766](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11766). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCould this be the source of [errors like](https://github.com/arrow-interviewing/interview-question-1-Mauricio-Vargas-Sepulveda/pull/1/files#diff-c95526be36be633299f767ecc0377b7617d787f628a9e3a9163455e8520b7b9cR8) `Error: NotImplemented: Support for codec 'lz4' not built` after installing from CRAN?\r\n\r\n\r\nA few more details:\r\n\r\nThe default behavior (when neither `LIBARROW_BINARY=true` nor `NOT_CRAN=true`) is to build the arrow c++ libraries from source. And the default for building from source does not include all of the optional features and compression libraries (unless one sets `LIBARROW_MINIMAL=false`). \r\n\r\nCould we improve the error messaging that suggest either setting the right environment variable to install binaries (and then reinstall) or setting `LIBARROW_MINIMAL=false` (and then reinstall), possibly with a link to https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html to help people see other possible ways to resolve the installation issue.",
