        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17634](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17634). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that in version 9.0.0 `import pyarrow.fs` reserves 1+ (close to 2) gigs of virtual memory, this was not present in 8.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTest code:\r\n```python\n\r\ndef memory_snapshot(label=''):\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0from util.System import System\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0rss = System.process_rss_gigabytes()\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0vms = _max = System.process_gigabytes()\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0_max = System.process_max_gigabytes()\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0print(\"Memory snapshot (%s); rss=%.1f vms=%.1f max=%.1f GB\" % (label, rss, vms, _max))\r\n\r\nmemory_snapshot()\r\nimport pyarrow\r\nprint(pyarrow.__version__)\r\nmemory_snapshot()\r\nimport pyarrow.fs\r\nmemory_snapshot()\r\n```\r\n\r\n8.0.0 output\r\n```Java\n\r\nMemory snapshot (); rss=0.1 vms=0.4 max=0.4 GB\r\n8.0.0\r\nMemory snapshot (); rss=0.1 vms=0.5 max=0.6 GB\r\nMemory snapshot (); rss=0.1 vms=0.5 max=0.6 GB\r\n```\r\n9.0.0 output\r\n```Java\n\r\nMemory snapshot (); rss=0.1 vms=0.4 max=0.4 GB\r\n9.0.0\r\nMemory snapshot (); rss=0.1 vms=0.5 max=0.6 GB\r\nMemory snapshot (); rss=0.2 vms=2.2 max=2.3 GB\r\n```\r\n\r\ndigging further into what happens during import, it seems `initialize_s3` is what is the culprit.\r\n```Java\n\r\nbefore s3 initialize\r\nMemory snapshot (); rss=0.1 vms=0.5 max=0.6 GB\r\nafter s3 initialize\r\nMemory snapshot (); rss=0.2 vms=2.2 max=2.3 GB\r\n```\r\n",
