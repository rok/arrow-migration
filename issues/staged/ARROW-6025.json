Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've recently enabled gandiva in the conda c++ ursabot builders. The container doesn't contain the required timezones do the tests are failing:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n../src/gandiva/precompiled/time_test.cc:103: Failure\r\nExpected equality of these values:\r\n  castTIMESTAMP_utf8(context_ptr, \"2000-09-23 9:45:30.920 Canada/Pacific\", 37)\r\n    Which is: 0\r\n  969727530920\r\n../src/gandiva/precompiled/time_test.cc:105: Failure\r\nExpected equality of these values:\r\n  castTIMESTAMP_utf8(context_ptr, \"2012-02-28 23:30:59 Asia/Kolkata\", 32)\r\n    Which is: 0\r\n  1330452059000\r\n../src/gandiva/precompiled/time_test.cc:107: Failure\r\nExpected equality of these values:\r\n  castTIMESTAMP_utf8(context_ptr, \"1923-10-07 03:03:03 America/New_York\", 36)\r\n    Which is: 0\r\n  -1459094217000\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee build: https://ci.ursalabs.org/#/builders/66/builds/3046/steps/8/logs/stdio",

So far I count 3 different configurations for this build:\r\n\r\n- One for Travis CI\n- One in cpp/Dockerfile\\* for docker-compose\n- One for Buildbot on ursabot\n  \n  Can we discuss a plan on the mailing list for going from 3 different configurations to 1? This situation does not strike me as productive"

If not, I'll try and find a way to disable the tests in environments where the timezone related files are missing."

I believe we already hit this on windows too, and disabled the tests there."
