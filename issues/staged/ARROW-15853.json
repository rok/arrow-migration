        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15853](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15853). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```\n\r\nPython 3.10.0 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 20 2021, 02:25:18) [GCC 9.4.0] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> ndarr = np.array(range(10))\r\n>>> arr = pa.array(ndarr)\r\n>>> arr\r\n<pyarrow.lib.Int64Array object at 0x7efdf7974100>\r\n[\r\n  0,\r\n  1,\r\n  2,\r\n  3,\r\n  4,\r\n  5,\r\n  6,\r\n  7,\r\n  8,\r\n  9\r\n]\r\n>>> ndarr[0] = 10\r\n>>> arr\r\n<pyarrow.lib.Int64Array object at 0x7efdf7974100>\r\n[\r\n  10,\r\n  1,\r\n  2,\r\n  3,\r\n  4,\r\n  5,\r\n  6,\r\n  7,\r\n  8,\r\n  9\r\n]\r\n```\r\nWhile this behavior makes perfect sense with some consideration, it may surprise people. We should document which sources can be zero-copied, and note that in these cases, modifications to the underlying array will affect the PyArrow array (even though this is normally not the case).",
