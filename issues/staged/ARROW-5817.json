        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5817](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5817). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe approach used to determine whether or not Flight has been built will fail silently if the extension is built but there is an ImportError caused by linking or other issues \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/tests/test_flight.py#L35\r\n\r\nWe should use the same \"auto\" approach as other optional components (see https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/tests/conftest.py#L40) with the option for forced opt-in (so that ImportError does not cause silently skipping) so that `--flight` will force the tests to run if we expect them to work\r\n",
