        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13498](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13498). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis turned out to be my confusion in ARROW-13344: because the ScanNode takes a filter and projection, I wasn't creating a FilterNode because I assume that the filter is already applied--why else would I provide a filter to the ScanNode? But it turns out that if you don't Filter again, you get unfiltered results:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nTable$create(\r\n  group=c(1, 2), \r\n  value=c(5, 6)\r\n) %>% \r\n  filter(value > 5) %>% \r\n  group_by(group) %>% \r\n  summarize(sum(value)) %>% \r\n  collect()\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 2 x 2\r\n  group `sum(value)`\r\n  <dbl>        <dbl>\r\n1     1            5\r\n2     2            6\r\n```",

It does not remove all rows excluded by the filter- that is deferred to FilterNode.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, ScanNode does not perform projection- it ensures that fields referenced by the projection are loaded from disk (which for example in the case of parquet means you will pay less IO if you reference fewer fields)."
