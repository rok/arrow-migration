Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nScanner is not guaranteed to be scannable more than once (for example, a Scanner which wraps a RecordBatchReader cannot be rewound). However many c++ unit tests reuse scanners and there aren't clear comments explaining that scanners shouldn't be assumed reusable. The simplest solution is to explicitly require that all Scanners be single-use",

Are there other scanners that cannot be consumed more than once?"
