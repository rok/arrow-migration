Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the pyarrow.jvm module, when there is an empty array in Java, trying to create it in python raises a ValueError. This is because for an empty array, Java returns an empty list of buffers, then pyarrow.jvm attempts to create the array with pa.Array.from_buffers with an empty list.",
