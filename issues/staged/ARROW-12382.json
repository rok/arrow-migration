Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe don't bundle xsimd if the compile-time SIMD level is NONE, but we still try to build code that uses xsimd if the runtime SIMD level is not NONE. The bundle check needs to account for both. See\u00a0ARROW-11993.\u00a0",
