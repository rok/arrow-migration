Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed in\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8271>\r\n\r\nThat a string->list[string] kernel does not have the offsets preallocated in the output. I believe there is a preference for not doing allocations in kernels, so this can be optimized at a higher level. I think it can also be done in this case.\u00a0",

A scalar kernel always computes the output nulls by default, and there is no exception for list-returning scalar kernels."
