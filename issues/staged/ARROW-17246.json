        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17246](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17246). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBecause system jemalloc can't be used with `dlopen()`. If system jemalloc can't used with `dlopen()`, our shared libraried can't be loaded as bindings of script languages such as Ruby:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n+ ruby -r gi -e 'p GI.load('\\''Arrow'\\'')'\r\n(null)-WARNING **: Failed to load shared library 'libarrow-glib.so.900' referenced by the typelib: /lib64/libjemalloc.so.2: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused because system jemalloc isn't built with `--disable-initial-exec-tls`.
