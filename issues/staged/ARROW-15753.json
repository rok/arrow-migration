Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now the datasets JNI bridge uses some custom buffer passing which only seems to handle primitive arrays correctly (child array buffers and dictionaries are not considered):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/jni/dataset/jni_wrapper.cc#L498-L500\r\n\r\nInstead, it should use the C data interface, which is now implemented in Java.",
