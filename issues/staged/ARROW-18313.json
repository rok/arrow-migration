Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn using open_dataset, it creates a connection due to which the files in the directory get blocked and we cannot perform other operations on the file like replace!\r\n\r\nActual issue:\r\n1. We are running an atomic operation on a bunch of files, which replaces the temp file names to the target file names.\n1. But while this is happening, if we try to run open_dataset() on that particular directory, the atomic operation is failing and there are both target files and temp files in the directory.\n1. It is blocking the files that have been read through open_dataset().\n1. Please, provide me with more about how we can handle such problems.\n1.

(I don't see it in pyarrow or in other languages' API)\r\nDo you think it's possible to create a reproducible example script I could use to help with this?"

But I'll try to come back to this, or reference someone more familiar with the R API and if file handles are expected to be open there when using dataset."

ARROW-17208, ARROW-17002, ARROW-16421, ARROW-16452 are all basically this...and from reading those tickets it sounds like there may be an R-specific thing happening that is keeping those file handles from being closed as soon as possible."
