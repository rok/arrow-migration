        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6957](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6957).

So we could conditionally not install it if we're on CI.\n- The docker code around this changed in ARROW-6918 last week, around the time this started failing. The installation of this package was moved to a different part of the job, and it appears that `MAKEVARS=-j8` was added. Maybe that's causing more memory to be used concurrently? (Also, I would be shocked if CircleCI gave us a VM with 8 cores, so this seems wasteful and should probably be tuned to whatever the current system has.)\n  \n  cc `[~apitrou]` `[~fsaintjacques]`",

Perhaps we should make the MAKEVARS configurable or something, and use a lower number on Circle CI.\r\n\r\nIf R didn't have an entirely braindead build system, it would be able to choose the optimal number of cores by itself. I chose 8 because it worked well for my machine, but of course it won't be optimal for another machine...\r\n\r\nPerhaps a R expert can suggest a better way to choose the number of cores. You know those experts better than I do :)\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
