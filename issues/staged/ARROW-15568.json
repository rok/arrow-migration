Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTranslates the input string by replacing the characters present in the `from` string with the corresponding characters in the `to` string. This is similar to the `translate` function in [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/functions-string.html). If any of the parameters to this UDF are NULL, the result is NULL as well.",
