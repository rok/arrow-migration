        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10992](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10992). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCompiler support for Intel ICC/ICPC was added in\u00a0ARROW-10489\r\n\r\nHowever, there are still a few cases where\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n-march=<haswell|skylake-avx512>\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nis being added to C/CXXFLAGS. While this kinda-sorta works, for icc/icpc there is different set of optimization options (I use \" -xCORE-AVX2\" typically). The list of optimization options is quite verbose (well beyond what just the flags show) and this really needs the eyes of someone who is an expert on just what exactly happens to the generated code with the specific flags.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSpecific warnings:\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nicpc: command line warning #10121: overriding '-xCORE-AVX2' with '-march=skylake-avx512'\r\nicpc: command line warning #10121: overriding '-xCORE-AVX2' with '-march=skylake-avx512'\r\nicpc: command line warning #10006: ignoring unknown option '-mbmi2'\r\nicpc: command line warning #10121: overriding '-xCORE-AVX2' with '-march=haswell'\r\nicpc: command line warning #10121: overriding '-xCORE-AVX2' with '-march=haswell'\r\n    \r\n\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe haswell warning appears to come from the compilation of\u00a0cpp/src/arrow/util/bpacking_avx2.cc\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee: <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/performance-tools-for-software-developers-intel-compiler-options-for-sse-generation-and-processor-specific-optimizations.html>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
