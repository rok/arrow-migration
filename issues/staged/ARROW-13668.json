Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\npyarrow.csv.CsvWriter, pyarrow.ipc.RecordBatchFileWriter, and pyarrow.ipc.RecordBatchStreamWriter all have three writing methods, \"write\" (which accepts a table or a record batch), \"write_batch\", and \"write_table\".\r\n\r\npyarrow.parquet.ParquetWriter only has \"write_table\".  It should be trivial enough to add the other two methods and will help to have a consistent interface.",
