        "title": "[R] Reading large files randomly freezes",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15729](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15729). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi -\r\n\r\nI recently upgraded to Arrow 6.0.1 and am using it in R.\r\n\r\nWhenever reading a large file (~10gb) in Windows it randomly freezes sometimes. I can see the memory being allocated in the first 10-20 seconds, but then nothing happens and R just doesn't respond (the R process becomes idle too).\r\n\r\nI'm using the option options(arrow.use_threads=FALSE).\r\n\r\nI didn't have this issue with the previous version (0.15.1) I was using. And the file reads fine under Linux.\r\n\r\nI would post a reproducible example but it happens randomly. I even thought I would just read large files in pieces by first getting all the distinct sections of a specific column (with compute>collect) but that hangs too.\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Edit**\r\n\r\nNot sure if it makes sense to anyone but after a few tries it seems that the issue only happens in Rstudio. In the R console it loads it fine. All I'm executing is the below.\r\n\r\noptions(arrow.use_threads=FALSE)\r\naa <- arrow::read_arrow('.../file.arrow5')\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to point out that the underlying Rscript process under Rstudio seems to definitely use more than one core when executing the above.\r\n\r\n**Edit2**\r\n\r\nUsing arrow::set_cpu_count(1) seems to solve the issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
