I may take a little effort to cover the gap that exists right now.\r\n\r\n\u00a0As a newcomer to the project, I'm looking for ways to explore the codebase and I'd welcome the chance to take a stab at this, however being so unfamiliar\u00a0with the internals I may need to refer to the docs on one of the other lang's implementations. I may need to refer to the other implementations anyway just to keep the phrasing consistent. It could take some time.\r\n\r\nAny objections to me digging into this?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, would we prefer to set missing docs to warnings rather than errors now that CI will treat warnings as errors as of ARROW-2409?"
