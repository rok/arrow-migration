From <https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/1441>\u00a0the issue seems to be error-prone version 2.3.3 currently used is incompatible with java 13 that is being used in the nightly build. Updating it to 2.3.4 should fix this.",

Its failing for same reason for last two days. Do you have any idea why this is the case?\r\n\r\nThanks."

We can use another approach implemented in the crossbow script (basically an alternative for the deployment scripts on various CI services), see the usage here https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/conda-recipes/azure.osx.yml#L76-L91\r\n\r\nInstalling the dependencies on Travis could be more complicated than porting the CI template to Azure (travis.osx.yml to azure.osx.yml). \r\n"
