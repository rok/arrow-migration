Example here:\r\n```Java\n\r\n----------------------------- Captured stdout call -----------------------------\r\nCompiling pyarrow_cython_example.pyx because it changed.\r\n[1/1] Cythonizing pyarrow_cython_example.pyx\r\nrunning build_ext\r\nbuilding 'pyarrow_cython_example' extension\r\ncreating build\r\ncreating build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7\r\ngcc -fno-strict-aliasing -march=nocona -mtune=haswell -ftree-vectorize -fPIC -fstack-protector-strong -fno-plt -O3 -pipe -fdebug-prefix-map=${SRC_DIR}=/usr/local/src/conda/${PKG_NAME}-${PKG_VERSION} -fdebug-prefix-map=${PREFIX}=/usr/local/src/conda-prefix -DNDEBUG -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -I/home/travis/build/apache/arrow/pyarrow-test-2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include -I/home/travis/build/apache/arrow/python/pyarrow/include -I/home/travis/build/apache/arrow/pyarrow-test-2.7/include/python2.7 -c pyarrow_cython_example.cpp -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/pyarrow_cython_example.o -std=c++11\r\n----------------------------- Captured stderr call -----------------------------\r\ngcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-fno-plt'\r\nerror: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n(from https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/498722197)\r\n\r\nI'm afraid this looks like a conda-forge toolchain issue :-(\r\n",
