This is going to be useful for future query execution engine benchmarking.\r\n\r\nIt could also attract researchers.",

So far I have found two less-than-ideal bumps (though both should be able to be overcome):\r\n\r\n- Calling the dbgen function in DuckDB from R errors while preparing the statement.\n- I haven't seen a way to parallelize the generation (even with DuckDB's parallelization on)\n  \n  I'm actively looking into the first to get started on adding a few TPC-H benchmarks to arrowbench."
