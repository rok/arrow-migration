It looks like it crashes in gRPC (but the debugger can't get a backtrace anymore, and I can't build the bundled gRPC).\r\n\r\nI noticed that the last passing run installed mingw-w64-x86_64-grpc-1.35.0-**2**, while the failing runs install mingw-w64-x86_64-grpc-1.35.0-**3** - I wonder what changed there."
