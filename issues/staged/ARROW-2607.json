Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollow-up after\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2249: Currently only primitive arrays are supported in `pyarrow.Array.from_jvm` as it uses `pyarrow.Array.from_buffers` underneath. We should extend one of the two functions to be able to deal with string arrays. There is a currently failing unit test `test_jvm_string_array` in `pyarrow/tests/test_jvm.py` to verify the implementation.",

I would expect to be able to do the following:\r\n```java\n\r\nmy_string_array = pyarrow.Array.from_buffers(\r\n  pyarrow.string(),\r\n  row_count,\r\n  [\r\n    pyarrow.py_buffer(my_string_nullmask),\r\n    pyarrow.py_buffer(my_string_offsets),\r\n    pyarrow.py_buffer(my_string_bytes),\r\n  ],\r\n)\n```\r\nBut I get :\r\n> File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 578, in pyarrow.lib.Array.from_buffers\n> NotImplementedError: from_buffers is only supported for primitive arrays yet.\r\nI suppose if I wanted to contribute this fix, I should start looking at pyarrow/array.pxi first?"

For string/utf8 I think it should already work if you remove the exception and add some unit tests. Nested data will require a bit more work. I suggest also calling \"ValidateArray\" on the resulting array to guard against malformed output"
