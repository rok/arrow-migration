Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n> We don\u2019t do data page skipping at all in parquet-cpp. We should add this to the short list of holistic improvements to the datasets infrastructure \u2014 we support row group skipping using column chunk statistics, but that is very coarse grained. data pages are much more fine-grained:\r\n> https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/src/main/thrift/parquet.thrift#L516\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So just make sure that your test data has page statistics before you get too far."
