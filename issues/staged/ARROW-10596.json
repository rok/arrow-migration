Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe take benchmark has three issues:\r\n\r\n1. it is always taking the same element (indices is a constant vector), which is very easy to speculatively predict what the element is going to be.\r\n2. It also does not compare with vs without nulls\r\n3. all elements of the array are equal, which is again easy to speculatively predict",
