        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-491](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-491). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis would be very useful for interacting with Parquet and other data sources that use fixed-byte-width binary types, as a more efficient version of List<UInt8>. We can resolve adding this type to the format spec later.\n\n`[~julienledem]` `[~nongli]` do you have an opinion about this type? Would be equivalent to FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY in Parquet. It would be convenient to implement Decimal types on top of this",
