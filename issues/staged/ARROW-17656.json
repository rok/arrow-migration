Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment Acero Aggregates output contains aggregate fields followed by key fields. In Substrait this is the other way around. Also, it is not necessary to keep this static and use a project node to fulfill the requirement. It is rather important to modify this order and update the corresponding test cases.\u00a0",
