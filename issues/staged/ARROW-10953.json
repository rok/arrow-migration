Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis segfaults:\r\n```java\n\r\ntab <-\u00a0Table$create(data.frame(), schema = schema(a = int32()))\r\nas.data.frame(tab)\r\n```\r\nas does `tab$a`, i.e. just trying to extract the ChunkedArray.\r\n\r\n`Table$create(data.frame(b=1), schema = schema(a = int32()))` creates a Table with column named a, overwriting the \"b\" column name.\r\n\r\n`tab <- Table$create(data.frame(b=2, c=3), schema = schema(a = int32()))`, i.e. providing fewer fields in the schema than there are columns in the data, segfaults.\r\n\r\nThere should be some validation that the schema matches the data provided.",
