Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```python\n\r\n>>> arr = pa.array([[\"a\", \"b\"], None, [\"c\", \"d\"]], pa.list_(pa.string(), 2))\r\n>>> arr.validate(full=True)\r\n>>> arr.slice(0, 1).validate(full=True)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 1219, in pyarrow.lib.Array.validate\r\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 97, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Values length (6) is not equal to the length (1) multiplied by the value size (2)\r\n```\r\nCame up while looking at ARROW-13222. I'm not sure of the check here is necessarily valid, given slicing; it should perhaps only check that values length >= length \\* value_size, not that they're exactly equal.",
