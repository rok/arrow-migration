        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12293](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12293). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am learning DataFusion and tried to do the canonical big data version of hello world, word count, using DataFusion. \u00a0I have been unsuccessful, and I am wondering if word count is even currently possible with DataFusion.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTypically word count involves a flat_map where you split each string based on the white space contained within each string. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are two issues I am running into\r\n\r\n1) creating a udf that goes from &str -> Vec<&str>. \u00a0I cannot find an `arrow::array` that maps to a collection of string, which is preventing me from creating a udf that can perform the split.\r\n\r\n2) Assuming I could get `1` to work, I am not aware of a method that is similar to flat_map that may be performed on a column. \u00a0In sql, I believe this is called `explode`, which I can't find in the codebase, which makes me think flat_map style operations aren't possible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\nIs word count currently possible in DataFusion? \u00a0If so, how can perform the split and how can you perform a flat_map? \u00a0If word count cannot be done, what would need to be implemented to make it possible?",
