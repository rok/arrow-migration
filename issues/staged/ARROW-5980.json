Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have installed the\u00a0pyarrow 0.14.0 but it seems that by default you did not provide symlink of libarrow.so and libarrow_python.so. Only .so file with version suffix is provided. Hence, I cannot use the output of pyarrow.get_libraries() and pyarrow.get_library_dirs() to build my link option. \r\n\r\nIf you provide symlink, I can pass following to the linker to specify the library to link. e.g. g++ -L/<install_location> -larrow -larrow_python \r\n\r\nHowever, right now, the ld ouput complains not being able to find -larrow and -larrow_python",
