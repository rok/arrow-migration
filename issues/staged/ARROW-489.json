Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the case of the conversion of a list column to a pandas column, currently we always do a copy even though in the numeric case, we could avoid it most of the time. To enable zero-copy conversions, we need to pass a Python reference to a `pyarrow.Column` to the `ConvertColumnToPandas`\u00a0inside of `ConvertListsLike`. ",
