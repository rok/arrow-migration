Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom the documentation:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nAs an example, decimal128(7, 3) can exactly represent the numbers 1234.567 and -1234.567 (encoded internally as the 128-bit integers 1234567 and -1234567, respectively), but neither 12345.67 nor 123.4567.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n...but when we try this, we get:\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\nlibrary(arrow, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\nArray$create(1234.567, type = decimal128(7, 3))\r\n#> Error: NotImplemented: Extend\r\n```\r\n",
