        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12746](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12746). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent version of the Flight Client AuthHandler calls `NewOutgoingMetadata` instead of `AppendToOutgoingContext` which results in overwriting any metadata that was being passed in the request. Switching it to `AppendToOutgoingContext` alleviates the issue by adding the auth header to the metadata without overwriting any existing metadata.",
