Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are instantiating multiple versions of templates in this module for cases that, byte-wise, do the exact same comparison. For example:\r\n\r\n- For equals, not_equals, we can use the same 32-bit/64-bit comparison kernels for signed int / unsigned int / floating point types of the same byte width\n- TimestampType can reuse int64 kernels, similarly for other date/time types\n- BinaryType/StringType can share kernels\n  \n  etc.",
