Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLooking at [the flatbuffers doc](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_tutorial.html), it appears there should only be one `root_type` declaration in an fbs file:\r\n```java\n\r\nThe last part of the schema is the root_type. The root type declares what will be the root table for the serialized data. In our case, the root type is our Monster table.\n```\r\nHowever, the Tensor.fbs file has multiple `root_type` declarations:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/69d595ae4c61902b3f2778e536fca6675350c88c/format/Tensor.fbs#L53>\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/69d595ae4c61902b3f2778e536fca6675350c88c/format/Tensor.fbs#L146>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee the discussion here:\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2546#discussion_r256549256",
