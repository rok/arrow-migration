Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is an improvement of the `addValue`\u00a0method.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the method returns a boolean, indicating if the value has been successfully added to the dictionary.\r\n\r\nAfter the change, the method returns an integer, which is the position of the value in the dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this change:\r\n1. the dictionary position contains more information, compared with a boolean indicating if the value is added successfully.\n1. this information about the index in the dictionary can be useful, for example, to collect statistics about the dictionary.\n   \n   With the dictionary position, the information about if a value has been added can be easily determined.",
