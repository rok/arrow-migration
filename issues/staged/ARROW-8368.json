        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8368](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8368). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current implication of the C Interface is that only moving a single child out of an ArrowArray is allowed. \r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n- Should it be allowed to move multiple children, as long as they are moved at the same time, and the parent is released after?\n- In the event that children have disjoint internal resources, should there be a clarification around moved children having their resources released independently?\n  \n  See mailing list discussion https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r92b77e0fa7bed384daa377e2178bc8e8ca46103928598050341e40b1%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E",

This is the producer's choice. It may for example use a single arena for all allocations in the array tree, and only release resources when all release callbacks have been called.\r\n"
