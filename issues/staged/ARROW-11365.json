Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nV2 of the writer produces schema like:\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 required INT32 fieldname INTEGER(32, true);\r\n\r\nWe should support parsing this format, as it maps to logical types.\r\nI'm unsure of what the implications are for fields that don't have a logical type representation, but have a converted type (e.g. INTERVAL). We can try write a V2 file with parquet-cpp and observe the behaviour.",
