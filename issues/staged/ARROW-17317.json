Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should use X.Y instead of X.Y.Z (e.g.: 8.0 not 8.0.1) for previous version document directory.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-9.0.0/dev/release/post-08-docs.sh#L84\r\n\r\nThe script should accept X.Y.Z such as 8.0.1 and normalize it to X.Y. It'll reduce human error.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow-site/pull/228#issuecomment-1205997067\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow-site/pull/228#issuecomment-1206085602",
