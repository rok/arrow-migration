Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current implementation creates a thread per block and in the CSV reader this hurts performance just a bit.\u00a0 However, in the IPC reader this hurts performance even more.\r\n\r\nInstead the readahead can move inside the background generator and the background generator task can keep running until the queue fills up and then restart when the queue has drained enough for a substantial amount of work to be done.\r\n\r\nIn my test CSV case this dropped the # of thread tasks created from ~2.5k to ~100.",
