I'm working on a patch for that shortly, perhaps we can then document (and make any redefinitions / modifications if necessary) the Buffer metadata in a way that can be portable to multiple transport layers. I think we are already doing that (for example: in an RPC or file setting, the buffer is an offset relative to the start of the entire RPC message/file, and any shared memory page id is not meaningful), but we can make this more concrete"
