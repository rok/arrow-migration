        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17464](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17464). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHalf-float values are not supported in Parquet. Here is a previous issue that talks about that: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1647\r\n\r\nSo, this will not work:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\nimport numpy as np\r\narr = pa.array(np.float16([0.1, 2.2, 3]))\r\ntable = pa.table({'a': arr})\r\npq.write_table(table, \"test_halffloat.parquet\") \n```\r\n`This is a proposal to store float16 values in Parquet as FixedSizeBinary, and then restore them to float16 when reading them back in.`",

Do I open an issue in the Parquet Jira?"
