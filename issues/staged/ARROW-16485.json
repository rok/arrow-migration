Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is an extension to the ARROW-15590. The main focus is to address the following issues.\u00a0\r\n\r\n1. Support set of equality expressions as the join expression\r\n2. Output handling (user provides the left and right outputs)\r\n3. Support other (except INNER) join types: This requires mapping of existing Substrait Join definitions to Arrow supported Join types\r\n4. Filter support: This requires mapping Substrait `post_join_filter` to `filter` in `HashJoinNodeOptions`",
