        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6585](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6585). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur current `-DARROW_*` flag system strikes me as a little bit tedious. When invoking Boost's build system, you can pass the argument `--with-libraries=filesystem,regex,system` to indicate which components you want to see built. \r\n\r\nI think we should do a couple of things declare all component dependencies in a central place. Presently we have many \"if\" statements toggling on dependencies on an ad hoc basis. The code looks like this\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nif(ARROW_FLIGHT OR ARROW_PARQUET OR ARROW_BUILD_TESTS)\r\n  set(ARROW_IPC ON)\r\nendif()\r\n\r\nif(ARROW_IPC AND NOT ARROW_JSON)\r\n  message(FATAL_ERROR \"JSON support is required for Arrow IPC\")\r\nendif()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think this is going to be scalable. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I think we should make it easier to ask for a comprehensive build. E.g. `-DARROW_LIBRARIES=everything` or similar",
