Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-16510, I upgraded the version of the bundled google-cloud-cpp, which adds a dependency on zlib. If zlib is bundled, depending on the timing of the external project builds, it may not be available in time for the google-cloud-cpp build. I haven't observed this failing on any of the arrow CI jobs, but I have seen it on https://github.com/ursa-labs/arrow-r-nightly/runs/7103912666?check_suite_focus=true. ",
