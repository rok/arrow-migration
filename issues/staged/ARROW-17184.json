        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17184](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17184). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n**Update:** We currently do not print a plan for nested queries as that would involve the execution of the inner most query / queries. That is likely the reason why, in the chunk below, we do not see the filter and arrange nodes.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n**Original description:**\r\n\r\nNow that we can print an ExecPlan (ARROW-15016), we can investigate unexpected outputs. With the following chunk of code:\r\n```r\n\r\nmtcars %>%\r\n  arrow_table() %>%\r\n  select(mpg, wt, cyl) %>% \r\n  filter(mpg > 20) %>%\r\n  arrange(desc(wt)) %>%\r\n  head(3) %>%\r\n  show_exec_plan()\r\n#> ExecPlan with 3 nodes:\r\n#> 2:SinkNode{}\r\n#>   1:ProjectNode{projection=[mpg, wt, cyl]}\r\n#>     0:SourceNode{}\r\n```\r\n \\* FilterNode disappears when head/tail are involved +\r\n \\* we do not have additional information regarding the OrderBySinkNode\r\n \\* the entry point is a SourceNode and not a TableSourceNode",

When the FetchNode PR lands and we can handle all of this in a single plan, this will be resolved. So there is no extra action to take here."
