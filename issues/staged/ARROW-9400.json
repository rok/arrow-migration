Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBased on https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/blob/e9bb3f58eca79107baede71cb9b05311705a10f2/cfep-18.md it appears that static libraries may not be included in the future in many packages that we use for building the Windows Python wheels. We should change the build to use BUNDLED builds so we don't have this issue",

Thus I figured, we must have already switched most of them to BUNDLED anyways."
