Once [PR 12433](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12433) is merged you will be able to use `date()` to extract the date component of a timestamp. We aim to cover\u00a0`as.Date()` as part of the \u00a0same pull request.\r\n\r\nThe snippet of code below should work once we merge the PR. Please note `base::as.Date()` by default assumes you want the date in UTC :\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\n\r\ndf <- tibble::tibble(\r\n  col1 = lubridate::as_datetime(\"2010-08-03 00:50:50\", tz = \"Europe/London\"),\r\n)\r\n\r\n# lubridate\r\ndf %>% \r\n  mutate(x = date(col1),\r\n         y = as.Date(col1))\r\n#> # A tibble: 1 \u00d7 3\r\n#>   col1                x          y         \r\n#>   <dttm>              <date>     <date>    \r\n#> 1 2010-08-03 00:50:50 2010-08-03 2010-08-02\r\n\r\n# arrow\r\ndf %>% \r\n  arrow_table() %>% \r\n  mutate(x = date(col1),\r\n         y = as.Date(col1)) %>% \r\n  collect()\r\n#> # A tibble: 1 \u00d7 3\r\n#>   col1                x          y         \r\n#>   <dttm>              <date>     <date>    \r\n#> 1 2010-08-03 00:50:50 2010-08-03 2010-08-02\r\n```"

I would also like to encourage you to contribute if you think that's something you might want to do.\u00a0\r\nOn the timezone aspect, that is slightly trickier, Arrow currently transforms the timestamp into UTC and any timezone is store as metadata only. As such, casting with a different timezone (as the base R behaviour) is not immediately possible. There are several\u00a0tickets (for example, ARROW-15806) looking into this and hopefully this will be solved sometime in the near(ish) future."
