Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm installing Arrow 3.0.0 from CRAN on RedHat UBI. On 2021-04-21, my post-installation unit tests for Arrow started to fail. I found this error message in the build logs:\r\n\r\n`*** Successfully retrieved C++ source`\r\n`/bin/gtar: This does not look like a tar archive`\r\n`/bin/gtar: Skipping to next header`\r\n`/bin/gtar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors`\r\n`*** Proceeding without C++ dependencies`\r\n`Warning message:`\r\n`In untar(tf1, exdir = src_dir) :`\r\n` \u2018/bin/gtar -xf '/tmp/RtmpNhfLVX/file23a66db9da04' -C '/tmp/RtmpNhfLVX/file23a640ab53bd'\u2019 returned error code 2`\u00a0\r\n\r\nOther installation steps and downloads are working, so I don't think this is a network connectivity issue. My guess is that the mirror selection logic changed on the server side, so that the source download now saves an HTML error page instead of the source archive.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/maint-3.0.x/r/tools/linuxlibs.R#L221-L224>\r\n\r\nI'm fixing my build break by switching to binary downloads. But I thought you might want to have a look at that source download logic.",

And they had been working again for a few days after I switched to binary downloads. So I'm reasonably sure that all the prerequisites are in place. The message about required binary packages is always printed for a binary install, it's not the result of a check.\r\n\r\nThe error messages from the unit tests are \"cannot call <whatever>\". Looks like a generic error message when a dynamic library cannot be loaded.\r\n\r\ntest-arrow.r:48: error: arrow R is usable\r\nCannot call Array__from_vector().

Could it be that the download problems are because bintray is serving warning pages with the shutdown notice?\r\n\r\nOh... I just noticed that I install first the Arrow package from CRAN, then pyarrow from PyPI. If I reverse the installation order, maybe the CRAN package picks up the binary from the pyarrow wheel."

In any case, the upcoming 4.0 release (coming this week) eliminates all bintray. \r\n\r\nIn your first error log, it looks like Arrow C++ source downloaded but untar failed. That likely means that you got a bad response from an Apache mirror. I would expect that to succeed on retry."

Problems with the Apache mirrors sound like a reasonable explanation. But I had consistent build failures over several hours, and again on the following morning. So it was probably more than just a single bad mirror.\r\n\r\nAfter the binary failure yesterday, I did another build with source download. The installation succeeded, but unit tests failed, so there is still a problem in my environment. I'm trying again now. I'll close this issue, because the source downloads seem to be working again."
