Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we moved to using ExecPlans instead of Scanner, the metadata from the input table was dropped. We preserved the R metadata but not anything else. It turned out that `sfarrow` was relying on extra metadata, and this caused reverse dependency failures in the 8.0.0 release.",
