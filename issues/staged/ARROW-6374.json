        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6374](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6374). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is based on the discussion in\u00a0[https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/836d3b87ccb6e65e9edf0f220829a29edfa394fc2cd1e0866007d86e@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E.](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/836d3b87ccb6e65e9edf0f220829a29edfa394fc2cd1e0866007d86e@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E,)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe internals of TimeXXVectors are simply IntVector or BigIntVector. There are duplicated code for setting/getting int/long.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe want to refactor the code by:\r\n1. push get/set methods into the base class BaseFixedWidthVector, and make them protected.\n1. The APIs in TimeXXVectors references the methods in the base class.\n   \n   \u00a0\n   \n   Note that this issue not just reduce redundant code, it also centralizes the logics for getting/setting int/long, making them easy to maintain and change.\n   \n   \u00a0\n   \n   If it looks good, later we will make other integer based vectors rely on the base class implementations.\u00a0",
