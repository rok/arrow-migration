I'm not sure when this was introduced but I ran into this while integrating 0.14.1 into our build system.\u00a0 I think a simple fix is to only build the `arrow/json`\u00a0sources when `ARROW_WITH_RAPIDJSON`\u00a0is true.\u00a0"

Because we use bundled RapidJSON when we can't find system RapidJSON. If we specify `-DRappidJSON_SOURCE=SYSTEM` and there is no system RapidJSON, `cmake` must reports error. So we can't build Arrow."
