Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe've been running into a couple issues that seem to stem from the sqlparser crate, such as it not supporting columns that begin with a leading underscore.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the upgrade for DataFusion to sqlparser-0.5 (or even 0.3) seems to be non-trivial.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs this planned?",

I've started creating new 0.2.x releases to add things we need here.\r\n\r\nI am considering forking sqlparser 0.2.x into a separate crate.\r\n\r\nIt might also be worth donating sqlparser 0.2.x to this project if we can get agreement from all contributors.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
