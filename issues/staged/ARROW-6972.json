Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe C# implementation of Arrow does not support struct arrays and, complex types more generally.\r\n\r\n\u00a0I notice ARROW-6870\u00a0addresses Dictionary arrays however this is not as flexible as structs (for example, cannot mix data types)\r\n\r\nThe source does have a stub for StructArray however there is no Builder nor example on how to use it so I can assume it is not supported.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

We are tracking it with [issue 654](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/issues/654).  To support this, we need to be able to create a StructArray with StructType/Fields.  However, when attempting to create these, we run into the following exception:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nProcessStream() failed with exception: System.NotImplementedException: The method or operation is not implemented.\r\n   at Apache.Arrow.Ipc.ArrowTypeFlatbufferBuilder.TypeVisitor.Visit(IArrowType type)\r\n   at Apache.Arrow.Types.ArrowType.Accept[T](T type, IArrowTypeVisitor visitor)\r\n   at Apache.Arrow.Types.StructType.Accept(IArrowTypeVisitor visitor)\r\n   at Apache.Arrow.Ipc.ArrowStreamWriter.SerializeSchema(Schema schema)\r\n   at Apache.Arrow.Ipc.ArrowStreamWriter.WriteSchemaAsync(Schema schema, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n   at Apache.Arrow.Ipc.ArrowStreamWriter.WriteRecordBatchInternalAsync(RecordBatch recordBatch, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n   at Microsoft.Spark.Worker.Command.ArrowOrDataFrameGroupedMapCommandExecutor.ExecuteArrowGroupedMapCommand(Stream inputStream, Stream outputStream, SqlCommand[] commands) in D:\\Source\\Repos\\github\\suhsteve\\spark\\src\\csharp\\Microsoft.Spark.Worker\\Command\\SqlCommandExecutor.cs:line 770\r\n   at Microsoft.Spark.Worker.Command.ArrowOrDataFrameGroupedMapCommandExecutor.ExecuteCore(Stream inputStream, Stream outputStream, SqlCommand[] commands) in D:\\Source\\Repos\\github\\suhsteve\\spark\\src\\csharp\\Microsoft.Spark.Worker\\Command\\SqlCommandExecutor.cs:line 740\r\n   at Microsoft.Spark.Worker.Command.SqlCommandExecutor.Execute(Stream inputStream, Stream outputStream, PythonEvalType evalType, SqlCommand[] commands) in D:\\Source\\Repos\\github\\suhsteve\\spark\\src\\csharp\\Microsoft.Spark.Worker\\Command\\SqlCommandExecutor.cs:line 75\r\n   at Microsoft.Spark.Worker.Command.CommandExecutor.Execute(Stream inputStream, Stream outputStream, Int32 splitIndex, CommandPayload commandPayload) in D:\\Source\\Repos\\github\\suhsteve\\spark\\src\\csharp\\Microsoft.Spark.Worker\\Command\\CommandExecutor.cs:line 57\r\n   at Microsoft.Spark.Worker.TaskRunner.ProcessStream(Stream inputStream, Stream outputStream, Version version, Boolean& readComplete) in D:\\Source\\Repos\\github\\suhsteve\\spark\\src\\csharp\\Microsoft.Spark.Worker\\TaskRunner.cs:line 153\r\n```\r\n"
