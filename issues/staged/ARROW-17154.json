The question is if it is necessary to change the name of `arrow_python` cmake project. I agree it would be cleaner and more understandable to have all instances of PyArrow C++ named the same. But am not sure if it is necessary and what issues would follow after this change.\r\n\r\nI suggest to close this issue without a change by the end of this week if there is no strong opinion for opposite (to rename the `arrow_python` cmake project).\r\n\r\ncc `[~apitrou]` `[~jorisvandenbossche]` `[~kou]` \u00a0"

It removes the CMake project name in `python/pyarrow/src/CMakeLists.txt`. So we don't need to rename it."
