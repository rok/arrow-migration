        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12266](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12266). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImprove null handling of\u00a0\r\n\r\nSELECT id1, id2 FROM (SELECT null AS id1) t1\r\n INNER JOIN (SELECT 0 AS id2) t2 ON id1 = id2\r\n\r\n> NULL, NULL\r\n\r\n(should be empty result set)\r\n\r\nWe should filter beforehand to make this result correct. Also this can make things more efficient as the non-null filter can be pushed down which can lead to efficiency gains (making data-set smaller, not having to deal with nullable data, or even entire files could be skipped when they only contain nulls).",
