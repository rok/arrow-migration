Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInitially this will be specific to datasets (since we have don't have well defined backpressure in the plan itself yet) but there should be a way for a consumer to inspect an executing datasets operation to know if backpressure is being applied because they are consuming the data too slowly.\r\n\r\nA simple implementation might be a callback that is triggered each time backpressure is applied.  Longer term we might want something with more extensive visibility into a running query that is integrated with any tracing utilities.",
