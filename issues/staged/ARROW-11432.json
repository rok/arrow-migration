I think when building the TableScan, it allocates a table_name, but the returned`datafusion::logical_plan::dfschema::DFField`'s have no reference to the provided table name. Attempting to join the schemas (in `datafusion::logical_plan::dfschema::DFSchema::new`) then results in a list of fields with conflicting names as they lack qualifiers.\r\n\r\nI am new to DataFusion but would be happy to add some unit tests and try to look at this on the weekend."

When building a join schema, it checks if the join set is valid (physical_plan::hash_utils::check_join_set_is_valid), which has a parent public API call (physical_plan::hash_utils::check_join_is_valid). This join is unaware of the registered name (CSV or parquet) as it is performed with arrow schemas rather than DataFusion schemas.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nIt could be my lack of knowledge of the DataFusion codebase, but it appears it would need a lot of changes."
