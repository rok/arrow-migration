        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1346](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1346). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nsetuptools is internally using easy_install for pulling packages from pypi. easy_install doesn't support wheel so since pyarrow is in pypi distributed only as wheels it is not possible to package a product depending on pyarrow using setuptools.\n\nsee attached [setup.py](setup.py):\n```Java\n$ python setup.py test\nrunning test\nSearching for pyarrow==0.5.0.post2\nReading https://pypi.python.org/simple/pyarrow/\nNo local packages or working download links found for pyarrow==0.5.0.post2\nerror: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('pyarrow==0.5.0.post2')\n```\n\nIt's a shame setuptools don't support wheels. unfortunately it supports only eggs or raw source packages (see [distro_for_location](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/master/setuptools/package_index.py#L112)). I am not suggesting providing eggs but perhaps publishing raw tar.gz should be considered so that setuptools can at least build the dependency itself.",

I'm pretty surprised by this. In production deployments I usually see `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and pip knows how to install wheels"

Any version of setuptools (I am on the latest 36.2.7).\n\nThe attached [setup.py](setup.py) demonstrates the problem - ie if I am trying to distribute my python project that depends on pyarrow as per the [setup.py](setup.py) it won't pull pyarrow out of the box (running the typical `python setup.py install` fails as per the error shown above due to the setuptools inability to pull wheels from pypi)."

See associated discussion in the TensorFlow issue tracker https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6540 (\"Building and distributing an egg file is not planned for tensorflow, as it is the old deprecated standard. I will close this issue now.\") . I would recommend changing your software deployment process to use pip and requirements.txt. You can also use conda to achieve the same result. "

No probs. It's just odd that setuptools is still the main python packaging concept that can nicely define dependencies ([even in pyarrow iself](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/setup.py#L371)) and is unable to deploy such packages itself (in case of wheel deps) but needs another tools to resolve its dependencies. But I understand this is not a problem of arrow...\n"
