        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6971](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6971). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs part of the recent reader work we introduced\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n// arrow::record_batch::RecordBatchReader\n```\r\nbut in datafusion we have\r\n```java\n\r\n// datafusion::physical_plan::BatchIterator\r\n```\r\nThese two trait are almost identical (BatchIterator implements Send + Sync whereas RecordBatchReader does not).\u00a0 I propose we replace RecordBatchReader with BatchIterator (i.e. move it to arrow as it's generally useful outside of datafusion) and update parquet and data fusion accordingly.\r\n\r\n`[~andygrove]` `[~liurenjie1024]` \u00a0do you see any issues with this?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
