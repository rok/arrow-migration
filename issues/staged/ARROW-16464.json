Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow C++, PyArrow and perhaps other bindings have CUDA support, but none is currently tested on CI, and I think few of the contributors enable CUDA on their local builds.\r\n\r\nWe should definitely exercise CUDA support, at least in the nightly builds where we may have more flexibility to use custom machines.",
