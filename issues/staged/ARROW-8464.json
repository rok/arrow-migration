Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUsecases: Efficiently process large columns of low cardinality Strings\r\n\u00a0\r\n \\* BatchIterator should accept both DictionaryBatch and RecordBatch\r\n \\* Type Coercion optimizer rule should inject expression for converting dictionary value types to index types (for equality expressions, and IN(values, ...)\r\n \\* Physical expression would lookup index for dictionary values referenced in the query so that at runtime, only indices are being compared per batch",
