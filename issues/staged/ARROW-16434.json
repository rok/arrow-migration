We do add to the PATH like we need to (though `/mingw64/bin` might be missing from the new one, if I'm looking at the contents correctly?)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/6251653187?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\necho 'options(repos=structure(c(CRAN=\"https://cloud.r-project.org\")))'\r\n21\r\n+ pacman --sync --refresh --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-ccache mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl\r\n22\r\n:: Synchronizing package databases...\r\n23\r\ndownloading mingw32.db...\r\n24\r\ndownloading mingw64.db...\r\n25\r\ndownloading ucrt64.db...\r\n26\r\ndownloading mirrors.db...\r\n27\r\nresolving dependencies...\r\n28\r\nlooking for conflicting packages...\r\n29\r\n\r\n30\r\nPackages (4) mingw-w64-x86_64-ccache-3.7.9-1  mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake-3.21.3-1  mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja-1.10.2-1  mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl-1.1.1.m-9800\r\n31\r\n\r\n32\r\nTotal Download Size:    17.13 MiB\r\n33\r\nTotal Installed Size:  110.39 MiB\r\n34\r\n\r\n35\r\n:: Proceed with installation?

It's very strange, it's using the wrong cmake too (version is newer than what's in rtools-packages) and R 4.2 seems to come pre-installed on those machines.\r\n\r\nI think it has to do with upgrading to the setup-r@v2 action, which was done in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13011 **after** running the crossbow job. Not a terrible judgement, as we shouldn't expect that setup to affect much downstream, but does seem to be the reason we didn't catch earlier."
