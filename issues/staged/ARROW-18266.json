        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18266](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18266). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's not all that clear from our docs that if we want to read in a Parquet file and change the schema, we need to call the `cast()` method on the Table, e.g. \r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n# Write out data\r\ndata <- tibble::tibble(x = c(letters[1:5], NA), y = 1:6)\r\ndata_with_schema <- arrow_table(data, schema = schema(x = string(), y = int64()))\r\nwrite_parquet(data_with_schema, \"data_with_schema.parquet\")\r\n\r\n# Read in data while specifying a schema\r\ndata_in <- read_parquet(\"data_with_schema.parquet\", as_data_frame = FALSE)\t\r\ndata_in$cast(target_schema = schema(x = string(), y = int32()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should document this more clearly. Pehaps we could even update the code here to automatically do some of this if we pass in a schema to the `...` argument of `read_parquet` _and_ the returned data doesn't match the desired schema? ",
