        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7080](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7080). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm in the process of adding parquet read support to Iceberg(<https://iceberg.apache.org/>), and we use the parquet field_ids as a consistent id when reading a parquet file to create a map between the current schema and the\u00a0schema of the file being read.\u00a0 Unless I've missed something, it appears that field_id is not exposed in the python APIs in pyarrow._parquet.ParquetSchema nor is it available in pyarrow.lib.Schema.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add this to either of those two objects?",
