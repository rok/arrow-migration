        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16005](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16005). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`ArrowVectorIterator` does not currently work with arrays.\r\n\r\nOne issue is that initializing the `ArrayConsumer` requires `ListVector#getDataVector` but currently this is called before the `VectorSchemaRoot` is initialized so there is no `ListVector` to pass: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/adapter/jdbc/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/adapter/jdbc/ArrowVectorIterator.java#L76.>\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"org.apache.arrow.vector.complex.ListVector.getDataVector()\" because \"vector\" is null\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 at org.apache.arrow.adapter.jdbc.JdbcToArrowUtils.getConsumer(JdbcToArrowUtils.java:432)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 at org.apache.arrow.adapter.jdbc.ArrowVectorIterator.initialize(ArrowVectorIterator.java:74)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 at org.apache.arrow.adapter.jdbc.ArrowVectorIterator.create(ArrowVectorIterator.java:91)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ... 72 more \n```\r\nA second issue comes when there are multiple batches. `ArrayConsumer#resetValueVector` does not currently do anything with the delegate. As a result, `ListVector#dataVector` does not have its index reset which is an issue when reusing the `{}VectorSchemaRoot{`}.\u00a0",
