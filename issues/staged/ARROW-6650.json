Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[~emkornfield@gmail.com]\u00a0recommended that we use the integration IPC files. To be able to compare against the JSON files that are used, we need to be able to generate a JSON represention of Arrow data in Rust.\r\n\r\nWe can already do this for schemas, and this ticket is for supporting converting RecordBatch to JSON.",

I'm instead reading in an integration JSON file into a struct, and then comparing that against a schema and record batches.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI've made good progress already, but I'll need to rework the json logic in `datatypes.rs`. Completing this PR paves the way for me to use the integration datasets for testing against the reader, and then we can merge the arrow reader in."
