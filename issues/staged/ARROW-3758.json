        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3758](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3758). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe status quo for building the R package with the C++ library is a bit special (see procedure [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW/Release+Management+Guide#ReleaseManagementGuide-UpdatingCRANpackages)) and requires that compilation happen with\u00a0a specific toolchain for R. There is no guidance on how to get a successful build locally on Windows, and it's not covered by our CI so we are vulnerable to regression.\r\n\r\nGoal for this ticket: recreate the environment from <https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-backports>\u00a0in our Appveyor so that we can build and test R with C++ in continuous integration. Side effect of bringing the `PKGBUILD` configuration that the r-windows setup uses into our source control for easier release management. This should also get us closer to, perhaps arriving at, reproducible build steps for local Windows developers.",
