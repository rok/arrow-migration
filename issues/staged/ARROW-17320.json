        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17320](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17320). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSpawning from ARROW-17106, moving code from `pyarrow/parquet/_init_{_}` to `pyarrow/parquet/core` and re-exporting in `_i{_}{_}nit_{_}` to maintain the same functionality.\r\n\r\n[pyarrow._init_](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/__init__.py)is very careful about what is exposed through the public API by prefixing private symbols with underscores, even imports.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat's exposed at the top level of ``{}pyarrow.parquet{`}`, however, is not so careful. API calls such as ``{}pq.FileSystem{`}`, ``{}pq.pa.Array{`}`, ``{}pq.json{`}` are all valid and should probably be designated as private attributes in `{}pyarrow.parquet{`}.",

If someone would run into it, it is easy to fix in your code. \r\n\r\nBut starting to add deprecation warnings for those sounds quite onerous for the value it would provide.\r\n\r\n(we only need to remember to add `\\_filters_to_expression` to the list, since that is used by other projects)"
