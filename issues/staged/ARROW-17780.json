If so, it's now deprecated in favour of using `across()` inside `summarise()` instead.  The good news is that `across()` for `summarise()` has recently been implemented in the dev version of Arrow and should be out in the next release.  Will this enable you to do what you need to?"

You'll be able to achieve what you need to with `summarise()` and `across()` - this functionality will be in Arrow after the next release and is already in the dev version."
