Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe streaming CSV reader is missing from the C++ documentation.  The table reader is documented here: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/formats.html?highlight=tablereader#_CPPv4N5arrow3csv11TableReaderE\r\n\r\nThe references to streaming reader are missing from `docs/source/cpp/api/formats.rst`.  In addition, we should probably add an example of using the streaming CSV reader to this page: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/csv.html\r\n\r\nWe should probably also add a short paragraph describing the tradeoffs between the two.",
