        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10930](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10930). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis one is easy: it looks like the LargeListType is just missing this field. Here it is for a 32-bit list (the reason I want this is to get at the \"nullable\" field, although the \"metadata\" would be nice, too):\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> small_array = pa.ListArray.from_arrays(pa.array([0, 3, 3, 5]), pa.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]))\r\n>>> small_array.type.value_field\r\npyarrow.Field<item: double>\r\n>>> small_array.type.value_field.nullable\r\nTrue\n```\r\nNow with a large list:\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> large_array = pa.LargeListArray.from_arrays(pa.array([0, 3, 3, 5]), pa.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]))\r\n>>> large_array.type.value_field\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nAttributeError: 'pyarrow.lib.LargeListType' object has no attribute 'value_field'\n```\r\nVerifying version:\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> pa.__version__\r\n'2.0.0'\n```",
