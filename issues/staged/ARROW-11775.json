Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs more features are added to DataFusion more dependencies will inevitably be required. To reduce the cost of importing and compiling these dependencies for projects that do not need the functionality it is proposed to use rust 'feature flags' (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html) to be able to control this easily.",
