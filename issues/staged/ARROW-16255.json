Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently there is a bit of mish-mash. Most bindings are defined in `R/dplyr-funcs-datetime.R`, while sole are in `R/dplyr-funcs-type.R`. We have also set a cyclomatic complexity threshold of 26 so this should be an opportunity to reduce it more towards the default of 15. ",
