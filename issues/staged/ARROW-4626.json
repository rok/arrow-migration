Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs [proposed on the mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c550264cd60e000d77e10d9d7ac81ea8c49efc37ad447177fa8ee4ee@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E), we should add a field for application-specific metadata in DoGet payloads and expose this in the APIs. The current APIs are rather RecordBatch-oriented, though.",
