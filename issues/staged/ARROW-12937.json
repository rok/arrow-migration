Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe S3 filesystem recognizes some metadata keys with `OpenOutputStream`, such as `Content-Language` or `ACL` (see ARROW-12719). It would be useful, especially for ACLs, to be able to set default values at the filesystem level itself.",
