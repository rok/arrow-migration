Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTest and benchmark harness sometimes has a non-trivial cost when generating large random data (e.g. `vector_sort_benchmark.cc`). We may try a non-standard PRNG such as [PCG](https://www.pcg-random.org/using-pcg-cpp.html).",

Not sure that is sufficiently worthy. cc `[~bkietz]` and `[~fsaintjacques]` for opinion."
