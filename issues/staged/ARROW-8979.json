Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBelow three Jira tasks optimize bitmap operations(logical, copy, compare, etc) unaligned case. They use word-by-word approach instead of bit-by-bit to improve performance.\r\n There are some common code of read/write bitmap in words. It's better to implement word based bitmap reader and writer to wrap similar function and reduce code redundancy.\r\n https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8553\r\n https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8843\r\n https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8844",
