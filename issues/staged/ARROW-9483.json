Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, `gtest_util.h` contains a hodge-podge of different things.\r\nIt would be nice if things were separated a bit more, for example a `asserts.h` file for all home-grown assertion functions and macros.\r\nAlso a separate header for `ArrayFromVector` and friends, to avoid including `builder.h` everywhere.",
