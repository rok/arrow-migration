Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhenever we try to create an array or a Table from a GPU buffer we get the following Invalid missing values buffer error.\r\n```java\n\r\npyarrow/table.pxi:485: in pyarrow.lib.chunked_array\r\n ???\r\n _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ > ???\r\n E pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: In chunk 0: Invalid: Missing values buffer in non-empty arraypyarrow/error.pxi:84: ArrowInvalid\n```\r\nThis is because the GPU buffers aren't passing the following validation check: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/7be266be98d08214ef4b3f067059b6e6a8a6e5c0/cpp/src/arrow/array/validate.cc#L183>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut this has to be changed to something like:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nstatic bool IsBufferValid(const ArrayData& data, int index)\r\n{ return data.buffers[index] != nullptr && (data.buffers[index]->is_cpu() ? data.buffers[index]->data() != nullptr : true); }\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",
