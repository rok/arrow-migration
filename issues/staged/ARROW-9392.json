I am interested in helping out with this, at **least** with the portions that I will be using significantly in the near future. I figured pinging you first to orient myself made sense since you created this issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how much there is to do here, but I have just had trouble finding documentation myself and wanted to volunteer to contribute. (I posted to the mailing list in case a lot of this already exists:\u00a0<https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb0633480a9cf07d311d3a1143c2be1bce3a83e6ae5cf281ebb2cff9b%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E>)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor reference, my usage of the APIs will be related to\u00a0ARROW-10549, but with a different end goal.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks!"

Your offer to help is very much welcome.\r\n\r\nThe current documentation, as you probably figured out, is here: <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html>\r\n\r\nIt is mostly a listing of available compute functions and their semantics. It is probably missing a higher-level description of the compute layer and its design.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if you could tell what is missing for your understanding, and you can then start working on that (or you can help us achieve the desired level of understanding)."

I actually have not seen this particular page (not sure if I missed it, or if it came in a recent-ish update), so I think there is a lot to catch up on here.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne thing that I do find confusing, is that my research group tries to use the dataset API and expressions but I don't see any mention of these in the documentation. My impression is that expressions (or maybe the compute API?) came from gandiva, and perhaps the dataset and expression APIs are being coalesced into the compute API?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnyways, I will look over the documentation you linked and figure out what to do next. Thanks again!"

Since this was created there is now a \"Compute Functions\" section in the C++ API Reference, in addition to the \"Compute Functions\" section of the C++ User Guide that Antoine initially mentioned. Also, ARROW-11677 has been completed. At the very least, the points mentioned in the description seem to be mostly addressed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`[~edponce]` , I think you can close this."
