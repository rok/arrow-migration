        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13411](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13411). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor docs that are shipped with new arrow releases (C++, Python) we should serve the documentation related to the arrow version.\r\n\r\nAt the moment for example if I want to look at the docs for 3.0.0 there is no easy way, the version I end up to is always the one for the current release. Or if I want to look at the doc for the current version under development there is no easy way.\r\n\r\nWe could for example deploy the docs under subdirectories that match the arrow version they refer to.\r\n\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/4.0.1/python/\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/5.0.0/python/\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/python/\r\n\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/current could just become a redirect to the latest release\r\n\r\n",
