Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParquet file path lengths are limited to ~260 characters in Windows environments.  For example, the attached program runs successfully on Linux (provided the nested directories already exist), but fails on Windows.\r\n\r\nReplacing the currently used _wsopen() functions with their Win32 analogues fixes this.  A patch is forthcoming.",
