        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13166). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, there are very few scanning options which we can set in the Java Dataset API [1].\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the options that exist now always must be set from Java, without the possibility to use sensible default values from core Arrow.\r\n\r\nFor my use-case, I want to be able to set the `fragment_readahead` option from the Java-side.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt would be great if:\r\n\u00a0+ `ScanOptions.java` would be expanded to allow us to set more, potentially all options related to scanner creation.\r\n\u00a0+ Java users can omit options to use the default values, e.g. [2].\r\n\r\nIt would be good to know what others think, and whether a PR for this is useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/dataset/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/dataset/scanner/ScanOptions.java>\r\n[2]<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/ad5dc8207192abe71d3e88303252629041968508/cpp/src/arrow/dataset/scanner.h#L51-L53>",

As long as the option is defined in C++ side I think it would be no problem to add it to Java side. Probably we should add a builder API to Java ScanOptions when we add many new parameters."

It might be easier to hold off a bit, before we find ourselves in a position were we have to reimplement stuff again."

Still, it might be a good base. Shall I open a PR with the base code?"
