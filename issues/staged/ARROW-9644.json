Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSomewhat related to ARROW-8427, and from https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/7857\r\n\r\nI am not sure we should check the `ignore_prefixes` for the base path provided by the user. Because if that contains eg an underscore, it simply skips the full dataset resulting in an empty dataset.\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport tempfile\r\nimport pathlib\r\n\r\npath = tempfile.mkdtemp()\r\ntmpdir =  pathlib.Path(path)                                                                                                                                                              \r\n\r\n# base path with a directory with an underscore \r\ndatadir = tmpdir / \"_data\" / \"dataset\"                                                                                                                                                                    \r\ndatadir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)                                                                                                                                                                \r\n\r\n# create a parquet file at that location\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\ntable = pa.table({'a': [1, 2, 3]})                                                                                                                                                                        \r\npq.write_table(table, datadir / \"data.parquet\")                                                                                                                                                           \r\n\r\n# reading dataset skips everything\r\nimport pyarrow.dataset as ds                                                                                                                                                                              \r\n\r\nIn [26]: ds.dataset(datadir)                                                                                                                                                                                       \r\nOut[26]: <pyarrow._dataset.FileSystemDataset at 0x7fbfd8779bb0>\r\n\r\nIn [27]: ds.dataset(datadir).files                                                                                                                                                                                 \r\nOut[27]: []\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc `[~bkietz]` `[~npr]`",
