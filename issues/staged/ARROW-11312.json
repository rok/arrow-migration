Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently have TimestampArray::from_vec and TimestampArray::from_opt_vec in order to provide timezone information. We do not have an option that uses FromIter.\r\n\r\nWhen implementing this, we should search the codebase (esp Parquet) and replace the vector-based methods above with iterators where it makes sense.",
