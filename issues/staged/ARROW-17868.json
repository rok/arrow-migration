        "title": "[C++][Python] Keep and deprecate ARROW_PYTHON CMake option for backward compatibility",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17868](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17868). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-6858 removed `ARROW_PYTHON` CMake option because ARROW-16340 moved `cpp/src/arrow/python/` to `python/pyarrow/src/`. But it broke backward compatibility. Users who use `-DARROW_PYTHON=ON` needs to `-DARROW_CSV=ON`, `-DARROW_DATASET=ON` and so on manually.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14224#discussion_r981399130\r\n\r\n> FWIW this broke my local development because of no longer including those (although I should probably start using presets ..)\n> \n> Now, it's probably fine to remove this now Python C++ has moved, but we do assume that some C++ modules are built on the pyarrow side (eg we assume that CSV is always built, while with the above change you need to ensure manually that this is done in your cmake call).\n> In any case we should update the documentation at https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/developers/python.html#build-and-test to indicate that there are a few components required to be able to build pyarrow.\r\n\r\nEventually, we can remove `ARROW_PYTHON` CMake option but we should provide a deprecation period before we remove `ARROW_PYTHON`.\r\n\r\nWe should also mention that `ARROW_PYTHON` is deprecated in our documentation ( https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/developers/python.html#build-and-test ).",
