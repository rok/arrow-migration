Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a follow-up of ARROW-12175.\r\n\r\nWe introduced `${PACKAGE}::` prefix to all exported CMake targets such as `Arrow::arrow_shared` and `Arrow::arrow_static` but we also provides no namespaced CMake targets such as `arrow_shared` and `arrow_static` as aliases of namespaced CMake targets. But the backward compatibility feature isn't worked for `_shared`.",
