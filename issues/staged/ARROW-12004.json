Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I add a callback (using `AddCallback` or `Then`) to a `Future<T>`, I would like the callback to take a `Status` rather than a `Result<detail::Empty>`.\r\n\r\nI managed to get this done for `AddCallback`, but `Then` is another pile of complication due to template hackery.",
