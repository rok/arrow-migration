        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13158](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13158). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBroken off from ARROW-9997\r\n\r\nWhen having duplicate fields, the repr fails:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [28]: s = pa.scalar([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('a', 3)], pa.struct([('a', 'int64'), ('b', 'int64'), ('a', 'int64')]))\r\n\r\nIn [29]: 0 in s\r\nOut[29]: True\r\n\r\nIn [30]: s\r\n....\r\nKeyError: 'a'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, the contains (`in`) operation also shouldn't accept integers (this is also the case for non-duplicate fields)",
