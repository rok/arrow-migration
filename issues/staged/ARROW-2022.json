Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile we can have schema- and field-level custom metadata, we cannot send metadata at the record batch level. This could include things like statistics (although statistics isn't a great example, because this might be something we want to eventually standardize), but other things too\r\n\r\nSee message definitions in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Message.fbs",

E.g. if there is a numeric field f, you could pass the number of distinct values of f, the number of null values in f, and a histogram.\r\n\r\nIf a field is derived, it would be useful to pass along the expression that it computes as well as its value. That way, we could add new statistics without changing the format. Any consumer that didn't trust the data could take the time to re-compute the expression."
