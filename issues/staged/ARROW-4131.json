        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4131](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4131). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nContinuing <https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/3280>\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm seeing variants of this elsewhere (e.g.,\u00a0[wesm/feather#349](https://github.com/wesm/feather/issues/349)\u00a0) \u2013\r\n\r\nNot all Pandas tables coerce to Arrow tables, and when they fail, not in a way that is conducive to automation:\r\n\r\nSample:\r\n\r\n`mixed_df = pd.DataFrame(\\{'mixed': [1, 'b']}) pa.Table.from_pandas(mixed_df) => ArrowInvalid: ('Could not convert b with type str: tried to convert to double', 'Conversion failed for column mixed with type object') `\r\n\r\nI would have expected behaviors more like the following:\r\n \\* Coerce\u00a0`toString`\u00a0by default, with a default-off option to disallow toString coercions\r\n\r\n \\* Provide a default-off option to\u00a0`from_pandas`\u00a0to auto-coerce\r\n\r\n \\* Name the exception so it is clear that this is a column coercion failure, and include the column name(s), making this predictable and clearly handleable by both library writers & users\r\n\r\nI lean towards:\r\n \\* Defaults auto-coerce, improving life of early users, `coerce_mixed_columns_to_strings=True`\r\n \\* For less frequent yet more advanced library implementors,\u00a0allow them to override to `False`\r\n \\* In their case, create a predictable & machine-readable\u00a0exception, `MixedColumnException(mixed_columns=['a', 'b', ...], msg=\"....\")`",
