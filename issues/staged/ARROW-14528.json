        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14528](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14528). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExpose ARROW-13028 to the R bindings so that users can choose to have `read_csv_arrow(as_data_frame = FALSE)` and\u00a0`open_dataset(format = \"csv)`\u00a0infer 32-bit integer fields instead of always inferring 64-bit integer fields for all integers (the current behavior).\r\n\r\nNote that there is an existing option in the R bindings that controls something similar: `arrow.int64_downcast`. See\u00a0ARROW-10093 for details. I think we can\u00a0_not_ reuse this option to control the CSV reader, behavior because (a) users might want to control these behaviors separately, and (b) the default value of `arrow.int64_downcast`\u00a0is `TRUE`\u00a0which does not align with the existing behavior of the CSV reader (always inferring 64-bit integer fields, i.e. _not_ downcasting) and we probably want to retain that as the default behavior. So we will want to add a new argument or a new option to control this.",
