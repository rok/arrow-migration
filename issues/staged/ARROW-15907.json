Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor convenience, since the default method requires allocating an ArrowBuf and such. See [PR#11982 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11982#discussion_r814226648)\r\n\r\nIt's generated [in ComplexWriters.java](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/8088f71c5d545349a24812b9e516ab07c850d0c6/java/vector/src/main/codegen/templates/ComplexWriters.java#L190-L207), we could add an `if` and special-case VarChar to have a helper method that uses setBytes instead.",
