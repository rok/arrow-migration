These are such common packages, it probably didn't come up in your tests, but I have a minimal system.\r\n\r\n(It's not done with \"make\", but it\u00a0looks\u00a0promising so far.)",

I think this is due to a missing boost_system, but I can't see from the instructions on\r\n\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/development.html>\r\n\r\nwhat's missing.\r\n\r\nI had thought this was a simple omission from the instructions (and therefore an easy \"bug\" fix), but it's beginning to look like a long installation struggle. Should I move this to the Arrow developers mailing iist?"
