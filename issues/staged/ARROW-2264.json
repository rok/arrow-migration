Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLooking at the numpy array serialization code it seems that if I have a dtype like \"<U3\" this will go through custom ndarray serializer and not through an efficient one.\r\n\r\n`Example:``>>> np.array(['aaa', 'bbb'])`\r\n`array(['aaa', 'bbb'], dtype='<U3')`\r\n\r\nThis should be able to work, no? It has fixed offsets and memory layout.",
