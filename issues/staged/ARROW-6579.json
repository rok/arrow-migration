Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\npyarrow.parquet.write_to_dataset() is single-threaded now and converts the table from/to Pandas. We should lower the dataset writing to C++ (dropping Pandas usage) so it's easier to write the partitioned dataset using multiple threads.",
