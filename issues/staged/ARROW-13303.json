Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- Use es2015 sources in the apache-arrow package since webpack 4 does not support esnext and many people still use it\n- Generate .cjs and .mjs files instead of just .js to make it clear what the files are.
