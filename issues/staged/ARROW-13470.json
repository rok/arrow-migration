Adding\u00a0`message(\"Python libs: ${PYTHON_LIBRARIES}\")` to line 73 in [cpp/src/arrow/python](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/python/CMakeLists.txt#L72) yields this on Windows:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n[cmake] Python libs: optimized;C:/Users/voltron/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/libs/python310.lib;debug;C:/Users/voltron/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/libs/python310_d.lib\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this on my Mac:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n[cmake] Python libs: /Users/willjones/.pyenv/versions/3.8.12/lib/libpython3.8.a\r\n```\r\n\r\nI installed Python on Windows with debug symbols and debug library, and it seems that CMake is wanting to pass both the the linker. (I was getting an error trying to do a debug build on Windows without the Python debug library, which is why I reinstalled Python with that included.) However, I don't think this line of `add_arrow_lib()` is prepared for that: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/e291d0f408df588048b6971819fc4e65b0093154/cpp/cmake_modules/BuildUtils.cmake#L373"
