        "title": "[R] Install instructions on linux could be clearer",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6142](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6142). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstalling R packages on Linux is almost always from source, which means Arrow needs some system dependencies. The existing help message (from arrow::install_arrow()) is very helpful in pointing that out, but it's still a heavy lift for users who install R packages from source but don't plan to develop Arrow itself.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of things that could make things slightly smoother:\r\n1. I would be very grateful if the install_arrow() message or installation page told me which libraries were essential to make the R package work.\n1. install_arrow() refers to a PPA. Previously I've only seen PPAs hosted on launchpad.net, so the bintray URL threw me. Changing it to \"bintray.com PPA\" instead of just \"PPA\" would have caused me less confusion. (Others may differ)\n1. A snap package would be easier than installing a new apt address, but I understand that building for snap would be more packaging work and only benefits Ubuntu users.\n   \n   \u00a0\n   \n   Thanks for making R bindings, and congratulations on the CRAN release!",
