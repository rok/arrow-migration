        "title": "[Python][Doc] Refactor the FileSystem Interface documentation",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13699](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13699). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a python developer working with different cloud vendors and their storages I'd like to quickly jump to code examples on how to read and write files for each filesystem.\r\n\r\nThe documentation concerned is the python/filesystem doc: <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/filesystems.html>\r\n\r\nI find the information is a bit scattered and could be improved by having the following organisation.\r\n# Filesystem Interface\r\n\r\n_overview of the Pyarrow FS Interface_\r\n## Usage\r\n### Local Filesystem\r\n\r\n_description_\r\n#### Writing files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n#### Listing files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n#### Reading files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n### S3 Filesystem\r\n\r\n_description / configuration_\r\n#### Writing files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n#### Listing files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n#### Reading files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n### Hadoop Filesystem\r\n\r\n_description / configuration_\r\n#### Writing files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n#### Listing files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n#### Reading files\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n### Extending to fsspec-compatible filesystems\r\n\r\n_description_\r\n#### Google Cloud Storage\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n#### Azure\r\n\r\n_code example_\r\n\r\nThat way a developer working on s3 can directly jump to the section of interest and start experimenting with the code examples.\r\n Additionally if new python bindings are created for a \"Arrow native\" filesystem the documentation can be extended with a new section in same vein as the other.",

The documentation should probably keep a more tutorial/explaination style, if you are just looking for code snippets to copy/paste the cookbook is usually the place for those.\r\n\r\n`[~Nlte]` if you want to have a look at the cookbook the codebase is available at https://github.com/apache/arrow-cookbook and it's hosted on https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook"

But maybe you could do a PR with changes how you see it for one filesystem as a starter, and then we can discuss from there? "

For example mentioning Azure through fsspec could fit there as well?"
