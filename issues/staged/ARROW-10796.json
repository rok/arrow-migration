Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA RecordBatch is currently sorted as a one-chunk Table. It is suboptimal as it's paying the chunk resolution cost even though it's not necessary.\r\n\r\nA dedicated RecordBatch sort may also form the basis for a faster Table sort (first sort individual batches, then use merge sort along the sorted batches).\r\n",
