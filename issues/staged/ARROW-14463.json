Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis would give folks who plan on depending on arrow a place to know any of the complexities they might run into when depending on arrow. These shouldn't be many caveats, but some exist.\r\n\r\nOne that has come up: skipping tests when arrow features are not available. For example, if testing parquet writing `skip_if_not_available(\"parquet\")`. \r\n\r\nShould we include that skip in the arrow package itself? (it's currently in a test helper)",
