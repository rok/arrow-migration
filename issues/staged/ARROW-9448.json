Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nStill working on a reproduction (this is internal code), but what I see is:\r\n1. Test initializes a RootAllocator in a JUnit @Before\n1. BaseAllocator.<clinit> creates a Config\n1. The constructor of ImmutableConfig gets the allocation manager\n1. This eventually runs NettyAllocationManager.<clinit>\n1. This creates a static ArrowBuf as the empty buffer\n1. The ArrowBuf has a null HistoricalLog as BaseAllocator hasn't fully initialized yet",
