Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome output sinks have a flush() method separate from write(...). Rather than flushing all writes, we can leave this up to the implementation, and have a default no-op Flush implementation. This came up during ARROW-404 (ran into test failure with unflushed writes, because the Java HDFS client does not auto-flush)",
