Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFound ut `TEST_F(TestTakeKernelWithUnion, DISABLED_TakeUnion)` and `TEST_F(TestFilterKernelWithUnion, DISABLED_FilterUnion)` from `vector_selection_test.cc`.\r\n\r\nEnabled and ran.
