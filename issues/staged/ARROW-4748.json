Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe logic to build the group by keys is row-based, performing an array downcast on every single group by value. This could be done in a columnar way instead.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI also wonder if it is possible to avoid converting the result map to an array of map entries.",
