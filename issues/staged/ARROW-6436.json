Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nClang and GCC provide _Float16 and there are numerous polyfills which can emulate a 16 bit float for other platforms. This would fill a hole in the kernels and other code which don't currently support HALF_FLOAT.",

These types are supported in all language modes.\n> \n> `__fp16` is supported on every target, as it is purely a storage format; see below. `_Float16` is currently only supported on the following targets, with further targets pending ABI standardization:\n> - 32-bit ARM\n> - 64-bit ARM (AArch64)\n> - SPIR"
