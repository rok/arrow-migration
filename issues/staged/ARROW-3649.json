Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `MutableBuffer#resize` adjust the buffer's capacity. This is slightly confusing, and is not conforming with Rust's\u00a0as [vector](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.resize), as well as C++'s buffer impl. \r\n\r\nThis proposes to rename the `resize` to `reserve`, and modify the current `set_len` to `resize`. We'll also allow `resize` to shrink the buffer so as to free up unnecessary space.",
