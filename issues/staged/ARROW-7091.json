Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere's no particular reason why parameter-less factories are in `type_fwd.h`, but the others in their respective implementation headers. By putting more factories in `type_fwd.h`, we may be able to avoid importing the heavier headers in some places.",
