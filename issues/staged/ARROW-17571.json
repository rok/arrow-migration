        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17571](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17571). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter a benchmark regression was identified in the [Python refactoring PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13311) we identified the cause is in the build script for benchmarks. In the file _dev/conbench_envs/hooks.sh_ the script used to build PyArrow is _ci/scripts/python_build.sh_ where the default for PyArrow build type is set to **debug** (assuming _CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE_ isn't defined)\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/74dae618ed8d6b492bf3b88e3b9b7dfd4c21e8d8/dev/conbench_envs/hooks.sh#L60-L62>\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/93b63e8f3b4880927ccbd5522c967df79e926cda/ci/scripts/python_build.sh#L55>\u00a0\r\n\r\nI think we need to change the build type to release in _dev/conbench_envs/hooks.sh_ (_build_arrow_python()_) or maybe better to set the variable _CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE_ to release in _dev/conbench_envs/benchmarks.env_.",
