Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-16510, we turned on ARROW_GCS in the autobrew formula, but it's building it bundled in the arrow build. It would be more efficient if we added dependencies (or google-cloud-cpp even) upstream to the autobrew repositories and then used them like we do for aws-sdk-cpp and other dependencies.",
