Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI use toolchain directories that are found outside of conda environments. It's a bit awkward to use archery to do benchmark comparisons with this arrangement. I suggest adding a \"--cpp-package-prefix\" option or similar that will set `ARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=SYSTEM` and the correct `ARROW_PACKAGE_PREFIX` so this works properly",
