Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, we have a differently named set of methods which do the same thing underneath but written inside the concrete implementations of Arrays. One example is append_value in DictionaryArray. Unify these methods with primitive arrays to prevent passing around dynamic objects.",
