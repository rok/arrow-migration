        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11882](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11882). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~jorgecarleitao]` offered a great way to improve the Debug/Display implementations for various Array implementations on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9624#issuecomment-790976766 \r\n\r\nThe only reason we are implementing to_isize/to_usize on NativeType is because we have a function to represent an array (for Display) that accepts a generic physical type T, and then tries to convert it to a isize depending on a logical type (DataType::Date). However, there is already a Many to one relationship between logical and physical types.\r\n\r\nThus, a solution for this is to have the `Debug` function branch off depending on the (logical) datatype, implementing the custom string representation depending on it, instead of having a loop of native type T and then branching off according to the DataType inside the loop.\r\n\r\nI.e. instead of\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nfor i in ... {\r\n   match data_type {\r\n         DataType::Date32 => represent array[i] as date\r\n         DataType::Int32 => represent array[i] as int\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nimo we should have\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nmatch data_type {\r\n     DataType::Date32 => for i in ... {represent array[i] as date}\r\n     DataType::Int32 => for i in ... {represent array[i] as int}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. treat the Display as any other \"kernel\", where behavior is logical, not physical, type-dependent.",
