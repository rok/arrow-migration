I've tried replicating this in Firefox and Chrome on Linux, but cannot.  It appears as if the browser is caching the HTML from the header, or the JS is loading too quickly, and so version 5 is selected even though (I think) the docs displayed relate to version 7.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if it's the usage of `$( document ).ready()` here - perhaps instead, `$( window ).on( \"load\", function() { ... })` may be better - see https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/"
