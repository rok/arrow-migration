Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current JSON parser benchmark suite is fairly limited, as it only really tests objects with a couple non-varying fields. To properly measure optimizations based on input predictability (i.e. [ARROW-4709](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4709)) it would be beneficial to provide a parameterized way to create schemas with an arbitrary number of fields and add benchmarks for input with randomly ordered/omitted fields.",
