Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI get the following CMake warning, which doesn't seem to affect the build:\r\n```Java\n\r\nCMake Warning (dev) at /home/antoine/miniconda3/envs/pyarrow/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):\r\n  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)\r\n  does not match the name of the calling package (Arrow).  This can lead to\r\n  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables\r\n  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  /home/antoine/miniconda3/envs/pyarrow/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:99 (find_package_handle_standard_args)\r\n  cmake_modules/FindArrow.cmake:39 (include)\r\n  cmake_modules/FindArrowPython.cmake:46 (find_package)\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:231 (find_package)\r\nThis warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
