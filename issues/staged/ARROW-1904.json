        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1904](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1904). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI ran into an odd issue where, even though I was casting to `arrow::PrimitiveArray`, it picked up the `raw_values` method from a subclass of `PrimitiveArray` (which includes a slice offset)\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n(gdb) p reinterpret_cast<const int64_t*>(reinterpret_cast<const PrimitiveArray&>(arr).raw_values())[0]\r\n$9 = 25\r\n(gdb) p reinterpret_cast<const int64_t*>(reinterpret_cast<const PrimitiveArray&>(arr).raw_values_)[0]\r\n$10 = 10\r\n(gdb) p arr.offset()\r\n$11 = 15\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the `raw_values` method in PrimitiveArray should be deprecated and removed, since it is dangerous to use as it does not include a slice offset, if any",
