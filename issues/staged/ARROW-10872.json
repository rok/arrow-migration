        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10872](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10872). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's not possible to open a ``abfs://`` or `abfss://` URI with the pyarrow.fs.HadoopFileSystem.\r\n\r\nUsing\u00a0HadoopFileSystem.from_uri(path) does not work and libhdfs will throw an error saying that the authority is invalid (I checked that this is because the string is empty).\r\n\r\nNote that the legacy pyarrow.hdfs.HadoopFileSystem interface works by doing for example:\r\n \\* pyarrow.hdfs.HadoopFileSystem(host=\"abfs://xxx@xxx.dfs.core.windows.net\")\r\n \\* pyarrow.hdfs.connect(host=\"abfs://xxx@xxx.dfs.core.windows.net\")\r\n\r\nand I believe the new interface should work too by passing the full URI as \"host\" to `pyarrow.fs.HadoopFileSystem` constructor. However, the constructor wrongly prepends \"hdfs://\" at the beginning:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/25c736d48dc289f457e74d15d05db65f6d539447/python/pyarrow/_hdfs.pyx#L64>",

But would you be able to try your suggestion yourself, and see it that works for you? A PR would then also be very welcome.\r\n\r\ncc `[~kszucs]`"

(Note, `MiniDFSCluster` is something in the hadoop-hdfs test JAR to let you bring up an HDFS cluster in process purely for testing)"
