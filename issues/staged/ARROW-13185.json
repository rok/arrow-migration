        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13185](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13185). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince modifying the source directory via the build process is generally considered non-optimal, we may want to explore alternative approaches.\u00a0Our preferred approach is to create a single MEX gateway function which delegates to specific C++ functions. This singular MEX function will always be placed in the build tree and added to the MATLAB path.\r\n\r\nAdvantages to this approach:\r\n \\* Better organization\r\n \\*\\* All MEX functions are registered in one location\r\n \\*\\* Reduce the complexity of managing and linking many MEX files and ensuring that they are added to the MATLAB path\r\n \\*\\* Reduce cognitive load for adding a new function\r\n \\* Avoid polluting the source tree with build artifacts\r\n \\* Reduce build times, building a single MEX function is faster than building potentially hundreds\r\n \\* Reduce binary bloat caused by creating a separate MEX file for every MEX function\r\n \\* Enable flexibility in terms of where C++ implementation files live\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
