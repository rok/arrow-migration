Has this been seen before? Is there a known solution? I experienced the same issue installing the pyarrow nightlies as well.",

Just signed up and wanted to say that I came across the same problem with some internal dataset. I can confirm that I get the same result executing the code from the description. I'm running this on an Intel i7-2600K on Windows 10 Enterprise Version 2004 with the latest 2.0 pyarrow release on Python v3.8.1. Do you need anything more?\r\n\r\n**Update** Weird,\u00a0[this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47787530/6453903) fixed it for me. I uninstalled my base python and deleted my IDEA venv, installed python again and created my venv from my requirements anew. working. no idea whatsoever was wrong nor what actually fixed it."

It somehow seems to be related to snappy compression, as it works fine when using gzip as the compression.\r\n\r\n**Update:** Running the same code on the same machine inside of WSL works just fine."
