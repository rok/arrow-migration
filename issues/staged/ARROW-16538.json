        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16538](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16538). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe existing FakeResultSet used in tests of the JDBC adapter is challenging to use to build arbitrary ResultSets - such as would be useful in dealing with issues like ARROW-16427.\u00a0 Converting this to a more generic utility to build mock ResultSets would enable testing of JDBC vendor-specific behavior that is discovered, without actually referencing those drivers within test code.\u00a0 Finally, it would be useful to more such a utility to a general class, leaving just the test code in the existing test class.",
