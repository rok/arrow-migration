Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOne way or the other, we should try to sanitize local filesystem paths on Windows, by converting backslashes into regular slahes.\r\n\r\nOne place to do it is `FileSystemFromUri`. One complication is that \\-separated paths can fail parsing as a URI, but we only want to sanitize a path if we detected it's a local path (by parsing the URI). Perhaps trying on error would work.",

Back then it was decided that it wasn't C++'s responsibility to sanitize file paths. Happy to remove the R code that patch added if we reach a different decision this time."
