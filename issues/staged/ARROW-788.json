Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Ray nondeterminism tests are failing on\nhttps://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/436 (moving to Arrow's Tensor serialization code).\n\nThis might mean that there is some nondeterminism (like uninitialized memory) in the IPC file written by the Arrow Tensor serializer. I'm investigating it now, please let me know if you have an idea what the problem could be.",

Couple ideas:\n\n- The amount of padding in the metadata header depends on the starting byte offset. The `WriteTensor` code does not guarantee to write a multiple of 8 bytes, but we could fix this\n- Is it possible any of your arrays are not contiguous? e.g. you had before https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/436/files#diff-17aeecc6d41bcd220496c0d5211cf58fL80 \u2013 we aren't checking in WriteTensor whether the data is contiguous, but we probably should (ARROW-794)"

It seems to be fixed by the first idea, this patch makes the nondeterminism tests pass: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/512\n\nLet me know if you can think of reasonable tests for this in arrow or if documentation needs to be updated!"
