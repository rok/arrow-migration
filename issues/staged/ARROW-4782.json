Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am beginning to develop a C++ API for describing analytical expressions on scalars, arrays, and tables in the general style of Ibis (https://docs.ibis-project.org/sql.html) which has been used to successfully model SQL relational algebra as well as a broader variety of analytical operations.
