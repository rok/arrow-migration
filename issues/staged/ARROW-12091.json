        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12091](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12091). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now `Executor::Transfer` isn't perfectly reliable since callbacks added after the future has been completed will be run synchronously and so the thread task would be spawned at the wrong time.\u00a0 With this feature `Executor::Transfer` could be fixed.\r\n\r\nThis would need to be added to both `Then` and `AddCallback`.\r\n\r\nIdeally the methods would detect if the current thread is already on the desired executor and do nothing in that situation.\u00a0 Spinning up unnecessary thread tasks would do more harm than good.",
