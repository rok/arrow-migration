Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be nice if we had some confidence that our next major release runs on Apple Silicon. I am looking at hooking up an M1 Mac Mini to Buildkite so that we are able to run CI jobs on one. If anyone else would like to contribute a machine to the build cluster, please be our guest",
