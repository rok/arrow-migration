Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTensorFlow has the notion of a ReadOnlyMappedRegion\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system.h#L106\r\n\r\nRather than toggling memory mapping globally at the LocalFilesystem level, it would be useful for code to be able to request a memory-mapped {[RandomAccessFile}} if memory mapping is possible\r\n\r\nSee also ARROW-7854",
