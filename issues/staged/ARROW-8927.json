        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8927](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8927). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the cuda IPC calls for `ReadRecordBatch` do not accept a dictionary memo as a parameter, building an empty memo before calling `ipc::ReadRecordBatch`. As such, adding a test which duplicates\u00a0`TestCudaArrowIpc, BasicWriteRead` but calls `MakeDictionary` to create the record batch fails because the dictionaries for the original record batch are not found. The cuda IPC calls should be modified to take a dictionary memo, just like the standard IPC API.",
