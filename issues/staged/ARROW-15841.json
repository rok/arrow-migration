        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15841](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15841). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-9235 we have a problem where we need to evaluate code (may be C++ that calls the R API in a way that may allocate R memory or literal R code) on the R main thread. As discussed in the pull request ( https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12323#issuecomment-1054726309 ), there are other times that this has come up and will come up in the future (e.g., evaluating user-defined R functions from the query engine, implementing extension types from R).\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with `[~westonpace]`, it seems like it is worth investing in a `SafeCallFromR()` C++ function that lives in the R bindings. The initial approach (that may need to be altered as we go) will be to\r\n\r\n- have a global object that is initialized at the beginning of a C++ call from R to specific functions (and released on exit) that maintains some list of tasks that need to run on the R main thread and an event loop to periodically evaluate them while background tasks are running.\n- define a `SafeCallFromR()` C++ function that adds a task to the global object and waits for the result to come back.\n  \n  (with apologies to Weston if I mischaracterized our conversation!)",
