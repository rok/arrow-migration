Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo wire the brew installed version to the downstream project I used the following snippet.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nfind_package(Arrow CONFIG REQUIRED) \r\nfind_package(Parquet CONFIG REQUIRED PATHS /usr/local/lib/cmake/arrow NO_DEFAULT_PATH) target_link_libraries(database PRIVATE arrow_shared parquet_shared) \u00a0\r\n```\r\nNot sure if this is the right way. None of the examples given on the docs show a good example of cmake for using parquet in a downstream project.",
