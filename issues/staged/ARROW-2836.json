Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCreate release tags for each task instead a single one for the job, and create additional tasks per build variant. \r\nThis will resolve the package naming conflicts, but increases the config verbosity (which is fine for now).",
