        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16678](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16678). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTrying to install Arrow 8.0 in R in the following way compiles successfully but fails to load:\r\n```java\n\r\nSys.setenv(\"NOT_CRAN\" = TRUE)\r\ninstall.packages(\"arrow\") \n```\r\nOutput at failure:\r\n```java\n\r\ninstalling to /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/00LOCK-arrow/00new/arrow/libs\r\n** R\r\n** inst\r\n** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading\r\n** help\r\n*** installing help indices\r\n** building package indices\r\n** installing vignettes\r\n** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location\r\nError: package or namespace load failed for \u2018arrow\u2019 in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):\r\n\u00a0unable to load shared object '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/00LOCK-arrow/00new/arrow/libs/arrow.so':\r\n\u00a0 /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/00LOCK-arrow/00new/arrow/libs/arrow.so: undefined symbol: EVP_MD_size\r\nError: loading failed \n```\r\nThis is a freshly created Ubuntu 22.04 instance created on AWS.\r\n\r\nLooks like EVP_MD_size may be related to openssl. The libssl3, libssl-dev, and libcrypt-dev apt packages are all installed.\r\n\r\nAlternate methods to install Arrow seem to succeed. In particular, this worked:\r\ninstall.packages(\"arrow\", repos = \"https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/__linux__/jammy/latest\")\r\nSo, I'm not sure how serious the issue is, but it's notable since the failing method above is the recommended way to install the package.\r\n\r\n``",

RSPM works because they compiled on 22.04.\r\n\r\nWe will need to add a separate 22.04 binary.\r\n\r\ncc\u00a0 `[~npr]`"
