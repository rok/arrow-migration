Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe workaround\u00a0ARROW-2657\u00a0should be optimized a little bit and use the loading of\u00a0libtensorflow_framework.so (instead of doing a full \"import tensorflow\") also for Python 2.7.\r\n\r\nWe are running into this, since doing \"import tensorflow\" spawns a number of threads, so without this optimization, using many python processes with pyarrow will hit OS limits for threads.",
