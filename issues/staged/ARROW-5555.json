Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowing\u00a0ARROW-5488, it will be possible to install the R package without having libarrow installed, but you won't be able to do anything until you do. The error message you get when trying to use the package directs you to call `install_arrow()`.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis function will at a minimum give a recommendation of steps to take to install the library. In some cases, we may be able to download and install it for the user.",
