Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the integration test JSON format assumes that dictionaries remain constant throughout the stream. It might be better to change the JSON format to more closely mimic the IPC protocol (a sequence of messages tagged with the message type)\r\n\r\nfollow on to ARROW-3144",
