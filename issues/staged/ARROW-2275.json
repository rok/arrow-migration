Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor immutable buffers (i.e. most of them), the `mutable_data_` member is uninitialized. If the user calls `mutable_data()` by mistake on such a buffer, they will get a bogus pointer back.\r\n\r\nThis is exacerbated by the Tensor API whose const and non-const `raw_data()` methods return different things...\r\n\r\n(also an idea: add a DCHECK for mutability before returning from `mutable_data()`?)",
