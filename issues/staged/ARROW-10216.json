Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUsing a similar approach as the sum kernel (ARROW-10015). Instead of initializing the accumulator with 0 we'd need the largest/smallest possible value for each ArrowNumericType (i.e. u64::MAX or +-Inf)\r\n\r\nPseudo code for min aggregation\u00a0\r\n```Java\n\r\n// initialize accumulator\r\nmin_acc = +Inf\r\n// aggregate each chunk\r\nmin_acc = min(min_acc, select(valid, value, +Inf))\r\n```",
