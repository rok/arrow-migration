        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1749](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1749). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`2 ** 127 - 1` and `-2 ** 127` both require a 39th digit to be displayed as a decimal string.\r\n\r\nThis means we do not have the ability to _display_ decimal values above `10 ** 38 - 1` even though we have the ability to _store_ them.\r\n\r\nFor reference, Impala returns `NULL` when trying to cast `2 ** 127 - 1` to `DECIMAL(38, 0)`.\r\n\r\nA few next steps are in order:\r\n\r\n1. Explicitly test this behavior\n1. Avoid crashing or displaying garbage when we cannot display a number that can be stored\n1. Make a decision about whether we want to eventually support range of values from `10 ** 38` to `2 ** 127 - 1` positive and `-2 ** 127` to `-10 ** 38` negative. This would require a larger integer type to hold the value just before being converted to a string.",
