Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ngo1.18 added a \"-asan\" build option to leverage an equivalent to Address Sanitizer in C++. Currently we only build the Go code and run tests using go1.16 which does not have the \"-asan\" option.\r\n\r\nSince we want to maintain the backwards compatibility and not yet upgrade to go1.18, we should create a new job that runs the tests using go1.18 and the \"-asan\" option to perform additional safety checking.",
