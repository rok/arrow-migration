        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16777](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16777). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRelated to ARROW-16776 but after a brief discussion with Neal Richardson, he requested that I split the improvement request into separate issues.\r\n\r\nWhen working with Arrow datasets/tables, I often find myself wanting to interactively print or \"see\" the results of a query or the first few rows of the data without having to fully collect into memory. \r\n\r\nIt would be ideal to lazily print some data with Table/RecordBatch print methods, however, currently, the print methods return schema without data. \r\n\r\nIE:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\n\r\nmtcars %>% arrow::write_parquet(\"mtcars.parquet\")\r\ncar_ds <- arrow::open_dataset(\"mtcars.parquet\")\r\n\r\ncar_ds\r\n#> FileSystemDataset with 1 Parquet file\r\n#> mpg: double\r\n#> cyl: double\r\n#> disp: double\r\n#> hp: double\r\n#> drat: double\r\n#> wt: double\r\n#> qsec: double\r\n#> vs: double\r\n#> am: double\r\n#> gear: double\r\n#> carb: double\r\n#> \r\n#> See $metadata for additional Schema metadata\r\n\r\ncar_ds %>%\r\n  compute()\r\n#> Table\r\n#> 32 rows x 11 columns\r\n#> $mpg <double>\r\n#> $cyl <double>\r\n#> $disp <double>\r\n#> $hp <double>\r\n#> $drat <double>\r\n#> $wt <double>\r\n#> $qsec <double>\r\n#> $vs <double>\r\n#> $am <double>\r\n#> $gear <double>\r\n#> $carb <double>\r\n#> \r\n#> See $metadata for additional Schema metadata\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

It's also, I believe, along the lines of what dbplyr does for printing.\r\n\r\nWhoever does the implementing I'm sure will be aware of this, but if the input to the query is a RecordBatchReader we have to be careful **not** to consume any record batches (i.e., probably just print an empty tibble)."
