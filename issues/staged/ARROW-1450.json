        "title": "[Python] Raise proper error if custom serialization handler fails",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1450](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1450). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, the following fails:\n\n```none\ndef test_serializaton_callback_error():\n\n    class TempClass(object):\n            pass\n\n# Have a SerializationContext but TempClass is not\n# registered\n\n    serialization_context = pa.SerializationContext()\n\n    with pytest.raises(pa.SerializationCallbackError):\n        serialized_object = pa.serialize(TempClass, serialization_context)\n```\n\nThis is because serialize will raise a generic ArrowException instead of a SerializationCallbackError. We do need the latter because it contains the object that couldn't be serialized, which is important to give good error messages; in the case of Ray we sometimes want use the object to register additional serialization callbacks on the fly to make the user experience smoother.",
