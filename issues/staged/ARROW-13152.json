Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a plasma client issues a Get request containing duplicate object IDs, and a timeout of -1, the server will hang.\r\n\r\nThe logic at the end of `PlasmaStore::ProcessGetRequest()` only returns a response when the number of satisfied requests match the number of **unique** objects to wait for.\u00a0 The former is calculated using the number of requested object IDs, not the number of unique requested object IDs.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n# start the plasma store first\r\n\r\nfrom pyarrow import plasma\r\nclient = plasma.connect(\"/tmp/plasma\")\r\noid = client.put(\"hello, world\")\r\nprint(client.get([oid, oid], -1))print(\"done.\")\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",
