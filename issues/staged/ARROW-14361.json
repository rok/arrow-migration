        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14361](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14361). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to enable `ARROW_HAVE_NEON` CMake flag on ARM architectures `ARROW_SIMD_LEVEL` option must be set to not `\"NONE\"`, see https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L444\r\n\r\nThe default value for `ARROW_SIMD_LEVEL` is `SSE4_2` which is a bit misleading on ARM64, it should rather be `NEON` which is not listed as a valid option for `ARROW_SIMD_LEVEL`. We may have a `\"MAX\"` default value similarly to the  `ARROW_RUNTIME_SIMD_LEVEL` option, see https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/DefineOptions.cmake#L115\r\n\r\nOriginal github comment: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11433#discussion_r729852835\r\n\r\ncc `[~yibocai]` `[~apitrou]`",
