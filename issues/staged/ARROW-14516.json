Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncc `[~Jayjeet]`\r\nARROW-13607 enabled privileged mode for ubuntu-cpp docker builds, which prevents usage of userns remapping. We should disable privileged mode.\r\n\r\nPrivilege mode was required to mount cephfs, which, according to the Fuse docs here: https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephfs/mount-using-fuse/, should be possible as non-root.",
