Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable to have the ability to obtain a data frame with the unique combinations, say\r\n```r\n\r\nopen_dataset(\"sitc-rev2/parquet/\",\r\n             partitioning = c(\"Year\", \"Trade Flow\", \"Reporter ISO\")) %>%\r\n  select(Year, `Reporter ISO`) %>%\r\n  filter(Year >= 1988 & Year <= 1994) %>% \r\n  distinct() %>% \r\n  collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the current development version of the Arrow package (installed from GitHub), we get this error for the last expression\r\n```r\n\r\nError in UseMethod(\"distinct\") : \r\n  no applicable method for 'distinct' applied to an object of class \"arrow_dplyr_query\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works\r\n```r\n\r\nreporters_1 <- open_dataset(\"sitc-rev2/parquet/\",\r\n             partitioning = c(\"Year\", \"Trade Flow\", \"Reporter ISO\")) %>%\r\n  select(Year, `Reporter ISO`) %>%\r\n  filter(Year >= 1988 & Year <= 1994) %>% \r\n  collect() %>% \r\n  distinct()\r\n```\r\n",
