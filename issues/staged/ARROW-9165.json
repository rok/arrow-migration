Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-295 added a DOAP file so that Arrow could be listed at https://projects.apache.org/. Unfortunately, the next step of registering it in https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/projects.apache.org/trunk/data/projects.xml never happened, so we're still not in the list.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this file is not maintained, so it still lists the current Arrow version as 0.12.0.",
