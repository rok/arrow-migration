        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17919](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17919). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn several places in the Java codebase you can see this kind of pattern:\r\n```java\n\r\n    while (vector.getDataBuffer().capacity() < toCapacity) {\r\n      vector.reallocDataBuffer();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the event that a much larger capacity is requested, this will spuriously make several reallocations (doubling the capacity each time).\r\n\r\nIt would probably be more efficient to reallocate directly to satisfy the desired capacity.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, there's a `reallocDataBuffer` overload that seems to do just that.",
