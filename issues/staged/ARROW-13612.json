        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13612). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a follow-up on ARROW-13541 (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10904#discussion_r686609844), we could have a mechanism that the ExtensionType can control the behaviour of `ExtensionScalar.as_py()` method.\r\n\r\nSimilarly as we have `\\_\\_arrow_ext_class\\_\\_` for using an ExtensionArray subclass for the array object, we could indeed have a way to specify a custom scalar wrapper.",
