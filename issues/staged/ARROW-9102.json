Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHowever the secrets were set on azure pipelines the upload step is failing: \r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/ursa-labs/crossbow/_build/results?buildId=13104&view=logs&j=0da5d1d9-276d-5173-c4c4-9d4d4ed14fdb&t=d9b15392-e4ce-5e4c-0c8c-b69645229181\r\n\r\nSo the manylinux builds take more than two hours. This is due to azure's secret handling, we need to explicitly export the azure secret variables as environment variables.",
