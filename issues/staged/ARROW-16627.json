Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOriginated as part of the [review](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13196#discussion_r878229869) for the ARROW-16407 [PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13196). \r\n\r\nCurrently we get a surprising output when parsing of `%Y-%m` strings such as `\"2020-01\"` - see reprex below.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(arrow, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\r\n\r\ncall_function(\r\n  \"strptime\",\r\n  Array$create(\"2020-01\"),\r\n  options = list(\r\n    format = \"%Y-%m\",\r\n    unit = 0L\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n#> Array\r\n#> <timestamp[s]>\r\n#> [\r\n#>   2019-12-31 00:00:00\r\n#> ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this would be useful somewhere else, but we could definitely use this to remove some workarounds in the R bindings.
