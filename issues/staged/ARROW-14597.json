Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi All,\r\n\r\nI am having difficutly installing r-arrow with snappy compression on github action. I have set environment variable `ARROW_WITH_SNAPPY: ON` (<https://github.com/DyfanJones/noctua/blob/0079bf997737516fd3e1b61dbde7510044f79a2f/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml> ). However I get the following error in my unit tests:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nError: Error: NotImplemented: Support for codec 'snappy' not built\r\n    In order to read this file, you will need to reinstall arrow with additional features enabled.\r\n    Set one of these environment variables before installing:\r\n     * LIBARROW_MINIMAL=false (for all optional features, including 'snappy')  \r\n     * ARROW_WITH_SNAPPY=ON (for just 'snappy')\r\n\r\n    See https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html for detail\n```\r\n\r\narrow version: 6.0.0.2\r\n\r\nMy PR <https://github.com/DyfanJones/noctua/pull/169> with the github actions issue.\r\n\r\nAny advice is much appericated.",

There's been some small turbulence with binary installations of Arrow. And those coming from RSPM specifically: the binaries exist but don't include snappy or a handful of other optional compression libraries. We are working with them to resolve this so it should just work again in the future (we also will be releasing a patch release shortly which should push this out a bit quicker).\r\n\r\nYou can tell that you're getting the packages from RSPM by [looking at the URL where the package is downloaded from](https://github.com/DyfanJones/noctua/runs/4045701651?check_suite_focus=true#step:5:24) and then a few lines later you'll see it say it's a binary package.\r\n\r\nFor now, there are a few options:\r\n\r\n- You can set the environment variables you did (e.g. `LIBARROW_MINIMAL=false` [1]) and also set the repo to use a URL that hosts source packages (any CRAN mirror or the RSPM source url would be just fine here) [when you do your temp install](https://github.com/DyfanJones/noctua/pull/169/commits/70fd58acc19883592e715be94d7002c062541b46#diff-9c940e8ad2b7bc4c26ec3da57b94bc00e73e2166cfed689da51a4c59bcc0a310R41)\n- You could also wait a few more days for this to be resolved \u2014 we've chatted with RSPM and they should be updating their binaries soon, and like I said we have a patch release on its way through the release process so should be released sometime next week which should also resolve this.\n  \n  Sorry for the turbulence here, we know it's a pain when something that was working suddenly stops.\n  \n  [1] You can set `NOT_CRAN=true` which is our more general flag during installation that does a few other niceties like enables a non-minimal build but also will attempt to use the binaries that we host."
