        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1533](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1533). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe recently encountered a problem when we were trying to add JSON files with complex schema as datasets.\n\nInitially we started with a Float8Vector with default memory allocation of (4096 \\* 8) 32KB.\nWent through several iterations of setSafe() to trigger a realloc() from 32KB to 64KB.\nAnother round of setSafe() calls to trigger a realloc() from 64KB to 128KB\n\nAfter that we encountered a BigInt and promoted our vector to UnionVector.\n\nThis required us to create a UnionVector with BigIntVector and Float8Vector. The latter required us to transfer the Float8Vector we were earlier working with to the Float8Vector inside the Union.\n\nAs part of transferTo(), the target Float8Vector got all the ArrowBuf state (capacity, buffer contents) etc transferred from the source vector.\n\nLater, a realloc was triggered on the Float8Vector inside the UnionVector.\n\nThe computation inside realloc() to determine the amount of memory to be reallocated goes wrong since it makes the decision based on allocateSizeInBytes \u2013 although this vector was created as part of transfer() from 128KB source vector, allocateSizeInBytes is still at the initial/default value of 32KB\n\nWe end up allocating a 64KB buffer and attempt to copy 128KB over 64KB and seg fault when invoking setBytes().\n\nThere is a wrong assumption in realloc() that allocateSizeInBytes is always equal to data.capacity(). The particular scenario described above exposes where this assumption could go wrong.",
