Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nStarting from big array sizes (~500Mb) `pyarrow.array` constructor hangs and starts to consume memory until it's killed (by hand or by OOM).\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nmy_string = 'a' * 40\r\nstrings = [my_string for _ in range(100_000_000)]\r\npyarrow_array = pa.array(x[:50_000_000]) # this works a couple of seconds\r\npyarrow_array = pa.array(x[:60_000_000]) # this hangs and consumes all free memory\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn pyarrow==3.0.0 it works seamlessly.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
