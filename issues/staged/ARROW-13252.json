        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13252](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13252). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCSV parsing error messages will contain the row number when parallel parsing is not enabled but when parallel parsing is enabled there is no indication of where the error occurred in the input. In order to add that context the row byte offset can be added to the output.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis can be done relatively easily for the parser but associating byte offsets with the data or row being decoded would require more metadata to be maintained in the DataBatch. Potentially doubling the size of ParsedValueDesc.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis was mentioned and discussed in comments [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10202#issuecomment-870796708)",
