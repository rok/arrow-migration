I have some colleagues working at ucx as core maintainers. Actually, the idea of integrating ucx into flightrpc is from [Pavel Shamis](https://github.com/shamisp) in an internal tech meeting. Ping me if you met with some difficulties in ucx and need help. I think Pavel will be okay to give some support (unfortunately I have little knowledge about ucx)."
