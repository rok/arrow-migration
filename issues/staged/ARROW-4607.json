Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to package Arrow, it needs to be possible to use only external dependencies, because the package builder isn't allowed to download any files during build form security reasons, so bundling isn't possible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI am not saying that the build should be radically changed, it should only have a particular cmake variable (ex. ````USE_EXTERNAL_PACKAGES````) that would make it to use only external packages.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy particular OS is FreeBSD, but this concern should apply to all systems.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnother relevant discussion is here: <https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/56e3e5e44901a4ff4f62adc93bb0d34d4c4eac48c993146172e7684e@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
