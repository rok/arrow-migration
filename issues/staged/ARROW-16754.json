I can add more test cases for CONFLICT_REPLACE.\r\n\r\nBy the way I believe in future may be we can deprecate the \"addOrGet()\" API <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/8e43f23dcc6a9e630516228f110c48b64d13cec6/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/complex/AbstractStructVector.java#L148-L174>, which seems to overlap the functionality of `CONFLICT_IGNORE`."
