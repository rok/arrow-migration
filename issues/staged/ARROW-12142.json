Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUsing Ubuntu 20.04 in Github Actions CI to test a python extension that integrates with MongoDB and pyarrow, I get this error when attempting to import the Cython+pyarrow extension module:\r\n```python\n\r\nImportError: Failed to import test module: test_arrow\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.8/unittest/loader.py\", line 436, in _find_test_path\r\n    module = self._get_module_from_name(name)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.8/unittest/loader.py\", line 377, in _get_module_from_name\r\n    __import__(name)\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/mongo-arrow/mongo-arrow/bindings/python/test/test_arrow.py\", line 21, in <module>\r\n    from pymongoarrow.api import aggregate_arrow_all, find_arrow_all, Schema\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/mongo-arrow/mongo-arrow/bindings/python/pymongoarrow/__init__.py\", line 18, in <module>\r\n    from pymongoarrow.lib import libbson_version\r\nImportError: /home/runner/work/mongo-arrow/mongo-arrow/bindings/python/pymongoarrow/lib.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5arrow6StatusC1ENS_10StatusCodeERKNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe task installs pyarrow 3.0 from the manylinux2014 wheel:\r\n```Java\n\r\nCollecting pyarrow>=3\r\n  Downloading pyarrow-3.0.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (20.7 MB)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same project works fine locally on macOS (10.15) also using pyarrow 3.0 installed via pip. Upon googling I found this blog: https://uwekorn.com/2019/09/15/how-we-build-apache-arrows-manylinux-wheels.html\r\n\r\nThe article explains that the fix for `\"undefined symbol: _ZN5arrow6StatusC1ENS_10StatusCodeERKNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE\"` is to add `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` to CFLAGS which did work for me. However, the article says this is only needed for manylinux1 wheels because they build on an old platform. Is it expected that users still need to define this flag when using manylinux2014 wheels?",
