        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16719](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16719). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently you can pass a local file path or file-like object, or a URI (eg \"s3://...\") or path+filesystem combo to `parquet.read_table`. \r\nBut the `parquet.read_metadata` and `parquet.read_schema` methods (being a small wrapper around `ParquetFile` only accept the local file path or file-like object. I would propose to add the same path+filesystem handling to those functions as happens in `read_table` to make the capabilities of those consistent.\r\n\r\n(I ran into this in geopandas, where we use `read_table` to read the actual data, but also need `read_metadata` to inspect the actual Parquet FileMetaData for metadata)",
