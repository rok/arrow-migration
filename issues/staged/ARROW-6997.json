Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe need symbolic links to `${VERSION}Server` from `${VERSION`} such as `7Server` from `7`. (Is it available on BinTray?)\r\n\r\nWe also need to update install information. We can't install `epel-release` by `yum install -y epel-release`. We need to specify URL explicitly: `yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`. See https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL for details.",
