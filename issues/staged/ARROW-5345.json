Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollow up to ARROW-3144\r\n\r\nCurrently we associate dictionaries with a hash table mapping a Field's memory address to a dictionary id. This poses an issue if two RecordBatches are equal (equal field names, equal types) but were instantiated separately. We don't have a hash function in C++ for Field so we should consider implementing one and using that instead (if it is not too expensive) so that same but \"different\" (different C++ objects) won't blow up in the user's face with an unintuitive error (this did in fact occur once in the Python test suite, not sure exactly why it wasn't a problem before, I think it worked \"by accident\")",
