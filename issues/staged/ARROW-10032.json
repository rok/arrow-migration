Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\"Replicating AppVeyor Builds\" needs the following changes: <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/windows.html#replicating-appveyor-builds>\r\n \\* The recommended VM does not include the C++ compiler - we should link to the build tools and describe which of them needs installation\r\n \\* Boost: the b2 script now requires --with not -with flags\r\n \\* The batch script were renamed (appveyor-cpp-build/appveyor-cpp-setup)\r\n \\* Prefer JOB=Build_Debug as otherwise it forces clcache\r\n \\* BOOST_INCLUDEDIR must be set to C:\\Boost\\include\\boost_VERSION\r\n \\* Use conda manually to install gtest gflags ninja rapidjson grpc-cpp protobuf\r\n\r\nEven with this:\r\n \\* The developer prompt can't find cl.exe (the compiler). (You must restart the VM!)\r\n \\* The PowerShell prompt can't use conda (it complains a config file isn't signed)\r\n Solution: run a PowerShell instance as administrator and run \"Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted\"",
