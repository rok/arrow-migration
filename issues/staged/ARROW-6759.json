Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe JavaScript CI build is taking 25-30 minutes nowadays. This could be abbreviated by testing fewer deployment targets. We obviously still need to test all the deployment targets but we could do that nightly instead of on every commit",

Historically these have the most issues since they're minified, so if they pass everything should pass:\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\nnpm run build -- -m umd -t es5 -t es2015 -t esnext\r\nnpm test -- -m umd -t es5 -t es2015 -t esnext\r\n```\r\n"
