Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, if a user wants to execute an expression, we require them to create an exec plan, add a project node, and then run the exec plan.  However, for simple use cases, where a user already has a record batch in memory, we could probably expose ExecuteScalarExpression on its own.",
