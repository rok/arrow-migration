Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee all the compiler warnings in our Windows builds\n\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/build/1.0.652\n\nAlso, consider the hacks we have around gcc/clang disagreement about visibility about the use of extern template:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/array.h#L508\n\nI suspect we may want some macros to help with compiler differences about such issues, possibly to go in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/util/visibility.h",
