        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14362](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14362). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `arrow::case_when()` has been implemented to work inside an `arrow::mutate()` call. As a consequence, this chunk of code errors:\r\n```r\n\r\narrow_vec <- Array$create(c(1:3, 5:8))\r\ncase_when(arrow_vec < 4 ~ \"less than 4\", \r\n          TRUE ~ \"greater than 4\")\r\nError: LHS of case 1 (`arrow_vec < 4`) must be a logical vector, not a `Array/ArrowDatum/ArrowObject/R6` object.\r\n```\r\nwhile the equivalent dplyr code works:\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\nnum_vec <- c(1:3, 5:8)\r\ncase_when(\r\n    num_vec < 4 ~ \"less than 4\",\r\n    TRUE ~ \"greater than 4\")\r\n[1] \"less than 4\"    \"less than 4\"    \"less than 4\"    \"greater than 4\"\r\n[5] \"greater than 4\" \"greater than 4\" \"greater than 4\"\r\n```\r\nThis is related to ARROW-13799.",

I.e. that arrow::case_when() only works in a mutate context. From a user's perspective they might expect dplyr::case_when() and arrow::case_when() to be identical. Quite a bunch of the examples in the [dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html) use case_when standalone (outside a mutate() call)."
