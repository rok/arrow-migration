Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`TestBufferedRowGroupWriter` declares a variable named `PAGE_SIZE`. This clashes with a macro constant by the same name defined in musl's `limits.h`.\r\n\r\nI don't think using ALLCAPS for a local name adds value here, so I'm going to change it to `page_size`.",
