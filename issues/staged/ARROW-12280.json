Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen someone @-mentions someone in their PR description, it triggers spam e-mails in GitHub's system to all the mentioned people each time someone synchronizes their fork. For example, this commit triggered an e-mail to me\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bkietz/arrow/commit/b2fa55db273d44b14814d45dae8525b065e01a91\r\n\r\nIt would be fairly each to sanitize @-mentions to simply strip the @-symbol, with the right regular expression of course (since the characters after the @ symbol can include hyphens or underscores, but otherwise any ASCII alphanumeric character)",
