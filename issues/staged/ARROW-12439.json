        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12439](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12439). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf the intermediate data is already partitioned on a certain expression (key), the repartition doesn't have to be added (in a join), or should be removed in an optimization rule. This will avoid having to repartition (and maybe shuffle in Ballista).",
