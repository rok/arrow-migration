Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`arrow::compute::ExecBatch` uses a vector of `arrow::Datum` to contain a collection of ArrayData and Scalar objects for kernel execution. It would be helpful to know how many nanoseconds of overhead is associated with basic interactions with this data structure to know the cost of using our vendored variant, and other such issues. ",
