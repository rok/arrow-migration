        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9007](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9007). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-9005 introduces a concat kernel which allows for concatenating multiple arrays of the same type into a single array. This is useful for sorting on multiple arrays, among other things.\r\n\r\nThe concat kernel is implemented for most array types, but not yet for nested arrays (lists, structs, etc).\r\n\r\nThis Jira is for creating a way of appending/merging all array types, so that concat (and functionality that depends on it) can support all array types.",
