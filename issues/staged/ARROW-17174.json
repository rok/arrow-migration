        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17174](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17174). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUnless this is user error (which it may well be!), it seems that Dataset FilenamePartitioning on read doesn't seem to work with an fsspec filesystem. From what I can glean, the filenames can be parsed successfully when passed to the parse() method, but do not seem to be being extracted as fields from the filenames passed to dataset() \u2013 instead, they appear as nulls. When trying to use the partitioning discover() method (assuming this is a reasonable thing to try), I get the below traceback. (Repro python script attached).\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n\u00a0 File \"/zip_of_csvs_test.py\", line 82, in <module>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ds_partitioned = pds.dataset(\r\n\u00a0 File \"/.pyenv/versions/3.8.2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pyarrow/dataset.py\", line 697, in dataset\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 return _filesystem_dataset(source, \\*\\*kwargs)\r\n\u00a0 File \"/.pyenv/versions/3.8.2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pyarrow/dataset.py\", line 449, in _filesystem_dataset\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 return factory.finish(schema)\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/_dataset.pyx\", line 1857, in pyarrow._dataset.DatasetFactory.finish\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 144, in pyarrow.lib.pyarrow_internal_check_status\r\n\u00a0 File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 100, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: No non-null segments were available for field 'frequency'; couldn't infer type",
