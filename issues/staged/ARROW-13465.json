Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/2054 duckdb will have functionality to emit Arrow tables (and ideally record batches).\r\n\r\nWe should document the workflow (and possibly write thin wrappers around these to make them consistent with other Arrow functions).\r\n\r\nThis might be an opportunity to make a larger `to_arrow()` generic that can take either a duckdb query/table/reference or a pyarrow object (wrapping `py_to_r()`) so there's a unified interface for the purposes of getting arrow data out of known sources.",
