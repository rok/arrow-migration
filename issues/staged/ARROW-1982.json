        "title": "[Python] Return parquet statistics min/max as values instead of strings",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1982](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1982). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `min` and `max` column statistics are returned as formatted strings of the _physical type_. This makes using them in python a bit tricky, as the strings need to be parsed as the proper _logical type_. Observe:\r\n\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [20]: import pandas as pd\r\n\r\nIn [21]: df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3],\r\n    ...:                    'b': ['a', 'b', 'c'],\r\n    ...:                    'c': [pd.Timestamp('1991-01-01')]*3})\r\n    ...:\r\n\r\nIn [22]: df.to_parquet('temp.parquet', engine='pyarrow')\r\n\r\nIn [23]: from pyarrow import parquet as pq\r\n\r\nIn [24]: f = pq.ParquetFile('temp.parquet')\r\n\r\nIn [25]: rg = f.metadata.row_group(0)\r\n\r\nIn [26]: rg.column(0).statistics.min  # string instead of integer\r\nOut[26]: '1'\r\n\r\nIn [27]: rg.column(1).statistics.min  # weird space added after value due to formatter\r\nOut[27]: 'a '\r\n\r\nIn [28]: rg.column(2).statistics.min  # formatted as physical type (int) instead of logical (datetime)\r\nOut[28]: '662688000000'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the type information is known, it should be possible to convert these to arrow values instead of strings.",
