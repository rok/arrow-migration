Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently when `LIBARROW_MINIMAL`\u00a0takes a value other than `false`, the Arrow C++ library is built with mimalloc, S3, and compression algos turned off. Consider whether to turn off some other capabilities when `LIBARROW_MINIMAL`\u00a0is explicitly set to\u00a0`true`, including Arrow Dataset and Parquet.\r\n\r\nThe code that controls this is in\u00a0`r/inst/build_arrow_static.sh`",
