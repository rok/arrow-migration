Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe method\r\n\r\n`org.apache.arrow.algorithm.sort.DefaultVectorComparators#createDefaultComparator`\r\n\r\ndoes not handle vectors that are instances of\u00a0`BaseLargeVariableWidthVector`\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to extend this method to handle this case. It looks like it ought to be easy to define an appropriate comparator class\r\n```java\n\r\nclass LargeVariableWidthComparator extends VectorValueComparator<BaseLargeVariableWidthVector> \n```",
