Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMinor docs improvement suggestion:\r\n\r\nThe docs for `DayOfWeekOptions` say:\u00a0\r\n> `bool one_based_numbering`\n> Number days from 1 if true and from 0 if false.\n> \n> `uint32_t week_start`\n> What day does the week start with (Monday=1, Sunday=7)\r\nThis might confuse some users into thinking that the meaning of `week_start`\u00a0is dependent on the value of\u00a0`one_based_numbering`. For example, some users might think that if they set `one_based_numbering=0`, then `week_start=1`\u00a0will be interpreted to mean Sunday instead of Monday.\r\n\r\nAdd a sentence in the docs explaining that the meaning of number passed to\u00a0`week_start`\u00a0is unaffected by the choice of `one_based_numbering`.",
