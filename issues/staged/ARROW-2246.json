Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBoost provides the functionality to generate a namespaced copy of all its implementations. This means that you can\u00a0have a private copy of Boost in your library that will not come into conflict with other Boost installations in your setting. While for e.g. conda-forge a good ecosystem exists that provides the unique Boost version, in the setting of the manylinux1 wheels we have no control over which other Boost version exists.",
