Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNoticed that **Structural Transforms** do not have the same kernel listing in compute documentation between [C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/cpp/compute.rst) and [Python](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/python/api/compute.rst). Update the Python docs to be consistent with C++ kernel categorization.",
