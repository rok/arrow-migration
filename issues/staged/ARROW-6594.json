Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAvro supports some logical types that overlap with Arrow logical types\u00a0([http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#Logical+Types) ](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#Logical+Types)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor the ones that overlap, we should use the appropriate Arrow Logical type array instead of the raw values.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nit potentially makes sense to break this down further into sub-tasks for each logical type.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
