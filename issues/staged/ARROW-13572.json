Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is significant interest in having directory-partitioned ORC support from users of Dask.\u00a0 Since Dask already leverages the pyarrow.datasets API for parquet-formatted data, having ORC support through the same pyarrow API would be extremely useful.",
