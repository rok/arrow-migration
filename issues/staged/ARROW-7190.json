        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7190](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7190). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should have an easy way to trigger an extra set of builds but not the full matrix that runs nightly. For example, we should have a python group that runs one conda osx build, one wheel build, etc., not across all versions. Most of the time when we have a nightly build failure on python packaging, we get 5 failures for the same error, so we should be able to detect these more cheaply.\r\n\r\nWe already have build groups in crossbow, so this means adding new groups.",
