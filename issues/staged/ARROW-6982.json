Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/compare.h and boolean.h. ARROW-6980 introduces an Expression class that works on Arrow Arrays, but to evaluate the expressions, it has to pull the data into R first. This would enable us to do the work in C++ and only pull in the result.",
