        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18340](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18340). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a python build env var to control whether the Arrow C++ header files are included in the python package or not (`PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP_HEADERS`). This is set to True by default, and only in the conda recipe set to False.\r\n\r\nAfter the cmake refactor, the Python C++ header files no longer live in the Arrow C++ package, and so should _always_ be included in the python package, regardless of how arrow-cpp is installed. \r\nInitially this was done, but it seems that https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13892 removed this unconditional copy of the PyArrow header files to `pyarrow/include`. Now it is only copied if `PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP_HEADERS` is enabled.\r\n",
