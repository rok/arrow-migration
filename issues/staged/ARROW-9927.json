        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9927](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9927). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe open_dataset() function in the R arrow package already includes the support for dplyr filter, select and rename functions. However, it would be a huge improvement if it also could include other functions such as group_by, summarise and mutate before calling collect(). Is there any idea or projet going on to do so ? Would be it possible to include those features (compatible also with dplyr version < 1) ?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for this excellent job.",

We have issues covering much of the essential C++ query engine work but no idea on timeline when individuals will be able to complete the work. "
