Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOriginally raised as part of [PR #12433](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12433).\r\n\r\n> This implementation made me think of the various as.\\* methods we have defined [1] (since this is similar to as.Date()). Which all use a simpler setup to create a cast operation. However, I noticed that for those, they are using Expression$create(...) rather than the build_expr(...) helper [2]. That build_expr(...) here should handle the wrapping of R objects into Scalars (...)\n> \n> (...)We should also open a jira if one doesn't exist to clean up those as.\\* methods to use build_expr()",
