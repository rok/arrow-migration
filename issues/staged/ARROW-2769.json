Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDeprecate and replace `pyarrow.Field.add_metadata` (and other likely named methods) with replace_metadata, set_metadata or with_metadata. Knowing Spark's immutable API, I would have chosen with_metadata but I guess this is probably not what the average Python user would expect as naming.",
