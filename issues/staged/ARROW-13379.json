Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA running list as I try to figure out how to run archery locally:\r\n\r\n- dev/archery needs a README.md (even if it just links to `docs/source/developers/archery.rst` and `docs/source/developers/crossbow.rst`)\n- The `archery --help` example output on the docs is outdated\n- `archery crossbow --help` shows nothing of use\n- To install crossbow, `pip install -e \"dev/archery[crossbow]\"` (note: the quotes are required on zsh shells)\n- Do I \\***really**\\* need to create the queue? IME I don't I can use ursacomputing/crossbow and it just works \u2014 that's _probably_ because I have been granted permissions there. If that's the case we should explain that (\"if you have permissions at ursacopmuting/crossbow you don't need to ... just clone the ursacopmuting/crossbow repo and... but if you do not have permissions, then you should ....\")",

When the crossbow job checks out a specific hash, that hash must be in the remote that's being triggered. So if I were to sync my fork with upstream (but not push to my fork on github yet), and then use `--arrow-sha`\u00a0to specify a hash (that is not yet pushed to my github fork), that would fail, but pushing would then make it work. (alternatively I could/should specify the remote manually with `-arrow-remote`)"
