        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6923](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6923). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHow nulls are handled in the boolean mask (selection vector) in a filter kernel varies between languages / data analytics systems (e.g. base R propagates nulls, dplyr R skips (sees as False), SQL generally skips them as well I think, Julia raises an error).\r\n\r\nCurrently, in Arrow C++ we \"propagate\" nulls (null in the selection vector gives a null in the output):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [7]: arr = pa.array([1, 2, 3]) \r\n\r\nIn [8]: mask = pa.array([True, False, None]) \r\n\r\nIn [9]: arr.filter(mask) \r\nOut[9]: \r\n<pyarrow.lib.Int64Array object at 0x7fefe44b3048>\r\n[\r\n  1,\r\n  null\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven the different ways this could be done (propagate, skip, error), should we provide an option to control this behaviour?",
