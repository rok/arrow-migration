Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should make it easy to stream Arrow in the browser via [whatwg/streams](https://github.com/whatwg/streams). I already have this working at Graphistry, but I had to use some of the IPC internal methods. Creating this issue to track back-porting that work and the few minor refactors to the IPC internals that we'll need to do.",
