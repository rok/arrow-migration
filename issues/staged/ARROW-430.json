        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-430](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-430). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe need better version handling for Python releases. `setuptools_scm`\u00a0sadly conflicts a bit a with the workflow of conda-forge+git. In general, it seems that generating a version from a non-tagged git archive is not possible.\n\nFor tagged archives, we can use git's `export-subst` functionality but that will result in non-deterministic tarballs from Github.\n\nMy currently preferred (when not really clean but at least integrated into the release process) solution would be to read `java/pom.xml`\u00a0and use this version number. For PEP-440 compability we would need to replace `SNAPSHOT` with `pre1`.",
