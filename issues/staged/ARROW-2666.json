        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2666). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCalling `numpy.asarray`\u00a0on an instance of `Array/ChunkedArray/Column` should call the `to_pandas`\u00a0method of these classes. Currently it falls back to using the iterator interface, thus we will always get an `object` array of `pa.lib.ScalarValue`.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, one has to implement the `__array__` method on all of them.",
