Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome pretty prints, especially for chunked or nested arrays, can be very long even with reasonable window settings. We should have a way to set some target maximum length to output.\r\n\r\nA half-measure was taken with ARROW-15329, which truncates the output of the pretty printing, but that doesn't handle string columns very well if those string values contain delimiters.",
