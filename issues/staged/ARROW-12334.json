I have been working on debugging it and now it suddenly is working, so I don't know if it is an intermittent bug or not. When it works correctly, the query returns 4 rows and takes ~13 seconds for me. When it does not work it returns many times more rows and takes 3x as long.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to get a second pair of eyes on this."

We are getting RepartitionExec in the plan which is not compatible with Ballista and explodes the number of partitions (and likely causes incorrect results)\r\n2. The query actually works fine and the final sort produces 2 rows, but the results are created by reading all the intermediate results as well"
