Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn several docstrings (of orc.read_table, parquet.read_table/ParquetDataset/write_to_dataset, we have something like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nfilesystem : FileSystem, default None\r\n    If nothing passed, paths assumed to be found in the local on-disk\r\n    filesystem.\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this is actually no longer up to date. If filesystem is not specified, it will be inferred from the path, which can both be a path to local disk, or be a URI.",
