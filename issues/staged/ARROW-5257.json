Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee logo at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qmvPpFU7sdm9l6A6LEyI0zIzswGtJW0Sbd_lfHLaXQs/edit#slide=id.g4258234456_0_1\r\n\r\nAn unofficial logo lacking the \"Apache\" has been making the rounds on the internet, so I think it would be a good idea to update our web properties with the approved logo as discussed on the mailing list\r\n\r\nWhoever does this task \u2013 please make sure to compress the PNG asset of the logo prior to checking in to source control",

I can make this work with the one from the presentation but it would be better if there were originals.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI added a transparent background to the image in the presentation (not perfectly) and experimented with sticking it in the top left of the page, where you'd expect it and where other Apache projects tend to put their logo, and it's not awesome. IMO we either should make a white version of the logo/wordmark, change the header not to be dark, or both.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n![image-2019-05-03-16-19-05-041.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12967821/image-2019-05-03-16-19-05-041.png)"

Thoughts? If you want to keep it black everywhere, I'll need to make revisions to the site theme (not a problem, just confirming).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n![image-2019-05-08-13-15-53-694.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12968212/image-2019-05-08-13-15-53-694.png)"
