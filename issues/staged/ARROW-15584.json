Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAny relation in Substrait is allowed to \"emit\" the output which means reordering the columns (and possibly dropping columns?).\r\n\r\nThe C++ Substrait consumer currently does not handle this.\r\n\r\nThis functionality could probably be handled by a project operation in the Arrow execution engine.",

However, ARROW-16986 probably has lower priority."
