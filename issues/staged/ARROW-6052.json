Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince these files are getting larger, this would improve codebase navigability. Probably should use the same naming scheme as builder_\\* e.g. `arrow/array/array_dict.h`\r\n\r\nI recommend also putting the unit test files related to these in there for better semantic organization.
