Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of immediately pushing to outputs, ExecNodes should package their work into tasks and defer execution to allow more sophisticated external scheduling. This will also relieve pipeline breaking ExecNodes of the responsibility to ensure their work is correctly parallelized.",
