Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI think it would be easier to understand the changes if I send a PR to include the GCS library into ThirdpartyToolchain (see ARROW-8147), and then a separate PR to include the library in the different package manager files (`vcpkg`, and `conda`).\r\n\r\nIf this turns out to be a terrible idea, can simply close this issue and do the work in a single PR.\r\n",
