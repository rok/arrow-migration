        "title": "[C++] Failed to build arrow-cpp with gcc 4.9.2",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9183](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9183). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe\u00a0[Building Arrow C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-0.17.1/docs/source/developers/cpp/building.rst) document say \"building requires a C++11-enabled compiler. On Linux, gcc 4.8 and higher should be sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nBut actually, it failed to build with gcc 4.9.2 (see attached image-2020-06-19-11-29-13-641.png). This is because a bug in gcc [Bug 57250](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57250)\r\n\r\nPlease note it in the document to lead using a higher version of gcc. Current document is still misleading.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNEED TRIAGE, because the\u00a0[atomic_shared_ptr.h](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-0.17.1/cpp/src/arrow/util/atomic_shared_ptr.h) file is aim to eliminate the bug. But the error occurred when compiling it.\r\n\r\nOK, got it. I installed clang but still using the gcc 4.9.2's libstdc++. The bug appeared then.\r\n\r\nI think it more reliable to check libstdc++ version instead of the gcc version, because this is a libstdc++ bug instead of a gcc bug. I found it possible to [check the libstdc++ version via MACRO \\_\\_GLIBCXX\\_\\_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10354636/how-do-you-find-what-version-of-libstdc-library-is-installed-on-your-linux-mac) with help of [this timeline table](https://gcc.gnu.org/develop.html#timeline).",
