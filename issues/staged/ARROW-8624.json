        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8624](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8624). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've seen a few reports like <https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/7055>, where the user reports that they've installed the arrow system packages, we can see that they exist, but `pkg-config` reports that it doesn't have them. I think this is because `-larrow_dataset` isn't found. As the output on that issue shows, while arrow core headers and libraries are there, arrow_dataset is not.\r\n\r\n~~Searching through the packaging scripts (such as <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/linux-packages/apache-arrow/yum/arrow.spec.in>), while there is some metadata about a dataset package, I see that ARROW_DATASET=ON is not set anywhere, so I don't think we're building it.~~ So apparently we are building it, but we aren't documenting how to get it.",
