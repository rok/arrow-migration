Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPlease could we have maths with timestamps implemented?\r\n\r\nIn order to implement some of the functionality I'd like in R, I need to be able to do maths with dates.  For example:\r\n\r\n- Addition and subtraction: Timestamp + Duration = Timestamp (with and without rollback so have ability to do e.g. 2021-03-30 minus 1 month and either get a null back, or 2021-02-28), plus the ability to specify whether to rollback to the first or last, and whether to preserve or rest the time.\n  \n  See https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/mplus.html for documentation of the R functionality.\n  \n- Multiplying Durations: Duration \\* Numeric = Duration",

If that is the case you could just use the add/sub/muldiv kernels from ARROW-11090 and add _floor/ceil_ for rollback cases. In case there is something still missing in C++ we should identify it and write Jiras."
