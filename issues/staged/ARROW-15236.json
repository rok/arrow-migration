        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15236](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15236). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI cannot for the life of me figure out how to write a DATE to a Parquet file using the parquet::StreamWriter API.\u00a0 See attached example code, which generates this exception when writing the second column:\r\n```java\n\r\n\u276f ./parquet\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'parquet::ParquetException'\r\n\u00a0 what(): \u00a0Column converted type mismatch. \u00a0Column 'date' has converted type[DATE] not 'INT_32'\r\n```\r\nI have also tried:\r\n- Declaring the field's type as `INT64`, which yields the exception `DATE can only annotate INT32` when defining the schema.\n- Declaring the field using the alternate version of `Make` with `LogicalType::Date(), Type::INT32`.  This yields the same exception as the code attached.\n",
