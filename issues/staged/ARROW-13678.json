Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the Sphinx docs, it is currently a bit frustrating that cell tables quickly wrap around, because the width of the main text column is rather small:\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html#aggregations\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to find a way to make the width larger. Perhaps by making the left bar narrower and/or collapsable?",
