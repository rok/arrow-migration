        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16759](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16759). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe packges under github.com/apache/arrow/go currently have a dependency on github.com/stretchr/testify v1.7.0 which has a dependency on gopkg.in/yaml.v3 that has an outstanding security vulnerability. ([CVE-2022-28948](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hp87-p4gw-j4gq))\r\n\r\nWhile testify is only used during tests, this is not distinguished by the go toolchain and other tools like Snyk which scan the dependency chain for vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, due to Go's [Minimal version selection\\|[https://go.dev/ref/mod#minimal-version-selection],] this ends up requiring us to visit our dependencies to ensure this security vulnerability is addressed.",
