We need to verify that they match C+ methods in terms of constness and default values.",

I updated the title/description."

It just translates its own language into C/C++ that another tool will compile. So the C/C++ declarations that you give to Cython are just to allow it emit the right C/C++ code, they don't need to match the actual C/C++ APIs exactly (which is actually convenient in cases where the exact declarations cannot be faithfully represented in Cython)."
