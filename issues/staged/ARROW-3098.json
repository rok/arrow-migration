        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3098](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3098). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have a script that creates a Parquet file and then writes it out to a `BufferOutputStream` and then into a `BufferReader` with the intention of passing it to a place that takes a file-like object to upload it somewhere else. But the other location relies on being able to seek to the end of the file to figure out how big the file is, e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nreader.seek(0, 2)\r\nsize = reader.tell()\r\nreader.seek(0)\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut when I do that the following exception is raised:\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```Java\n\r\npyarrow/io.pxi:209: in pyarrow.lib.NativeFile.seek\r\n???\r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\r\n\r\n> ???\r\nE pyarrow.lib.ArrowIOError: position out of bounds\r\n```\r\n\r\nI compared it to casting to an `io.BytesIO` instead which works:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport io\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_arrow_output_stream():\r\n    output = pa.BufferOutputStream()\r\n    output.write(b'hello')\r\n\r\n    reader = pa.BufferReader(output.getvalue())\r\n\r\n    reader.seek(0, 2)\r\n    assert reader.tell() == 5\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_python_io_stream():\r\n    output = pa.BufferOutputStream()\r\n    output.write(b'hello')\r\n\r\n    buffer = io.BytesIO(output.getvalue().to_pybytes())\r\n    reader = io.BufferedRandom(buffer)\r\n\r\n    reader.seek(0, 2)\r\n    assert reader.tell() == 5\r\n```",
