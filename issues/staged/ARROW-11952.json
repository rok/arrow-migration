Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n1. Background:\n   Left over cleanups suggested by from @sunchao on  https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9425\n   \n   Broken out from https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9508\n   \n1. Rationale:\n   \n   Rationale: don't use panic! directly (though the caller of this function still calls `unwrap()` so I am not sure how much of an improvement this change really is. However it sets us up for a more `safe` future eventually\n",
