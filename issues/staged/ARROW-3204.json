        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3204](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3204). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs of\u00a0[ARROW-1325](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1325),\u00a0the project contains a minimal working R package that takes advantage of R's built-in support for calling C++ code and uses Rcpp for added support.\r\n\r\nThough the exact public interface of the package hasn't been developed yet (so this issue may be running before we walk), one major feature in its development will be release to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), the official package repository for the R language.\r\n\r\nCompleting this story would mean:\r\n \\* Getting source code to state where\u00a0 [R CMD CHECK](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-r-cmd-check/)\u00a0passes with 0 ERRORS, 0 WARNINGS, and 0 NOTES\r\n \\* Setting up build process for source and precompiled binary packages (see\u00a0 [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table)\u00a0and\u00a0[XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)\u00a0as examples of packages that do this)\r\n \\* Submission to CRAN and acceptance of the first release\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDistribution via CRAN would be a much more natural fit for most R users' workflows than the\u00a0current build-from-source workflow, and comes with all the other benefits of package managers (e.g. version pegging, easy distribution of platform-specific binaries).",

However, this is likely to take a few months since we have to first:\r\n1. Have an appropriate build process for Windows which Jeroen is leading, see [rwinlib/arrow\\|[https://github.com/rwinlib/arrow].]\n1. Proper appveyor automation. The\u00a0UrsaLabs\u00a0team is planning to hire a build engineer to help, in the meantime, Kirill might be able to help get this going to make sure Jeroen's work does not regress as Arrow 0.13 gets developed.\n1. Have an appropriate build process for OS X.\n1. The Arrow libraries need to get distributed in the official Debian repository to be allowed in CRAN. Wes mentioned that,\u00a0Kouhei (hoping I got this right), might be able to help the project navigate this in the next few months.\n   \n   So, while we completely agree with you that is imperative that Arrow gets in CRAN, in the meantime, we could still make use of Arrow in OS X and Linux using the remotes package (or devtools)\u00a0by installing the Arrow runtime first, followed by:\n   ```java\n   \n   remotes::install_github(\"apache/arrow\", subdir = \"r\")\n   ```"

So this further complicates things for R bindings on MacOS.\r\n\r\nI am guessing that the build broke because the 0.11 tarball has been removed from the apache website, even though 0.12 hasn't even been announced yet? <https://www.apache.org/dist/arrow/>\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
