Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe goal of this task is to support the string operation of extracting an item of a regex group, something like sparks' `regexp_extract`.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe could do this in the arrow crate and expose it on DataFusion. Note that arrow already depends on an external regex parser for Rust.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
