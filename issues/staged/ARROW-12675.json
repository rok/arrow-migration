Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently if an error occurs while parsing a CSV file the absolute line/row number is not part of the error message. Without the line number it can be very hard to determine where the incorrect value is especially in vary large files.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if the reader and parser could keep track of the row number and maybe line number when new lines are allowed in values so that they can be included in error message.",
