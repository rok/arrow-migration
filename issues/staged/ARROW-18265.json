Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`FieldRef::FromDotPath` can parse a single list element field. ie. `{}'path.to.list[0]`{`}but does not work in practice. Failing with:\r\n\r\n_struct_field: cannot subscript field of type list<....>_\r\n\r\nBeing able to add a slice or multiple list elements is not within the scope of this issue.\u00a0",

Unlike `struct_field` however, this function is binary instead of unary and takes the index as the second argument.  In theory, that should be fine, as you can just pass a scalar / constant value as the second argument."

Or also for variable lists?  If for variable lists then what should happen when the list isn't long enough to satisfy the index?  I assume this would return null?"

Suspecting I need to investigate the `FieldRef::FindAll` visitor implementation, but not 100% sure right now. \r\n\r\nI'll be sure to ping you for a review once I have something worth looking at. :-) "
