Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/vector/src/main/codegen/templates/VariableLengthVectors.java#L492\n\nHere VariableLengthVectors.getMutator().setSafe() calls:\n```Java\noffsetVector.getAccessor().get(index)\n```\n\n however, index 0 of offsetVector (which is always 0) is not initialized by VariableLengthVectors.\n\nAs a result, user of the VariableLengthVectors needs to manually initialize \nthe class by calling:\n```Java\nVariableLengthVectors.getOffsetVector().getMutator().setSafe(0, 0)\n```\n\nI wonder if this is necessary or should VariableLengthVectors initialize this for the user\n",

In order to use vectors, the correct order of operations are:\n\n1. allocateNew() (allocate memory for the vector)\n2. Set one or more values using getMutator().setSafe(i, val). Note, this has to be monotonically increasing position but allows index skips.\n3. call set valueCount(n) where n is the number of valid indices in the vector\n4. read or serialize data\n\nI believe that if you follow these operations, you will not have a problem here. I'm guessing you're trying to use a vector before allocating (1).\n"
