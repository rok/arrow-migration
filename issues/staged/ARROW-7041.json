        "title": "[Python] PythonLibs setting found by CMake uses wrong version of Python on macOS",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7041](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7041). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm trying to build the Python library and run its tests, so to do that I need to first build the C++ library. I'm going through the Python Development Guide part of the docs. When invoking CMake to build the C++ library, it claims to have found PythonLibs here:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Found PythonLibs: /usr/local/Cellar/python@2/2.7.16_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython3.7m.dylib\r\n\r\nJust by looking at the whole path, it doesn't look like a promising location. And indeed, there's no libpython3.7\\*.dylib file in the Python 2.7 install directory. So the C++ build fails.\r\n\r\nI'm on macOS 10.14.6. I have Python 2.7 and 3.7 both installed via Homebrew. (There is a libpython3.7\\*.dylib file in the Python 3.7 install of Homebrew.) For the Python build dependencies, I have a Python 3.7 venv active and they are installed there via pip. This happens with\u00a0-DARROW_PYTHON=ON.\r\n\r\nThis definitely looks like whatever piece of CMake code that is trying to find PythonLibs is grabbing the first directory it finds, and appending a path to the dylib without looking if it exists. However, I don't know much of anything about CMake. Any suggestion for a fix or at least a workaround to point CMake to the PythonLibs directory that would make more sense?",

Thanks!\r\n\r\nI did run into a couple small issus with the Python Development doc page however: 1) the conda build worked fine for me on macOS, and 2) the instructions mention a\u00a0`$ARROW_BUILD_TYPE` environment variable, which is never set in the page. New Jira issue, then pull request for those?"
