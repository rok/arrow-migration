Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis requires to fix the docker-compose build of R, which is failing currently:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/kszucs/crossbow/builds/508343597\r\n\r\nReproducible locally with command:\r\n```Java\n\r\ndocker-compose build cpp\r\ndocker-compose build r\r\ndocker-compose run r\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen introduce an `R_VERSION` build argument to the dockerfile, similarly like\r\nthe python docker-compose defines and uses `PYTHON_VERSION`, see:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/Dockerfile#L21\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L247-L259\n  \n  Then add to the nightly builds, similarly like python:\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/tests.yml#L29-L31\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/tests.yml#L153-L184\n  \n  There is already a `docker-r` definition, the only difference is to export an \n  `R_VERSION` environment variable.\n",
