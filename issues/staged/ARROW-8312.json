Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGandiva C++ provided IN API[1] is able to accept TreeNode as param, which allows IN expression to operate on output of some function.
