        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16991](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16991). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs documented here: <https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/PageIndex.md>\r\n\r\nThe parquet format supports indexing of pages within a column chunk. Beyond what is accomplished by rowgroup statistics, this can further accelerate scanning.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am able to tell, Arrow does not currently support these indices (I see no references to `{}offset_index_offset{`}, `{}column_index_offset{`}, etc). Are there plans to add support, either in C++ or pyarrow?",
