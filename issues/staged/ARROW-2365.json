Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen certain `PlasmaClient` methods are called with bad arguments, PlasmaClient crashes instead of returning an error Status. For example, try calling `Seal()` with a non-existent object id.\r\n\r\nThis is hostile towards users of high-level languages such as Python.",

It would be a good idea to go through and note which ones are esoteric \"can't fail\" errors and which could be caused by improper use by a Python user. "
