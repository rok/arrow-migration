Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAlias _TypeClass_ in _[BinaryScalar](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/scalar.h#L217)_\u00a0and _[LargeBinaryScalar](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/scalar.h#L242)_\u00a0are being _BinaryScalar_ and _LargeBinaryScalar_. Are they supposed to be _BinaryType_\u00a0and _LargeBinaryType_?\r\n\r\nI'm having issues when I use _TypeTrait_ on _ScalarType::TypeClass_ - compiler complains that there are no whatever members in specialized _TypeTrait<BinaryScalar>_ and\u00a0_TypeTrait<LargeBinaryScalar>_.",
