        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5905](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5905). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently allow constructing a decimal array from decimal.Decimal objects or from ints:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [14]: pa.array([1, 0], type=pa.decimal128(2))                                                                                                              \r\nOut[14]: \r\n<pyarrow.lib.Decimal128Array object at 0x7f51fa2da818>\r\n[\r\n  1,\r\n  0\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn [31]: pa.array([decimal.Decimal('0.1'), decimal.Decimal('0.2')], pa.decimal128(2, 1))                                                                      \r\nOut[31]: \r\n<pyarrow.lib.Decimal128Array object at 0x7fce671172b0>\r\n[\r\n  0.1,\r\n  0.2\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut not from floats (or strings):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [18]: pa.array([0.1, 0.2], pa.decimal128(2))                                                                                                               \r\n...\r\nArrowTypeError: int or Decimal object expected, got float\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this something we would like to support?\r\n\r\nThere are for sure precision issues you run into, but if the decimal type is fully specified, it seems clear what the user wants. In general, since decimal objects in pandas are not that easy to work with, many people might have plain float columns that they want to convert to decimal. ",

(meaning, we could leave the issue open as a possible future enhancement, if we want this)"

Now we accept Python decimal.Decimal objects, but also ints, so why not floats or strings? After ARROW-7011, I think it would be a relatively easy addition to also accept also those types in `DecimalFromPyObject` (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/bcbb3e2c350b3889c19b3c3fdbb0a88d5c8f1cbd/cpp/src/arrow/python/decimal.cc#L148-L164).\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage might be that the object-by-object conversion in the `DecimalConverter` (involving Python) might be less efficient than a cast in case of a typed float array as input."
