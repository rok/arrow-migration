Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe integration checks only test that the benchmark queries run without error. They do not check that the results are correct.\r\n\r\nI think some work already happened in DataFusion to check the TPC-H results so hopefully we can re-use that work.",
