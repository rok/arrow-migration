        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15332](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15332). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis breaks out the benchmark changes in ARROW-14577 to allow us to more easily demonstrate the effect of the PR.\r\n\r\nFirst, there are a few problems with the current benchmark:\r\n\r\n \\* The benchmark named ReadFile is misleading since it is actually reading from an in-memory buffer and no OS \"read\" call is ever issued.\r\n \\* Renamed ReadTempFile to ReadCachedFile and added a second case for ReadUncachedFile.  The former reads a file in the OS' page cache and the latter forces a read to actually hit the disk.\r\n \\* The TempFile benchmarks were not actually writing the correct amount of data and were reporting unrealistically high rates as a result.\r\n \\* Adding a \"partial read\" parameter which, when true, only reads 1/8 the columns in the file so we can see the impact of pushdown projection.\r\n \\* Slightly reduced the range of parameters to keep the benchmark time reasonable (8k columns wasn't telling us anything more than 4k columns).",
