        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15952](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15952). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe mention in the docs that:\r\n> The classes arrow::Array and its subclasses provide strongly-typed accessors with support for the visitor pattern and other affordances.\r\n\r\nBut ArrayVisitor class and the `Array::Accept()` [method](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/b956ba51ea11d050745e09548e33aa61fdcbfddc/cpp/src/arrow/array/array_base.h#L136) are missing from the API docs. We should add those, and potentially also provide an example of using the visitor.\r\n\r\nLikely worth doing the same for TypeVisitor and ScalarVisitor. It would also be nice to document the performance implication of using ScalarVisitor vs ArrayVisitor. Also we use an \"inline\" version of the visitors; is that something we do/should expose in the API as well?",
