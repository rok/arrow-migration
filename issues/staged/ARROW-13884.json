        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13884](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13884). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter trying to compile a typescript project, that contains `import \\{ Table } from 'apache-arrow';` I get Typescript errors.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. installed ` \"typescript\": \"4.2.2\"` and ` \"apache-arrow\": \"^5.0.0\",`\n1. run `tsc\u00a0--traceResolution`\n   \n   \u00a0\n   \n   Expected result:\n   \n   Compiles without errors.\n   \n   \u00a0\n   \n   Actual Result:\n   ```\n   \n   ======== Module name 'apache-arrow' was successfully resolved to '/.../apache/node_modules/apache-arrow/Arrow.node.d.ts' with Package ID 'apache-arrow/Arrow.node.d.ts@5.0.0'. ========\n   ======== Resolving module './Arrow.dom' from '/.../apache/node_modules/apache-arrow/Arrow.node.d.ts'. ========\n   Explicitly specified module resolution kind: 'NodeJs'.\n   Loading module as file / folder, candidate module location '/.../apache/node_modules/apache-arrow/Arrow.dom', target file type 'TypeScript'.\n   File '/.../apache/node_modules/apache-arrow/Arrow.dom.ts' exist - use it as a name resolution result.\n   \n   ```\n   \n   Since Typescript files live alongside Javascript files, NodeJS module resolution resolves `Arrow.dom` in the main file to `Arrow.dom.ts`, and all of the other .ts files imported there are being compiled.",
