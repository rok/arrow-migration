Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMy apologies if this is already being adressed.\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Latest version of arrow on CRAN depends on libthrift-0.16.0.so. However, thrift on the Arch community repo has been updated to version 0.17.0-1, replacing with libthrift-0.17.0.so.\r\n\r\n{**}Solution{**}: Downgrading thrift to 0.16.0-1 through pacman solves the issue.",
