        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11424](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11424). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA StructType is basically a Schema (vector of Fields), right? Likewise, a StructArray is pretty much the same as a RecordBatch, right? Schema and RecordBatch have many more methods than StructType/StructArray, but we should be able to do the same kinds of things to structs.\r\n\r\nAlso, an observation while working on ARROW-11423: the method to extract an Array column from a StructArray is called `field()} and {{GetFieldByName()`, which is confusing since Schema/StructType is what contains Field objects, and `StructArray::field()` returns Array, not Field.\r\n\r\ncc `[~bkietz]` `[~apitrou]`",
