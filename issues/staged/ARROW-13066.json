Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe mention which operating systems we support: https://arrow.apache.org/install/#c-and-glib-c-packages-for-debian-gnulinux-ubuntu-and-centos\r\n\r\nAnd which Python versions: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/python.html\r\n\r\nBut we should also include other languages (e.g. R), as well as some philosophy / criteria for how long we support them (Python versions until they are EOLed, R versions 5 years back, ...)\r\n\r\nAdditionally: \"It would be good to make a note somewhere of (1) platforms we test on, (2) platforms we have worked to support in the past but don't have CI for (e.g. solaris, ibm something that came up recently, raspbian per Nic's issue, etc.), and (3) what one can do if they want to add support for some other platform not listed\" -Neal",
