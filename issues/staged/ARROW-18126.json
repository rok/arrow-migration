        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18126](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18126). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen building pyarrow, I see the following warning:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nCMake Warning:\r\n  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:\r\n\r\n    ARROW_BUILD_DIR\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile we have a note in our docs (https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/developers/python.html#build-and-test) that says:\r\n\r\n> If you used a different directory name for building Arrow C++ (by default it is named \u201cbuild\u201d), then you should also set the environment variable `ARROW_BUILD_DIR='name_of_build_dir'`. This way PyArrow can find the Arrow C++ built files.\r\n\r\nI see in the setup.py code that we check for this env variable and pass it to CMake, but it's not actually used in any of the CMakeLists.txt files for pyarrow.\r\n\r\nThis might have been accidentally changed in one of the recent cmake refactors?

The rest of it was in the flight section which is now changed but I haven't been able to found a commit at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think this variable is not needed anymore and can be removed. Great catch Joris!"
