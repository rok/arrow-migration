        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14548](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14548). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the `MemoryMappedFile` API allows users to specify a list of read ranges to advise operating system to prefetch `WillNeed` data for better IO performance, and sometimes, the application's read pattern is random access, and `POSIX_MADV_RANDOM` advice should be given to operating system to indicate this so that application with random access capability can perform better by leveraging this API.\r\n\r\nhttps://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html",
