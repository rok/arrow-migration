        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11206](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11206). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe \"project\" compute Function is necessary for ARROW-11174. However it is not intended for direct use outside an Expression ([where the correspondence to projection is not immediately obvious](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9131#issuecomment-757764173)) so it may be preferable to do one/more of:\r\n \\* rename the function to \"wrap_struct\" or similar so it does make sense outside Expressions\r\n \\* ensure the function is not exposed to python/R bindings except through Expressions\r\n \\* remove the function from the default registry",
