        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6415](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6415). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom email from BDR at CRAN: \r\n\r\n\"R CMD config CXXCPP has been deprecated: it is not used by R itself and \r\nthere are several things wrong with the standard autoconf detection code:\r\n\r\n- If CXXCPP is set by the user, it is not tested.  It could be empty, \n  which AFAICS none of you allow for.\n- The code looks at $CXX -E and /lib/cpp in turn, and tests a system C \n  header without consulting CPPFLAGS.  /lib/cpp is unlikely to find C++ \n  headers, and we have seen instances where without CPPFLAGS it did not \n  find C headers.\n- It is the setting for the default C++ compiler, in R-devel C++11 but \n  not specified in earlier R (even 3.6.x could be C++98).\n  \n  It would be better to use $(CXX) -E (or $(CXX11) etc) or test for yourself.\n  \n  Please change at the next package update.\"",
