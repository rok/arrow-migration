Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe now have a check for gcc11; however, gcc11 has been the default on debian/testing for some time. The CRAN debian image now uses gcc12, so we should update the gcc11 task to use gcc12 here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/0e03af446c328d0ef963510c3292cb14e092b917/dev/tasks/tasks.yml#L1319-L1328",
