        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8467](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8467). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTest cases using ArrayFromJSON assumes little endian platform\r\n\r\nThe following test cases seem to assume little-endian platform.\r\nTEST_F(TestChunkedArray, View) at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/table_test.cc#L175\r\nTEST(TestArrayView, PrimitiveAsFixedSizeBinary) at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/array_view_test.cc#L105\r\nTEST(TestArrayView, StructAsStructSimple) at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/array_view_test.cc#L126\r\nTEST(TestArrayView, ExtensionType) at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/array_view_test.cc\r\n\r\nOne of examples is `PrimitiveAsFixedSizeBinary`.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nTEST(TestArrayView, PrimitiveAsFixedSizeBinary) {\r\n  auto arr = ArrayFromJSON(int32(), \"[2020568934, 2054316386, null]\");\r\n  auto expected = ArrayFromJSON(fixed_size_binary(4), R\"([\"foox\", \"barz\", null])\");\r\n  CheckView(arr, expected);\r\n  CheckView(expected, arr);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected strings are represented in binary as follows:\r\n```Java\n\r\n\"foox\" = [0x66 0x6f 0x6f 0x78]\r\n\"barz\" = [0x62 0x61 0x72 0x7a]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test gives a value as raw int32. The current values assume only a little-endian platform as follows to generate the expected binary sequence.\r\n```Java\n\r\n2020568934 = 0x786f6f66\r\n2054316386 = 0x7a726162\r\n```",
