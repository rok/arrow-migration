Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm running some microbenchmarks over at <https://github.com/andygrove/row-vs-col-rs> to compare performance of arrow to just using Vec<> and I'm finding that Arrow is 18x slower in these benchmarks.\r\n\r\nI am quite surprised at this performance difference so am creating this issue and will attempt to optimize the code.",

I\u00a0found a faster way of computing sum, but was just\u00a0after the original PR was merged.\u00a0I'll have a look at your benchmarks to see if that's the cause of slow sum performance"
