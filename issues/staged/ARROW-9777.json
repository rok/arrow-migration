        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9777](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9777). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are a number of IPC changes and features which the Rust implementation has fallen behind on. It's effectively using the legacy format that was released in 0.14.x.\r\n\r\nSome that I encountered are:\r\n \\* change padding from 4 bytes to 8 bytes (along with the padding algorithm)\r\n \\* add an IPC writer option to support the legacy format and updated format\r\n \\* add error handling for the different metadata versions, we should support v4+ so it's an oversight to not explicitly return errors if unsupported versions are read\r\n\r\nSome of the work already has Jiras open (e.g. body compression), I'll find them and mark them as related to this.\r\n\r\nI'm tight for spare time, but I'll try work on this before the next release (along with the Parquet writer)",

We've fallen behind a bit, and we might run a rist of hitting a compatibility issue in future, given that more users are starting to use the Rust implementation (specifically IPC).\r\n\r\nI've done some work already on the V5 JIRA, reads work well, but some writes still create invalid outputs. If the next release is around Jan, I should be able to get to it."
