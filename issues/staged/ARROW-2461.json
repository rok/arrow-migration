Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is now work in progress on an updated manylinux tag based on CentOS6. We should provide wheels for this tag and the old `manylinux1` tag for one release and then switch to the new tag in the release afterwards. This should enable us also to raise the minimum compiler requirement to gcc 4.9 (or higher once conda-forge has migrated to a newer compiler).\r\n\r\nThe relevant PEP is https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/",

So RHEL 6 has glibc 2.12 https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=redhat\r\n\r\nThe base image for manylinux1 is centos5 which tracks RHEL 5.\r\n\r\nhttps://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=centos\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is a radical proposal but we should promote our manylinux1 image to be based on centos6, which I guess is the same thing as manylinux2010. PyTorch and TensorFlow have already created toolchain problems \u2013 not to say that we should make things worse \u2013 but I am not sure that this would do very much harm compared with, say, using a different compiler (like Clang with statically linked libstdc++ instead of using the RedHat devtoolset)\r\n\r\nI don't know if we are doing ourselves any favors by being stuck on centos5 glibc, and the impacted users may be slow-to-upgrade enterprises which, I would hazard a guess, aren't contributing to Apache Arrow.

The manylinux1 PEP requires that we don't rely on anything younger than glibc 2.5. So using Abseil in a manylinux1 wheel is out of question (unless we want to be a bad citizen like Tensorflow is).\r\n\r\nNote that manylinux2010 is based on CentOS 6, i.e. its compatibility requirements for base libraries are based on what CentOS 6 provides."

Are there other examples of projects using manylinux2010? AFAIK the only thing \"bad\" about using the manylinux1 tag on a wheel built on centos6 would be the minimum glibc version. So while still _bad_ I think it's significantly less bad than what TensorFlow is doing, which is using a non-conforming compile and link procedure, in addition AFAIK to building on a newer Linux image. The only people impacted by this change would be users on very old Linux"
