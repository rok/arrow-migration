It may be particular to this machine or build (though it's 100% reproducible for me). I will check the Windows wheels to see if it occurs there, too\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n(C:\\tmp\\arrow-verify-release\\conda-env) \u03bb python\r\nPython 3.7.3 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jul  1 2019, 22:01:29) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import pyarrow.csv as pc\r\n>>> pc.ParseOptions()\r\n```",
