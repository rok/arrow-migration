        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10397](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10397). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile working on the Rust implementation, I got confused by [this comment](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/06d4f17247d8d4e1da730d3c7b380d522829f458/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/metadata_internal.cc#L430-L432) that said dictionary index types could be assumed to be signed integers. The Rust code allowed for unsigned integers, so I thought the Rust code had a bug. However, I read the C++ code more carefully, and unsigned integers are allowed as dictionary index types-- this was changed in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/b1a7a73ff2284f391b13588f4d7f65aa30df81e3) but the comment wasn't updated.\r\n\r\nI have a pull request fixing the comment, just want to save someone a few minutes of confusion :)",
