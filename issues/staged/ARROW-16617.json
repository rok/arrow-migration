Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `WinErrorMessage` utility function calls `FormatMessageA` in order to get the Windows error message. This unfortunately returns the message encoded using the current \"codepage\", which can give unreadable results if there are non-ASCII characters in it.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should probably use `FormatMessageW` and then convert to UTF-8. At least  `PyArrow` expects the error message in a `Status` to be utf8-encoded.",
