Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd micro-benchmarks for hash join exec node.\r\nWrite a new implementation of the interface HashJoinImpl making sure that it is efficient for all types of join.\u00a0Current implementation, based on unordered map, trades performance for a simpler code and is likely not as fast as it could be.",
