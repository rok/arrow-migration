Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```\n\r\nConda environment is active despite that USE_CONDA is set to 0.\r\n\r\nCommandNotFoundError: No command 'conda deactive'.\r\nDid you mean 'conda deactivate'?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe next line is `echo \"Deactivate the environment using `conda deactive` before running the verification script.\"` but this tries to _evaluate_ \"conda deactive\" which of course fails. The typo should be fixed, but also the backticks should be escaped.",
