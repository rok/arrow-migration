Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe recently vendored xxh3 in Arrow. Plasma may want to use it for object hashing, since it's supposed to be even faster than XXH64.\r\nSee https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html for performance numbers. ",
