        "title": "[R] Support converting POSIXlt type",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8867](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8867). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```r\n\r\nf <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time() + 1:5)\r\nArray$create(f)\r\n# Error in Array__from_vector(x, type) : \r\n#   Unknown: List vector expecting elements vector of type double but got int32\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssue #1: POSIXlt type is a struct, essentially. But because it is not a data.frame, we don't try to convert it to a struct. (We should probably convert named lists to structs and not list type in general.)\r\n\r\nIf I trick the converter into thinking it is a data.frame, it will convert to struct successfully.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nclass(f) <- c(class(f), \"data.frame\")\r\nArray$create(f)\r\n# StructArray\r\n# <struct<sec: double, min: int32, hour: int32, mday: int32, mon: int32, year: int32, wday: int32, yday: int32, isdst: int32, zone: string, gmtoff: int32>>\r\n# ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssue #2: round trip won't work because the attributes that tell you that this struct is a POSIXlt type, what time zone it is, etc., are dropped. This would be helped by storing those attributes as custom_metadata on the Table. (We could also implement it as an extension type, but if it's just for going back and forth between R, would that have any benefit?)",
