        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1298](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1298). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBased on research done for ARROW-1282, when using jemalloc along with other allocators, it is recommended to build jemalloc with a prefix to be used on all calls (so as not to confuse those calls with that of other allocators). See https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/wiki/Getting-Started for more info. ",
