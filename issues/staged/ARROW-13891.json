        "title": "[R] Function docs and arrow.Rmd vignette should be more explicit about why float32 objects report type as \"float\" and float64 objects report type as \"double\"",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13891](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13891). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a discrepancy between how fields created via `float32()` and `float64()` report their data types.\r\n```java\n\r\ntbl <- tibble::tibble(a = c(1:3), b = c(4:6))\r\nTable$create(tbl, schema = schema(a = float32(), b = float64()))\r\n## Table\r\n## 3 rows x 2 columns\r\n## $a <float>\r\n## $b <double>\r\n```\r\nThis is confusing, especially as our docs (see `?float64()` say:\r\n\r\n> \"When called inside an arrow function, such as schema() or cast(), double() also is supported as a way of creating a float64()\"\r\n\r\nThe reason behind this is that float64 is just an alias for double; however, calling it float64 nicely mimics the int8/16/32/64 pattern, **and** there is already a `double()` function in base R which we don't want to mask.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should add explanations to the docs to clarify that float64 == double.\r\n\r\nAs well as the function docs, we should also mention it in the vignette `arrow.Rmd`",
