Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGetFileInfo() seems to include mtime, size, path and type.\u00a0 For an S3 system, it would be nice to be able to reference the md5 sum without transferring the file, (which I think the server will have already computed?).\u00a0 This seems like the logical place to include it (though I wouldn't object to a more visible method too).\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n(though type isn't clear to me, since it appears to be an integer)",
