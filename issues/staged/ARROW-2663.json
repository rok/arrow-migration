Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, `dictionary_encode` and `unique` are only exposed on `Array` instances but the backing C++ code allows also to pass in the more higher classes. We should add them to the Cython interface so that they can be called from Python code.",
