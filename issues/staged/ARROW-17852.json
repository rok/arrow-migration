Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi there,\r\n\r\nFirst time submitting an issue here so apologies if there's anything I've missed.\r\n\r\nI see the below bug, where by the `dtype` of the categories themselves (within a `pd.Categorical` are not preserved on a round trip via pyarrow. Hopefully the snippet below demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nThe reason this causes an issue, is because the dtypes need to be the same in order for the categories to be considered the same (so they can then be concatenated, for example).\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround is to store as a plain `pd.StringDtype()` and then convert to `pd.Categorical` in memory with Pandas (which infers from the underlying type, but in doing so sacrifices disk saving of storing as a dictionary).\r\n\r\nUsing pyarrow 9.0.0 and pandas 1.4.4.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`import pandas as pd`\r\n\r\n`import pyarrow as pa`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`{}# note, Categorical column B is constructed from `pd.{`}`{}StringDtype`{`}\r\n\r\n`df = pd.DataFrame(\\{\"A\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"a\"]\\}, dtype=pd.StringDtype())`\r\n\r\n`df[\"B\"] = df[\"A\"].astype(\"category\")`\r\n\r\n`print(df[\"B\"].cat.categories)`\r\n`# Index(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='string')`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`# however, this is downcast to `object` during a roundtrip`\r\n\r\n`print(pa.Table.from_pandas(df).to_pandas()[\"B\"].cat.categories)`\r\n\r\n`# Index(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='object')`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
