Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-17436, the Windows/R 3.6 job is consistently failing. We're about to drop support for R 3.6 with the move to C++17, so instead of debugging this failure I think we should just disable this check.",
