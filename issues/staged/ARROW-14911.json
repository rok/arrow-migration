If I am reading the test correctly it initializes a random generator with a fixed seed.  So even though the test is testing random data it should be deterministic between runs.  I have verified that we are running this test on our CI servers (which includes VS2017 although at a higher version than 19.12).\r\n\r\nThe test does do some parallel execution so there is a possibility it is a race condition causing the flakiness.\r\n\r\nI also built locally with VS2019 in both debug mode and release and tried running this test both with and without CPU stress and have not been able to reproduce it.  I was doing this against the latest master and not the 6.0.1 tag so that might be a factor.  I will try and reproduce this some more tomorrow with VS2017.\r\n\r\n[~rip.nsk@gmail.com] How reliable is this failure?  Does it fail every time or intermittently?  When it fails does it always display the exact same output? (e.g. `RIGHT SEMI IS_IS...`)\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm not sure this qualifies as a blocker.  "

I then downgraded to VS 2017 but I was not able to get the exact same version.  Microsoft only makes versions 19.10 and 19.15 available for download.  19.10 fails to compile and I am unable to reproduce the failure with 19.15.\r\n\r\nIf the failure is reliable it's possible that there is a hardware mismatch.  The join node makes heavy use of intrinsics and although they are guarded by ARROW_HAVE_AVX2 there might be some odd corner case.\r\n\r\n[~rip.nsk@gmail.com] Do you know what kind of CPU you are running on?\r\n\r\nI'm going to move this from blocker to major."
