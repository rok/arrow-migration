        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15621](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15621). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSubstrait has decided that microsecond resolution timestamps are sufficient.  Arrow has timestamps at a variety of resolutions.\r\n\r\nIf a user is fine casting to microsecond resolution then they don't actually need to do anything.  However, if a user really wanted the source resolution (or maybe the semantics are slightly different around rounding) then we need to create extension types for these in the YAML.",
