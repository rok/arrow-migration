Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor linux wheels use docker, otherwise setup a virtualenv and install the wheel supported on the host's platform. \r\nTesting should include the imports for the optional modules and perhaps running the unit tests, but the import testing should catch most of the wheel issues.",
