        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2928](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2928). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn this build: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cpcloud/crossbow/build/1.0.97 the version of boost that is getting picked up is not correct. We're installing `boost-cpp=1.67.0` from `conda-forge`, but `BOOST_ROOT` is somehow getting picked up as `C:\\Libraries\\boost_1_63_0`.\r\n\r\nWe're setting `ARROW_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` and `PARQUET_CPP_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` correctly.\r\n\r\n`[~kszucs]` `[~wesmckinn]` Do you know if `BOOST_ROOT` overrides setting those other envars?\r\n\r\nI don't think this is the cause of the failing build here, since this build (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kszucs/crossbow/build/1.0.391) passes with that envar set to boost 1.63, but it's still incorrect so we should fix it.",
