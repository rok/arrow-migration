Is it possible for arrow to read in compress delimited files (for example gzip)?\r\n\r\nCurrently I get an error when trying to read in a compressed delimited file:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nvroom::vroom_write(iris, \"iris.csv.gz\", delim = \",\")\r\narrow::read_csv_arrow(\"iris.csv.gz\")\r\n\r\n# Error in csv__TableReader_Read(self) :\r\n# Invalid: CSV parse error: Expected 1 columns, got 4\n```\r\nhowever it can be read in by vroom and readr:\r\n```java\n\r\nvroom::vroom(\"iris.csv.gz\")\r\nreadr::read_csv(\"iris.csv.gz\")\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
