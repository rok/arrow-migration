Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen passing a list of files to the constructor of `pyarrow.dataset.FileSystemDataset`, all files that don't exist are silently dropped immediately (i.e. no fragments are created for them).\r\n\r\nInstead, I would expect that fragments will be created for them but an error is thrown when one tries to read the fragment with the non-existent file.",

At least from the higher level picture, the other talks about _discovery_ (in which case you shouldn't end up with non-existing paths) while this issue about when manually creating a dataset of a list of paths. The fix might still be related though"

The C++ variant only accepts a vector of fragments, maybe we should align both?"

We maybe could still accept a list of paths, if we then only turn them into a FileFragment without checking. In any case we should probably avoid the filesystem interaction with `filesystem.get_file_info(..)`."
