Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyTdLU-RxA-Gsb9EsYnrQrmqPMOYMfPlWwxRi1Is1tQ\r\n\r\nThis will be necessary for ARROW-11928 since some ExecNodes will be constructed with one or more Expressions. For example FilterNodes will evaluate an Expression against their input batches to produce selection vectors.\r\n\r\nThis should probably include factoring out dataset-specific considerations such as allowing input batches diverge slightly in schema. Bound Expressions should refer to their parameters by index so that by-name lookup can be avoided.",
