        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10945](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10945). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\r\nUsecase:\r\nI want to implement a user defined aggregate function that produces more than one column ( logical values)\r\n\r\nSpecifically I am trying to implement the InfluxDB 'selector' functions `first`, `last`, `min`, and `max` as DataFusion aggregate functions.\r\n\r\nI can't use the built in aggregate functions in DataFusion as selector functions aren't exactly like normal aggregate functions \u2013 they return both the actual aggregate value as well as a timestamp. In addition, `first` and `last` pick a row in the value column based on the value in the timestamp column.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I realize I can't elegantly use the built in user defined aggregate framework in DataFusion either. As an example of what is going on here, let's take\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalue | time\r\n-----~~+~~-----\r\n  3   | 1000\r\n  2   | 2000\r\n  1   | 3000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of `last(value)` should be be two columns `1 | 3000` \u2013 however, modeling this as a DataFusion aggregate does not seem to be possible at this time.  Each aggregate function can return a single columnar value but we need to return 2 (the `.value` and `.time` fields).\r\n\r\nIdeally I was thinking that the UDF could produce a Struct (with named field `value` and `time`) but the evaluate function([code])(https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/rust/datafusion/src/physical_plan/mod.rs#L238))returns a `ScalarValue` and at the moment they [don't have support for Structs](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/rust/datafusion/src/scalar.rs#L44)\r\n\r\nI suspect that we would also need to add support in DataFusion for selecting fields from structs\r\n\r\nSee additional detail and context on https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/issues/448#issuecomment-744601824\r\n",
