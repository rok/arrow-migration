Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf there are new groups in the subsequent chunks of a chunked array, the result of Arrow compute hash_min_max is incorrect.\r\nFor example, a table with two chunks, the second chunk has a new group key\r\n```java\n\r\nFirst chunk: {\"argument\": 1, \"key\": 0},\r\nSecond chunk: {\"argument\": 0,  \"key\": 1}\r\n```\r\nthe result of hash_min_max by \"key\" with such data is\r\n```java\n\r\n[{\"min\": null, \"max\": null}, 0],\r\n[{\"min\": 0, \"max\": 0}, 1]\r\n```\r\nBut it should be \r\n```java\n\r\n[{\"min\": 1, \"max\": 1}, 0],\r\n[{\"min\": 0, \"max\": 0}, 1]\r\n```",
