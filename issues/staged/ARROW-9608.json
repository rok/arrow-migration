Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the parquet is installing arrow-flight and it's dependencies, which breaks the CI builds and it's unnecessary because it is not used. Parquet should work without any default features by default. Simple PR will enable building it leaner.",
