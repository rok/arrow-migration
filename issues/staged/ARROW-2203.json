Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe C++ API has support for reading and writing data from and to STDIN and STDOUT. The classes are arrow::io::StdinStream and arrow::io::StdoutStream. It some scenarios it might be useful to write data to STDERR. Adding a StderrStream class should be a trivial addition given the StdoutStream class.\r\n\r\nIf you think a StderrStream class is a good idea, I am more than happy to submit a PR.",
