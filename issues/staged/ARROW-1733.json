Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe validity bitmap and the values for the primitive data would be part of a single allocation, so better heap locality and possibly better performance in aggregate. This same approach is also being worked on for Java",

By keeping the allocations separate, the allocator can ensure that the start of each allocation also is a start of a page. By separating them, we might get performance regressions by having non-page aligned memory for large allocations. Probably having some offset, e.g. size(bitmap) + size(payload) < 8k, could be a solution. Smaller allocations are done at once, larger ones separate. In the end this is all guessing for now, we should test!"
