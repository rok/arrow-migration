        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9039](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9039). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have been saving dataframes into mongodb using:\r\n\r\n`import pandas as pd; import pyarrow as pa`\r\n`df = pd.DataFrame([[1,2,3],[2,3,4]], columns = ['x','y','z'])`\r\n\r\n`byte = pa.serialize(df).to_buffer().to_pybytes()`\r\n\r\nand then reading back using:\r\n\r\n`df = pa.deserialize(pa.py_buffer(memoryview(byte)))`\r\n\r\nHowever, pyarrow is not back-compatible. i.e. both versions 0.11.1 and 0.15.1 can read their own pybytes created by it. Alas, they cannot read each other.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
