Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn CONTRIBUTING.md [1] we should explain that new users need to ask someone to assign them the \"Contributing\" role so that they can self-assign issues in JIRA. It would also be useful to add notes for commuters on how to assign this role to people.\r\n\r\n\u00a0[1]https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md",

Most committers are authorized to do this; if you're a committer and aren't able to load that project admin page, have someone else add you to the necessary role."
