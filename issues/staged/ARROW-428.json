There it would be helpful to pre-allocate an empty DataFrame. But if/how this may work is outside of my knowledge of the Pandas' internals. Multiple threads for the `arrow::Column` -> `pandas.Series/numpy.ndarray` will still be of benefit.\n\nAlso, it is quite common to adhere to the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` for the number of used CPUs. If not this variable explicitly, we want to at least provide a way to limit the currency."
