Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome getOffsetBufferValueCapacity methods uses floating point computation to calculate the capacity, which is not necessary.\r\n\r\n(int) ((offsetBuffer.capacity() \\* 1.0) / OFFSET_WIDTH);\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that JIT cannot optimize away the floating point computations:\r\n\r\n ![image-2019-06-18-20-30-17-826.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12972089/image-2019-06-18-20-30-17-826.png) \r\n\r\nSo this has performance penalty:\r\nBefore:\r\nVariableWidthVectorBenchmarks.getValueCapacity  avgt    5  6.570 \u00b1 0.004  ns/op\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nVariableWidthVectorBenchmarks.getValueCapacity  avgt    5  5.787 \u00b1 0.575  ns/op\r\n",
