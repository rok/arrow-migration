        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4967](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4967). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRun the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport datetime as dt\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame({'foo': [dt.datetime.now()]})\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(dataframe, preserve_index=False)\r\n\r\npq.write_table(table, 'int64.parq')\r\npq.write_table(table, 'int96.parq', use_deprecated_int96_timestamps=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamining the `int64.parq` file, we see that the column metadata includes an object type of `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` and also gives some stats. All is well.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nfile schema: schema \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfoo:         OPTIONAL INT64 O:TIMESTAMP_MICROS R:0 D:1\r\n\r\nrow group 1: RC:1 TS:76 OFFSET:4 \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfoo:          INT64 SNAPPY ... ST:[min: 2019-12-31T23:59:59.999000, max: 2019-12-31T23:59:59.999000, num_nulls: 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if we look at `int96.parq`, it appears that that metadata is lost. No object type, and no column stats.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nfile schema: schema \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfoo:         OPTIONAL INT96 R:0 D:1\r\n\r\nrow group 1: RC:1 TS:58 OFFSET:4 \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfoo:          INT96 SNAPPY ... ST:[no stats for this column]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a bit confusing since the metadata for the exact same data can look differently depending on an unrelated flag being set or cleared.",

But note that this type is actually deprecated in the parquet format.\r\n\r\nSee eg <https://stackoverflow.com/a/54665645/653364>, <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42628287/sparks-int96-time-type> and the discussion in <https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/pull/49>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThat's the explanation for the missing logical type. For the missing stats, I am not sure."

INT96 type is deprecated and it statistics are disabled by default. The timestamp byte layout in INT96 is big endian and does not comply with the standard sort orders in the spec."
