        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2632](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2632). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`ArrowStreamWriter` inherits from `ArrowWriter` the behavior of accumulating an `ArrowBlock` for each `ArrowRecordBatch` that is written. But this data is never used in the context of `ArrowStreamWriter`. \r\n\r\n```java\n\r\npublic abstract class ArrowWriter implements AutoCloseable {\r\n  private final List<ArrowBlock> recordBlocks = new ArrayList<>();\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n\r\n   protected void writeRecordBatch(ArrowRecordBatch batch)  {\r\n      ...\r\n     recordBlocks.add(block);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n`writeRecordBatch` can be overridden in `ArrowStreamWriter` to avoid adding the memory overhead.",
