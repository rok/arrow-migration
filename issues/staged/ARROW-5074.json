Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen installing the Arrow libraries into a system with a prefix (mostly a conda env), the RPATHs are not correctly set by CMake (there is no RPATH). Thus we need to use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in consumers. When packages are built using `conda-build`, this takes cares of that in its post-processing.",
