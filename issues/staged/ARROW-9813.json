Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn gcc, semantic interposition is enabled by default. It can be beneficial to disable it when building Arrow libraries (and it's most certainly harmless anyway).\r\n\r\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35745543/new-option-in-gcc-5-3-fno-semantic-interposition for more background on this.",
