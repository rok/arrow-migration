Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```bash\n\r\ncmake -GNinja -DARROW_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON ..\r\n```\r\nfailed with many boost related error, as below\r\n```bash\n\r\nCMake Error at cmake_modules/BuildUtils.cmake:522 (add_executable):\r\n  Target \"arrow-json-parser-benchmark\" links to target \"Boost::system\" but\r\n  the target was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an\r\n  IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  src/arrow/CMakeLists.txt:114 (add_benchmark)\r\n  src/arrow/json/CMakeLists.txt:28 (add_arrow_benchmark)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error is gone if also build tests `-DARROW_BUILD_TESTS=ON`. Looks boost is not included when build benchmarks.",
