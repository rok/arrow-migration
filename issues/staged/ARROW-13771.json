Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe DirectoryPartitioningFactory already supports this (types are inferred at runtime).  Both factories simply extend KeyValuePartitioningFactory which is doing all the heavy lifting.  This should be pretty straightforward.",

The directory partitioning factory needs names because they cannot be inferred from the filenames.  The fact that the hive partitioning doesn't need names is a good thing and not something we want to undo."
