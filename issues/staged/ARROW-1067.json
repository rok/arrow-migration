Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I run the following (from the docs) python crashes during the pq.write_table statement.  How would I go about writing a parquet file to a file buffer (e.g. for use with Azure Data Lake)?\n```Java\nimport pyarrow as pa\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df, timestamps_to_ms=True)\nwith adl.open(my_file_path, 'wb') as f:\n    output = pa.InMemoryOutputStream()\n    pq.write_table(table, output) # crashes here\n    f.write(output.get_result().to_pybytes())\n```",

There isn't enough information here for me to reproduce the problem.\n\n`pq.write_table(table, f)`\n\nshould work with any Python file-like object, so you can pass the ADL file object directly. If it does not work, let me know. "
