Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer [this discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread/hycr4ghh7csspvm9jyffvqh8qo5koobg), improvements should be considered to reduce friction for first-time contributors through documentation of environment setup, CI checks, code review expectations, etc. Some of this exists scattered in various locations throughout documentation (e.g., language-specific development environments are documented), but it can be difficult to find. The [contributing page](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/contributing.html) has some pointers at the bottom.",

Once these steps pass on your PR, please contact the CODEOWNERS of the relevant part of the source tree for review.\"\r\n \\* \"Discussion takes place on mailing list X.\"\r\n \\* \"The process from raising of PR to release is <snip>.\"\r\n\r\nThe actual situation that played out was as follows:\r\n \\* From VSCode on an M1 Mac, I did not know where to begin to build or test anything, or even if it would work on M1.\r\n \\* I created a Jira account and ticket as directed, and started a PR. (I could not `Start Progress` on the ticket, but this has since been fixed.)\r\n \\*\\* It might be worth mentioning in docs that use of Jira is just standard practice in Apache projects: to me it felt somewhat \"against-the-grain\".\r\n \\* There were some pleasant surprises at this point for which I think the Arrow regulars should be proud of themselves:\r\n \\*\\* response to the Jira ticket was quick;\r\n \\*\\* response to the PR was quick and seemingly automatic: I don't know how awareness of it came about but I soon had constructive comments from people whom I assume to be maintainers;\r\n \\*\\* everyone was very patient and there was no hint of any unsporting comments;\r\n \\*\\* I do not mean to sound in any way patronising in saying all this; I was honestly pleasantly surprised that this large project seems free from inane, low-quality or LKML-tier abusive comments. {**}That's as it should be{**}, but sadly first-time contributors may be bracing themselves for a harsh experience, as I had been.\r\n \\* I did not know how to build or test anything locally; I had never heard of Cython; it's been 20+ years since I last looked at K&R, so the baptism of fire entailed:\r\n \\*\\* make a change, push it, wait a while, see what CI says\r\n \\*\\* repeat\r\n \\*\\* try not to exhaust the patience of the maintainers who showed up.\r\n \\* The code review was meticulous and I appreciated that, because having quickly found myself in unfamiliar territory of C++ and Cython, I would not like to leave anything to a hand-wavey \"oh it's fine\".\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is becoming longwinded so I will try to summarise:\r\n\r\n\"What would reduce friction?\"\r\n \\* Reduce CONTRIBUTING.md to no more than a link to the project website's documentation on contributing. Reduces repetition.\r\n \\* One or both of:\r\n \\*\\* \"Here is a one-shot docker command to perform [a subset of] CI checks locally\"\r\n \\*\\* \"Here is a list of dependencies to install on a virgin dev machine\"\r\n \\* Bonus: \"build a pyarrow test package for your own integration testing as follows...\"\r\n \\* Link to the mailing list archives so that people can quickly see the high quality of the community\r\n \\* Outline how and when to invite maintainers to perform a code review, and what expectations to have of them (are they spare-time volunteers? paid full-time?)\r\n \\* Outline the broad strokes of the release cadence(s) for the project.\r\n\r\n@toddfarmer , hope that helps :)\u00a0"
