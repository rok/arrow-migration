        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6823](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6823). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis might need to wait / could be enabled by the feather v2 (ARROW-5510), but thought to open a specific issue about it: do we want to support saving metadata in feather files?\r\n\r\nWith Parquet files, you can have file-level metadata (which we currently use to eg store the pandas_metadata). I think it would be useful to have a similar mechanism for Feather files.\r\n\r\nA use case where this came up is in GeoPandas where we would like to store the Coordinate Reference System identifier of the geometry data inside the file, to avoid needing a sidecar file just for that.\r\n\r\nIn a v2 world (using the IPC format), I suppose this could be the metadata of the Schema.",

It's probably time for me to take care of the FeatherV2 implementation. It's probably a take of work or less \u2013 I think it is probably doable for 1.0.0"
