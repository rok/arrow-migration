Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDue to PyArrow using libhdfs underneath, it is expected that files read from HDFS are going to make use of short circuit readings.\r\n\r\nHowever, the PyArrow documentation does not explain whether this feature is supported (and on what situations) and if that works without any configuration.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I'm interested in the use case in which we make use of short circuit feature to read some of the columns from a Parquet file located in HDFS into a dataframe.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Presumably if they are configured properly then libhdfs will do them under the hood (since it's using JNI to make Java client API calls)"
