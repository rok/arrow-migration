        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15986](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15986). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParquet modular encryption is now available in the Python Parquet APIs. However, it's not available through datasets, as `ParquetFragmentScanOptions` currently doesn't expose the `FileDecryptionProperties` (it does in C++).",

See <https://docs.google.com/document/d/13EysCNC6-Nu9wnJ8YpdzmD-aMLn4i2KXUJTNqIihy7A/edit#> .\r\nTherefore, before we can expose PME in the new dataset API in Python, there is work needed in the C++ layer, which is being addressed by \u00a0ARROW-13593 ."
