Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTwo main things we could update here:\r\n1. The general description of what the decimal type is and is for and/or a link to the C++ docs - in the details section, add some explanation of what an Arrow `decimal()` type is and why it is automatically mapped to an R `double` type\n1. Documentation of the params precision and scale.\u00a0 We could add a bit more information to explain what that actually means to the user, as it's not immediately obvious.\n   \n   \u00a0",
