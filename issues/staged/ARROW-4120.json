Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome kinds of memory leaks may be difficult to unit test for, and they may not cause valgrind errors necessarily\r\n\r\nI had written some ad hoc leak tests in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/scripts/test_leak.py. We have some more of this in ARROW-3324. \r\n\r\nIt would be useful to be able to create a sort of \"test suite\" of memory leak checks. They are a bit too intensive to run in CI (since you may have to run something many iterations to see whether it leaks), but we could run them in a nightly build",

Otherwise there was no memory leak nor issue with Python references etc.\r\n\r\nI think we should implement tests that check that peak memory use (at least according to what a `MemoryPool` is able to account for) does not exceed a given level. Then we could write better tests"
