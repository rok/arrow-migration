Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should split out Flight tests that don't actually spin up a server/client from ones that do for anticipated work in ARROW-15282. Also hopefully this will make things a little faster to compile since flight_test.cc is extremely large/slow to compile.",
