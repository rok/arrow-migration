Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe clcache cache on AppVeyor has a default max size of 1 GB and can reach close to this size (see e.g. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/build/1.0.7722/job/5gp85w0m5xei0nme#L251). We should limit its size to something more reasonable to lower cache transfer / compression times.",
