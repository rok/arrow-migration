        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7867](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7867). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm not sure if this issue belongs here or to S3FS library.\r\n\r\nThe error occurs when reading from partitioned parquet from S3, in case when the \"root folder\" of the parquet was created manually before writing the parquet there.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI.e. the steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n# 1. Create \"folder\" s3://bucket.name/data.parquet in e.g. cyberduck app\r\n\r\n# 2. Write\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\npq.write_table(table, 's3://bucket.name/data.parquet', partition_cols=[], filesystem=s3fs.S3FileSystem())\r\n\r\n# 3. Read\r\npq.read_table('s3://bucket.name/data.parquet', filesystem=s3fs.S3FileSystem())\r\n# ArrowIOError: Invalid Parquet file size is 0 bytes\n```\r\nIn case when the table was partitioned by a non-empty set of columns, an error reads: \"ValueError: Found files in an intermediate directory\".\r\n\r\nThis is likely due to the fact that S3 does not have \"folders\" per-se, and various software \"mimic\" creation of empty folder by writing an empty (zero-size) object to S3. So the parquet confuses this object with the actual contents of the parquet file.\r\n\r\nAt the same time s3fs library correctly identifies the key as a folder:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ns3fs.S3FileSystem().isdir('s3://bucket.name/data.parquet')  # Returns True\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",
