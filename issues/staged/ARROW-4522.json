Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWebpack is only used in minify-task but I think the same could be done with just terser. The API is documented at https://github.com/terser-js/terser#api-reference. \r\n\r\nTo bundle files, we could switch to the lighter rollup (https://github.com/rollup/rollup), which also supports tree shaking.
