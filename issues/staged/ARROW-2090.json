        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2090](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2090). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd the ability to use python\u00a0`with` syntax on the `ParquetWriter` object.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```python\n\r\nwith pq.ParquetWriter(foo, schema) as writer:\r\n    writer.write_table(table)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this syntax is that it removes the chances of you writing out a partial (invalid) parquet file, which is currently possible if you forget to call the close method, or more likely the close method is not called due to an exception being thrown. \r\n\r\nIt should still be possible to use the previous syntax for backwards compatibility and fine grained control reasons.\r\nSimilarly, the `parquet` module level `write_table` method should be able to use the new syntax without changing previous behaviour.
