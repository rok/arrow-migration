Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe tests in `arrow/r/tests/test-dplyr-funcs-datetime.R` have dates and datetimes tested separately.\u00a0 Given that both I (the person who originally wrote them like that!), and subsequent contributors have ended up accidentally forgetting to test one of these classes, it would make more sense for the tests to just test both at once.",
