        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14403](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14403). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen going through the documentation for building Arrow on macOS I noticed that the \"Minimal debug build with unit tests\" steps failed, throwing an error such as the below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould not find a package configuration file provided by \"GTest\" (requested\r\n version 1.10.0) with any of the following names:\r\n\r\nGTestConfig.cmake\r\n gtest-config.cmake\r\n\r\nAdd the installation prefix of \"GTest\" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set\r\n \"GTest_DIR\" to a directory containing one of the above files. If \"GTest\"\r\n provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been\r\n installed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is fixed by a separate `brew install googletest` call, though that's not super clear from the documentation. Is this something that can be added to the Brewfile, or is that supposed to be as minimal as possible? If not added I think a note in the documentation that extra libraries are required for the debug / test build would be helpful.\r\n\r\nHappy to propose a PR for either approach\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs this something that can be added to the Brewfile, or is that supposed to be\u00a0",
