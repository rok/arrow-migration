        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17776](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17776). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`ArrowReaderProperties` is still marked experimental, but it's pretty well used at this point.\r\n\r\nOne possible change we might wish to make before stabilizing the API for it though: The `ArrowWriterProperties` class uses a namespaced builder class, which provides a nice syntax for creation and enforces immutability of the final properties. Perhaps we should mirror that design in the reader properties?",
