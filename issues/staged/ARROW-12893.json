Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSlice an arrow array can lead to a negative length, when instead it should never be smaller than 0.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\narr = pa.array(range(10))\r\nassert len(arr[-9:-20]) == 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Array.length()` returns `-1` which makes the previous snippet crash as Python never accepts length < 0\r\n\r\nIn particular if you have Python in debug mode it will explicitly fail the related assertion\r\n`Assertion failed: (len >= 0 || PyErr_Occurred()), function PyObject_Size, file Objects/abstract.c, line 61`",
