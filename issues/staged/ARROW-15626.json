Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Read() methods in c_glib/arrow-glib/input-stream.cpp:GIOInputStream can return short when used with a GInputStream that can return short reads (such as a socket), e.g.\r\n```c\n\r\nGInputStream *gis = g_unix_input_stream_new(socket_fd, FALSE);\r\nGArrowGIOInputStream *is = garrow_gio_input_stream_new(gis);\r\nGArrowRecordBatchStreamReader *stream_reader =\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 garrow_record_batch_stream_reader_new(\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GARROW_INPUT_STREAM(is), &gerr);\r\n```\r\nThis causes failure in the RecordBatchReader.\r\n\r\nI have a patch and will post a PR shortly.",
