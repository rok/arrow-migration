        "title": "[Serialization] Fix reference counting of numpy arrays created in custom serialializer",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1695](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1695). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe problem happens with the following code:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pyarrow\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nclass Bar(object):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ndef bar_custom_serializer(obj):\r\n    x = np.zeros(4)\r\n    return x\r\n\r\ndef bar_custom_deserializer(serialized_obj):\r\n    return serialized_obj\r\n\r\npyarrow._default_serialization_context.register_type(Bar, \"Bar\", pickle=False, custom_serializer=bar_custom_serializer, custom_deserializer=bar_custom_deserializer)\r\n\r\npyarrow.serialize(Bar())\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter execution of pyarrow.serialize, the interpreter crashes in the garbage collection routine.\r\n\r\nThis happens if a numpy array is returned in the custom serializer but there is no other reference to the numpy array. The reason this is not a problem in the current code is that so far we haven't created new numpy arrays in the custom serializer.\r\n\r\nI think the problem here is that the numpy array hits reference count zero between the end of SerializeSequences in python_to_arrow.cc and the call to NdarrayToTensor. I'll push a fix later today, which just increases and decreases the reference counts at the appropriate places.",
