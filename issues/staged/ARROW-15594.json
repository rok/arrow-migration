Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now methods like `FlightInfo::Deserialize` require const std::string& which requires an allocation if we're starting with a Buffer. While not a big deal, it would be nice if we could avoid the hit. (This comes up in Flight/UCX since the implementation is done in terms of Buffers.)",
