Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I worked for other items, I found `UnionVector`\u00a0created by `VectorSchemaRoot#create(Schema schema, BufferAllocator allocator)`\u00a0could not keep field type info properly. For example, if we set metadata in `Field`\u00a0in schema, we could not get it back by `UnionVector#getField`.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly because `MinorType.Union.getNewVector` did not pass `FieldType`\u00a0to vector and `UnionVector#getField`\u00a0create a new `Field`\u00a0which cause inconsistent.",
