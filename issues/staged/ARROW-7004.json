Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo avoid evicting objects too early, we sometimes want to bump up a number of objects up in the LRU cache. While it would be possible to call Get() on these objects, this can be undesirable, since it is blocking on the objects if they are not available and will make it necessary to call Release() on them.",
