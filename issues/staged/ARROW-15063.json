Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm assigning the C++ component because this is only relevant to the C++ streaming execution engine.  However, the tool itself need not be written in C++.\r\n\r\nIdeally this tool, given the exec plan log generated by ARROW-15061, the tool will generate some kind of flame chart.\r\n\r\nA basic description of the process should be added to the execution engine docs or in a readme somewhere.",
