Our tests use temp dirs, which are absolute paths, and they pass on Windows just fine. To confirm that it's not an issue of the \"C:\" drive prefix, I modified the test setup [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/tests/testthat/test-dataset.R#L90) to prune the drive, and it still worked:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n> dataset_dir\r\n[1] \"C:/Users/npr/AppData/Local/Temp/Rtmp440fTQ/file13806c8a1ef5\"\r\n> dir.exists(dataset_dir)\r\n[1] TRUE\r\n> no_drive <- substr(dataset_dir, 3, nchar(dataset_dir))\r\n> no_drive\r\n[1] \"/Users/npr/AppData/Local/Temp/Rtmp440fTQ/file13806c8a1ef5\"\r\n> dir.exists(no_drive)\r\n[1] TRUE\r\n> ds2 <- open_dataset(no_drive,  partitioning = schema(part = uint8()))\r\n> ds2\r\nFileSystemDataset with 2 Parquet files\r\nint: int32\r\ndbl: double\r\nlgl: bool\r\nchr: string\r\nfct: dictionary<values=string, indices=int32>\r\nts: timestamp[us, tz=UTC]\r\npart: uint8\r\n> collect(ds2)\r\n# A tibble: 20 x 7\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nReading your error message, it looks like the problem was that \"/data\" does not exist."
