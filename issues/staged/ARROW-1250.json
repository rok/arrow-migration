Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have some subclasses of `pyarrow.lib.DataType`, but we haven't been designing with the intent of writing `isinstance(arr.type, pyarrow.TimestampType)`. We should think about the public API for such type-checking or other type of schema validation. ",

I removed this from the public API because it's too easy to have an unpleasant experience with these types. They are really only for wrapping their C++ counterparts and about the only thing useful you can do with them within Python is type checking. I think these should remain outside of the top level public API and be made public in one module deep (maybe `pyarrow.types`?)."
