        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9778](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9778). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn `tests/sql.rs`, if we re-write the ```execute``` function to test the end schemas, as\r\n\r\n```\r\n/// Execute query and return result set as tab delimited string\r\nfn execute(ctx: &mut ExecutionContext, sql: &str) -> Vec<String> {\r\n    let plan = ctx.create_logical_plan(&sql).unwrap();\r\n    let plan = ctx.optimize(&plan).unwrap();\r\n    let physical_plan = ctx.create_physical_plan(&plan).unwrap();\r\n    let results = ctx.collect(physical_plan.as_ref()).unwrap();\r\n    if results.len() > 0 {\r\n        // results must match the logical schema\r\n        assert_eq!(plan.schema().as_ref(), results[0].schema().as_ref());\r\n    }\r\n    result_str(&results)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe end up with 8 tests failing, which indicates that our physical and logical plans are not aligned. In all cases, the issue is nullability: our logical plan assumes nullability = true, while our physical plan may change the nullability field.\r\n\r\nIf we do not plan to track nullability on the logical level, we could consider replacing Schema by a type that does not track nullability.",

When we construct the logical plan, we do open the source data files and infer the schema (unless a schema is provided) so I would consider this a bug in the logical plan."
