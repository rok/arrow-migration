Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe homebrew-r-autobrew nightly job has been failing since the AWS SDK version was bumped in the autobrew/homebrew-core repo. \r\n\r\nI don't think we can move to this newer version yet due to https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/issues/1809 so I've opened https://github.com/autobrew/homebrew-core/issues/97 to see if Jeroen has better/different ideas about how to work around this.",
