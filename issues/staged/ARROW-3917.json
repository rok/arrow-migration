We might have to think a bit about how to support efficiently appending from strided NumPy arrays",

It's currently working well for me (for legacy reasons the parquet conversion I'm doing is only string-based)"

The challenge here would be to make array building relatively efficient, hence try to expose convenient bulk append methods instead of letting users append one value at a time as they would do in C++."
