        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16746](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16746). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nS3 allows tagging data to better organize ones data (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-tagging.html)> We use this for efficient downstream processes/inventory management.\r\n\r\nCurrently arrow/pyarrow does not allow tags to be added on write. This is causing us to scan the bucket and re-apply the tags after a pyrrow based process has run.\r\n\r\nI looked through the code and think that it could potentially be done via the metadata mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe tags need to be added to the CreateMultipartUploadRequest here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.cc#L1156\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n\r\nhttp://sdk.amazonaws.com/cpp/api/LATEST/class_aws_1_1_s3_1_1_model_1_1_create_multipart_upload_request.html#af791f34a65dc69bd681d6995313be2da",
