Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current implementation of setInitialCapacity() uses a factor of 5 for every level we go into list:\r\n\r\nSo if the schema is LIST (LIST (LIST (LIST (LIST (LIST (LIST (BIGINT)))))) and we start with an initial capacity of 128, we end up throwing OversizedAllocationException from the BigIntVector because at every level we increased the capacity by 5 and by the time we reached inner scalar that actually stores the data, we were well over max size limit per vector (1MB).\r\n\r\nWe saw this problem in Dremio when we failed to read deeply nested JSON data.",
