        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8563](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8563). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis minor change makes newBuilder() public to reduce verbosity for downstream.\r\n\r\nTo give you example, I am working on a parquet read / write into Arrow Record batch where the parquet data types are mapped to Arrow data types.\r\nMy Repo:\u00a0<https://github.com/mindhash/arrow-parquet-go>\r\n\r\nIn such cases, it will be nice to have a builder API (newBuilder) be generic to accept a data type and return a respective array.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI am looking at a similar situation for JSON reader. I think this change will make the builder API much easier for upstream as well as internal packages.",
