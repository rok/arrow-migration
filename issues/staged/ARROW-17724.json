This is due to `is.name((fns))` in the `across_setup()` function evaluating to `TRUE` for `as.character` and `FALSE` for `base::as.character`.  Adding `is.call(fns)` to the list of conditions for identifying single functions may work (needs testing to confirm), or potentially replacing `is.name(fns)` with `is.call(fns)` or another function entirely."
