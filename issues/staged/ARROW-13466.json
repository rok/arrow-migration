Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently if the C++ dependencies cannot be installed, the R package is installed and the user gets a warning `*** Proceed without C++` - however if we update it to fail entirely if that happens, then it'll be more clear to the user that the package install has actually failed\r\n",

Then if/when we solve the Solaris CI issue, we could remove the wrapping altogether."
