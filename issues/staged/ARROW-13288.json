Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[PyArrow is missing the default value of the `stop` option for `SliceOptions`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/_compute.pyx#L798-L800)\r\n \u00a0\r\n [In C++, the default value is `stop = std::numeric_limits<int64_t>::max()`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/api_scalar.h#L205-L206)\r\n\r\nIt is possible for other options to be inconsistent between the C++ and Python APIs, so we need to verify them.",
