Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe often use the 8-4-1 paradigm to compare two blocks of memory:\r\n1. First compare by 8-byte blocks in a loop\r\n2. Then compare by 4-byte blocks in a loop\r\n3. Last compare by 1-byte blocks in a loop\r\n\r\nIt can be proved that the second loop runs at most once. So we can replace the loop with a if statement, which will save us a comparison and two jump operations. \r\n\r\nAccording to the discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5508#discussion_r343973982, loop can be expensive.
