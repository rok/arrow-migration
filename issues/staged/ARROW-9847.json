Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBoth the DataFusion and Parquet crates have a mix of \"import arrow::\" and \"import crate::arrow::\" and we should standardize on one or the other.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhich ever standard we use should be enforced in build.rs so CI fails on PRs that do not follow the standard.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
