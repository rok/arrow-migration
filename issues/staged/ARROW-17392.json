Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've had some pain points when using GDB and the pervasive use of anonymous namespaces throughout the code. I sent out an email on the mailing list and no one seemed to have any opinions, so I am opening this task. This task will gate anonymous namespaces around a `#ifndef NDEBUG` flag (or perhaps make a RELEASE_MODE_ANONYMOUS_NAMESPACE macro of some sort).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMailing list discussion: https://lists.apache.org/thread/61rjzb18mvft7lpwglyh4kq2gkbog4ts",
