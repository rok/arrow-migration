Some possible choices are here:\r\n1. use \"0.11.0.9000\" for development, and \"0.12.0\" for release\n1. use \"0.12.0\" both for development and release (c.f. Apache Spark's SparkR uses this strategy: <https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/9bf397c0e45cb161f3f12f09bd2bf14ff96dc823#diff-06e745873945c43e0e5cf512efa992e9R3>)\n1. use \"0.12.0-0\" for development, and \"0.12.0-1\" for release (c.f [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rstan/)'s patch version is 1-origin)"
