Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow C data interface and C stream interface docs say that these interfaces are only for sharing data within a single process. This is not exactly correct. The fundamental requirement for using the C data interface and C stream interface is\u00a0not\u00a0that the components be necessarily running in the same process. It\u2019s that they are able to pass around a pointer and access the same memory address space. Let's make some minor changes to the docs to clarify this.",
