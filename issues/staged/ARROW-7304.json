        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7304](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7304). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `HeaderFilterRegex` in `.clang-tidy` is written\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nHeaderFilterRegex: '^(.*codegen.*|.*_generated.*|.*windows_compatibility.h|.*pyarrow_api.h|.*pyarrow_lib.h|.*python/config.h|.*python/platform.h|.*thirdparty/ae/.*|.*vendored/.*|.*RcppExports.cpp.*|)$'\r\n```\r\n\r\nas if it was an exclusion filter, but `HeaderFilterRegex` is in fact an inclusion mechanism. So clang-tidy diagnostics are not emitted for I guess most of the headers in Arrow.\r\n\r\nSee <https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/72b553147e4bd47e100fbfd58ed49041561b7bc4#r36225046> which is where I came across this.",

It could duplicate the existing lint exclusions and add any other files which should be ignored. Alternatively if lint_exclusions is sufficiently exclusive then the HeaderFilterRegex field and `.clang-tidy-ignore` can both be deleted."
