Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-7001 needs a sequencing operator to reorder fragments & scan tasks that arrive out of order.\u00a0 This AsyncGenerator would poll source and buffer results until the \"next\" result arrives.\u00a0 For example, given a source of 6,2,1,3,4,5 the operator would return 1,2,3,4,5,6 and would need to buffer 2 items (6 & 2 at the beginning).\r\n\r\nThe Next(T t) will be configurable via function.",
