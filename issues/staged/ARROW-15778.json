        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15778](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15778). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems the Java IPC writer implementation does not emit the Endianness information at all (making it Little by default). This complicates interoperability with the C++ IPC reader, which does read this information and acts on it to decide whether it needs to byteswap the incoming data.",

The way it works at the IPC level is that the writer emits data in whichever endianness it chooses (also setting the corresponding metadata field to the appropriate value) and the reader decides to byte-swap data is required. So it would work similarly at the Flight level."

If it passes current tests, we know it doesn't mess up anything for little endian. Then we could have a separate task to add a proper test with big endian machine, if that requires more effort?"
