Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe partitioned ParquetDataset tests are failing when using s3fs filesystem (I am adding tests in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8573). \r\nI need to come up with a more minimal test isolating the FileSystem.get_file_info behaviour, but from debugging the parquet tests it seems that it is only listing the first level (and not further nested directories/files).",

But I don't remember anymore why it stopped failing while writing that PR. \r\nThe current parquet tests we have also pass with both s3fs 0.4.2 and 0.5.2. \r\n\r\nSo in any case, a possible remaining failure is currently not known / captured by any test. So closing this issue. "
