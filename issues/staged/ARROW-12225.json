Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn a machine with AMD processor, an \"Illegal Instruction\" error occurs directly on \"import pyarrow\", no further information is given.\r\n\r\nThe same setup works on other machines (all of which have various Intel processors). Happy to provide further details, not sure what's needed, any indication what could be the cause are welcome.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nwget <https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh>\r\n\r\nbash Miniconda3_latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\r\n\r\npip install pyarrow -y\r\n\r\npython -c \"import pyarrow\"\r\n\r\n```",

I now ran an \"import pyarrow\" script in \"gdb python\", which seems to work either way (?). Output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(gdb) run test.py \r\nStarting program: /mnt/home/me/miniconda3_amd/envs/slad/bin/python test.py\r\n[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]\r\nUsing host libthread_db library \"/lib64/libthread_db.so.1\".\r\nProgram received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.\r\n0x00007f91998f83fd in _GLOBAL__sub_I_unity_10_cxx.cxx () from /mnt/home/me/miniconda3_amd/envs/slad/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pyarrow/libarrow.so.200\r\n```\r\nAttached are \"bt\" and \"py-bt\" stacktraces (the latter not too informative I guess).   [bt.txt](bt.txt)  [py-bt.txt](py-bt.txt) \r\n\r\nBy the way: I can circumvent the use of pyarrow on this system now, so it's not critical for me if this is too tedious too investigate / does not occur on other systems.\r\n"

It appears this is crashing on a SSE 4.1 instruction, which your processor doesn't support. Our Arrow binaries are compiled with SSE 4.2 enabled. Later AMD processors (post-2012) will work fine."

So I assume this is nothing that will be changed for the official pyarrow binaries? And were one intent on getting it to run on such systems, one would need to compile the library oneself?"
