CMake [picks up LLVM 12 installed by brew](https://dev.azure.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/_build/results?buildId=5114&view=logs&j=cf796865-97b7-5cd1-be8e-6e00ce4fd8cf&t=88ee2fb8-46fd-5c68-fde3-1c8d31ba2a5f) instead of the one installed in the conda build environment. \r\n\r\nWe should sync the build scripts with the upstream feedstock repository which calls `mangle_homebrew`. \r\n\r\n`[~uwe]` since the smithy configuration keeps evolving it's pretty tiresome to remain up to date. Do we have any other option to exercise nightly conda builds by vendoring only the recipe files?"
