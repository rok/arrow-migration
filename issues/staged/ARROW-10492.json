Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAccording to the current implementation of JDBC adapter, the conversion between SQL types and Arrow types is hard-coded. This will cause some problems in practice:\r\n1. The appropriate conversion may vary for different databases. For example, for SQL Server, type `real`\u00a0corresponds to 4 byte floating point values (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/float-and-real-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15),>\u00a0whereas for SQLite, \\`real` corresponds to 8 byte floating point values (<https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-data-types/).>\u00a0If the maping is not right, some extra conversion would happen, which can impact performance severely.\u00a0\n1. Our current implementation determines the type conversion solely based on the type ID. However, the appropriate conversion may also depend some other information, like precision and scale. For example, for `FLOAT( n )`, it should correspond to 4 byte floating point values, if n <= 24, otherwise, it should correspond to 8 byte floating point values.\u00a0\u00a0\n   \n   To address the problems, we should allow users to customize the conversion between SQL and Arrow types.\u00a0",
