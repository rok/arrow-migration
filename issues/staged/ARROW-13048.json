Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi Arrow team,\r\n\r\nwe have the very common use-case of having partitioned parquet tables on S3, written by Spark. These include equals (=) to denote the partition value per folder.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn trying to use PyArrows S3FileSystem `move` function, it's not possible to move these objects in the bucket underneath a path which contains `=` somewhere:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nOSError: When copying key 'table/date=202007/part-00000-e39069c2-0ea6-4a62-85ea-8011047cd4f4.c000.snappy.parquet' in bucket 'bucket' to key 'table2/date=202007/part-00000-e39069c2-0ea6-4a62-85ea-8011047cd4f4.c000.snappy.parquet' in bucket 'bucket': AWS Error [code 133]: The specified key does not exist.\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also not possible to move, using preemptively URL-quoted paths, like these:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nOSError: When copying key 'table/date%3D202007/part-00000-e39069c2-0ea6-4a62-85ea-8011047cd4f4.c000.snappy.parquet' in bucket 'bucket' to key 'table2/date%3D202007/part-00000-e39069c2-0ea6-4a62-85ea-8011047cd4f4.c000.snappy.parquet' in bucket 'bucket': AWS Error [code 133]: The specified key does not exist.\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe source object does definitely exist, it has in fact been returned by a FileSelector from PyArrow itself and is just passed to move.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any configuration option to be set, or special quoting to be used?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nJoerg\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Turning on debug logging, I see that the source key has been double-encoded: \"x-amz-copy-source: foo/a\\*%253D\\*1/foo.parquet\". I also see that Arrow is URL-encoding the source key as required by the SDK. But the SDK itself URL-encodes the source again!
