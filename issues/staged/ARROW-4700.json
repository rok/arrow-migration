        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4700](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4700). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis should be simple to add, since decimals can already be parsed from strings. Decimals will be represented in JSON as strings. If a decimal with different precision or scale is parsed from the string, should there be any acceptable conversions? (for example, if the column is of type `decimal(5, 2)` should `\"12.3\"` be an error or equivalent to `\"012.30\"`?)",
