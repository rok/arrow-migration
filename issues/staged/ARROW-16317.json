        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16317](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16317). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSometimes when trying to use github-actions to submit crossbow jobs an error is raised like:\r\n```java\n\r\nFailed to push updated references, potentially because of credential issues: ['refs/heads/actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp310-amd64', 'refs/tags/actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp310-amd64', 'refs/heads/actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp39-amd64', 'refs/tags/actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp39-amd64', 'refs/heads/actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp37-amd64', 'refs/tags/actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp37-amd64', 'refs/heads/actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp38-amd64', 'refs/tags/actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp38-amd64', 'refs/heads/actions-1883']\r\nThe Archery job run can be found at: https://github.com/apache/arrow/actions/runs/2195038965\n```\r\nAs discussed on this github comment (<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12930#issuecomment-1103772507)>\r\n\r\nWe should remove the auto incremented IDs entirely and use unique hashes instead, e.g.: actions-<short-hash>-github-wheel-windows-cp310-amd64 instead of actions-1883-github-wheel-windows-cp310-amd64. Then we wouldn't need to fetch the new references either, making remote crossbow builds and local submission much quicker.\r\n\r\nThe error can also be seen here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12987#issuecomment-1108516668",
