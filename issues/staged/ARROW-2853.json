        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2853](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2853). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImplementing\u00a0support for zero copy NumPy arrays in libarrow_python (i.e. in C++). We can utilize common code paths with ``to_pandas``\u00a0and toggle between NumPy-for-pandas and NumPy-for-NumPy behavior (and use the `zero_copy_only` flag where needed).",

Let's leave open for now to clarify that we've captured all the use cases. Basically we want a `to_numpy` method that returns a `mask, array` tuple, where the mask will be `None` when there are no nulls, and the array will be a zero-copy readonly view on numeric types"
