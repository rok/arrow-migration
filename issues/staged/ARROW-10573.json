Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow should be able to expose an IPC message as a Pandas dataframe without copying the data. This involves fixing:\r\n \\* the alignment of the IPC message, so all columns of the same type are in contiguous buffers and so can be exposed as the 2D arrays Pandas' block manager expects.\r\n \\* the `arrow_to_pandas.cc` code to make the UX work transparently.",
