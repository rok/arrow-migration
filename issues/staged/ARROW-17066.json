I had thought we would get further along with Substrait then we had.  We should maybe hide the Substrait docs [here](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/cpp/streaming_execution.html#substrait) for the 9.0.0 release then.  They're accurate but somewhat underwhelming and it might be better to advertise nothing."
