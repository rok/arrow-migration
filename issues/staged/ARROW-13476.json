Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, in many places we are not closing or manually invoking `.close()` over resources that could deal automatically with it through context managers. We should replace those manual usages of `.close()` with context managers in the documentation so that we get users used to go for the more robust solution that doesn't require dedicated exception handling and remembering to close things.\r\n\r\n",
