        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-457](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-457). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have a separate `PyArrowMemoryPool` implemented in `src/pyarrrow/common.cc/h`. Instead we should use the default memory pool from Arrow-C++ as often as possible.\n\nFurthermore the user should be able to configure which MemoryPool is actually used in the cases where one can select a custom MemoryPool. For ease of use, there should also be a way to switch the default MemoryPool in Python to a user-selected one, e.g. the `jemalloc::MemoryPool`.",
