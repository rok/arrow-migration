Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm seeing the flatc that's available in Maven foul up users because it depends on a version of glibc (2.14) which is too new for many enterprise Linux users. It would be better for the Arrow Java artifacts to not depend on flatc at all, if possible. \n\nWe could check the compiled sources into source control, but that seems less than ideal. Is there a clean way bundle them at packaging time? ",
