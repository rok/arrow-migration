The dependency on boost::regex was removed in https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/4009b62086dfa43a4fd8bfa714772716e6531c6f#diff-1e87f7c7bac40387242b81ba4969ba6d, so I think you are building 0.9.0 or some version older than that. Please reopen the issue if you can reproduce the error on master"

When starting to prepare a PR, I also found that the issue is gone when using master.\r\nSo, I am good, thanks!\r\nThat said, the current code creates a situation where one subcomponent may affect the whole package. This showed up in 0.9.0. It does not show up in master. However, it might show up in the future. While not knowing all the details, the `else` part of the code under consideration seems redundant, imho."
