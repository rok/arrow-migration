We merged some months ago the C++ and Python documentation as there was a quite an overlap between them and it is forseeable that there will also be a lot of overlap between R, C++ and Python. While using the typical setup for each language may make it easier for contributors to contribute intially to the documentation, it will be harder for Arrow users to navigate across all documentations for specific content.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0"

If there is a need to use RMarkdown we may be able to develop some scripts that process Rmd and include the generated .md files using recommonmark\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rtfd/recommonmark"

R man pages are .Rd format, which is a flavor of TeX. I can't imagine that it's worth our trouble to reimplement everything that `pkgdown` does to parse those and crossreference across those and various other (mostly markdown) pages. Plus, the pkgdown site style is familiar to R users, just as sphinx is for Python users. It's better for the intended audience of the docs.\u00a0\r\n\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/>\u00a0and\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/java/>\u00a0already exist, so it doesn't seem unreasonable to add R to that. We can (and should) have links to those other languages in the sphinx /docs/ ToC sidebar.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
