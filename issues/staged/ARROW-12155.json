        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12155](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12155). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAn error is thrown if the user attempts to create a RecordBatch with different length arrays:\r\n```java\n\r\n> arrow::record_batch(a=1:5, b = 42)\r\nError: Invalid: All arrays must have the same length \n```\r\nBut no error is thrown if the user attempts to create a Table with different length columns. Instead we get garbage in the table:\r\n```java\n\r\nTable$create(a=1:5, b = 42) %>% collect()\r\n# A tibble: 5 x 2\r\n      a         b\r\n  <int>     <dbl>\r\n1     1 4.20e+  1\r\n2     2 6.94e-310\r\n3     3 6.94e-310\r\n4     4 6.94e-310\r\n5     5 6.94e-310  \n```\r\nChange the behavior for Table creation to match the current behavior of RecordBatch creation.",
