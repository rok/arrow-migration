Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using libarrow_minimal, if the dependencies are met, arrow_s3 is always enabled. We should edit [the code block that does this](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/tools/nixlibs.R#L416-L434) such that it respects what's in the env var `ARROW_s3` even if libarrow_minimal is false and the dependencies are satisfied.",
