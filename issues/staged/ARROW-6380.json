        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6380](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6380). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMethod pyarrow.parquet.read_table is very slow and cause RAM spikes from version 0.14.0\r\n\r\nReading a 40MB parquet file takes less than 1 second in versions 0.11, 0.12 and 0.13. wheras it takes from 6 to 30 seconds in versions 0.14.x\r\n\r\nThis impact in performance is easily measured. However, there is another problem that I could only detect on htop screen. While opening a 40MB parquet, the process occupies almost 16GB for some miliseconds. The pyarrow table will result in around 300MB in the python process (registered using memory-profiler). This does not happens in versions 0.13 and previous ones.",
