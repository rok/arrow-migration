Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\npa.array handles iterables fine, but not iterators if size isn't passed:\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> arr = pa.array(range(5))\r\n>>> arr\r\n<pyarrow.lib.Int64Array object at 0x7f4652a05318>\r\n[\r\n  0,\r\n  1,\r\n  2,\r\n  3,\r\n  4\r\n]\r\n>>> arr = pa.array(iter(range(5)))\r\n>>> arr\r\n<pyarrow.lib.NullArray object at 0x7f4633c1d638>\r\n[\r\n\u00a0 NA,\r\n\u00a0 NA,\r\n\u00a0 NA,\r\n\u00a0 NA,\r\n\u00a0 NA\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because InferArrowSize() first exhausts the iterator.",
