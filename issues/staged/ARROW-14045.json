But maybe the path forward is to just implement this anyway, possibly with a warning that it's not guaranteed to take the first value like regular dplyr, or possibly without a warning. (`head()` is also not deterministic as to what rows it takes because of the async evaluation, so that's another difference, but we don't make noise about that.) Even with options to keep nulls, it's not obvious to me that `hash_one` is guaranteed to take the first row, it just takes one row, so seeking exact parity with R might not be feasible. "

I will try to do it the way you suggest.\r\n\r\n> `head()` is also not deterministic as to what rows it takes because of the async evaluation, so that's another difference, but we don't make noise about that.\r\n\r\nI understand that async evaluation is rather a good thing with arrow. I was just thinking about the possibilities since the behavior would depend on implementation.\r\n\r\n> so seeking exact parity with R might not be feasible.\r\n\r\nIt seems difficult now... I'm trying to implement it first. Thank you."
