Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncodegen_internal.h formally defines generator dispatchers and there are a few GDs defined in kernel source files. GDs should be categorized, commented, and renamed appropriately.\r\n\r\nAlso, the documentation for GD should be updated since more capable GDs have been added.",
