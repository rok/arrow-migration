        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4387). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that the tensor interface does not provide access to the Null bitmap data in the underlying array. The root cause appears to be that Data does not have the null bitmap data and associated IsNull / IsValid methods, and tensor only retains the Data and not the Array \u2013 only the array has the actual null bitmap and associated methods. So either keeping the array.Interface around or moving the null bitmap into Data would seem to be the necessary steps.",

I recently tested this in a PR to convert Arrow Tensors to Gorgonia Dense Tensors (<https://github.com/gorgonia/tensor/pull/76>). The null bitmap seems to be working as intended in that situation.\u00a0\r\n\r\n This may just be an old issue that has been fixed since reported or the ask is to make the IsNull and IsValid methods available for tensors.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
