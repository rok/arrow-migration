        "title": "AQE should use available column statistics from completed query stages",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17325](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17325). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn QueryStageExec.computeStats we copy partial statistics from materlized query stages by calling QueryStageExec#getRuntimeStatistics, which in turn calls ShuffleExchangeLike#runtimeStatistics or BroadcastExchangeLike#runtimeStatistics.\r\n\r\nOnly dataSize and numOutputRows are copied into the new Statistics object:\r\n\r\n\u00a0```scala\n\r\n  def computeStats(): Option[Statistics] = if (isMaterialized) {\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 val runtimeStats = getRuntimeStatistics\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 val dataSize = runtimeStats.sizeInBytes.max(0)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 val numOutputRows = runtimeStats.rowCount.map(_.max(0))\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Some(Statistics(dataSize, numOutputRows, isRuntime = true))\r\n\u00a0 } else {\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 None\r\n\u00a0 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to also copy over the column statistics stored in Statistics.attributeMap so that they can be fed back into the logical plan optimization phase. This is a small change as shown below:\r\n\r\n```scala\n\r\n  def computeStats(): Option[Statistics] = if (isMaterialized) {\r\n    val runtimeStats = getRuntimeStatistics\r\n    val dataSize = runtimeStats.sizeInBytes.max(0)\r\n    val numOutputRows = runtimeStats.rowCount.map(_.max(0))\r\n    val attributeStats = runtimeStats.attributeStats\r\n    Some(Statistics(dataSize, numOutputRows, attributeStats, isRuntime = true))\r\n  } else {\r\n    None\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Spark implementations of ShuffleExchangeLike and BroadcastExchangeLike do not currently provide such column statistics, but other custom implementations can.",
