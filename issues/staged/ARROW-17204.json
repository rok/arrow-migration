        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17204](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17204). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently SwissJoin uses 32-bit hash. This means that it will work well only up to around 10M rows in the hash table. Beyond that the hash collisions will keep growing very fast making the hash join impractical to use from performance perspective. Switch to 64-bit hash.",
