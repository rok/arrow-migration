        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8062](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8062). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPartitioned parquet datasets sometimes come with `_metadata` / `_common_metadata` files. Those files include information about the schema of the full dataset and potentially all RowGroup metadata as well (for `_metadata`).\r\n\r\nUsing those files during the creation of a parquet `Dataset` can give a more efficient factory (using the stored schema instead of inferring the schema from unioning the schemas of all files + using the paths to individual parquet files instead of crawling the directory).\r\n\r\nBasically, based those files, the schema, list of paths and partition expressions (the information that is needed to create a Dataset) could be constructed.   \r\nSuch logic could be put in a different factory class, eg `ParquetManifestFactory` (as suggestetd by `[~fsaintjacques]`).",
