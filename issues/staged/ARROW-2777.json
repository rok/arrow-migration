I added Slack b/c\u00a0I've been having synchronous education comms w/ various expert JS framework devs who are curious about Arrow but have questions. Likewise,\u00a0 as\u00a0basic compute fills out over next few months, I expect more beginner q's to start, and an interim period before SO, tutorials, etc. catch up. Slack appeared to be the most \"in-the-open\" sync comms channel being actively used.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMaybe keep now, and\u00a0if/when a decision is made + new path is established, update?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOr clear enough decision that I should delete now, and if so, what should I put instead?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0"

I'm not saying that synchronous communication is a bad idea, but Slack in particular has been actively harmful to the health of the project from what we can see looking at the logs. Very few Arrow committers frequent the Slack channel, and people are heading there because of the general trend of corporations moving a lot of comms out of e-mail and into Slack. \r\n\r\nMy guess is that the Apache project is unlikely to offer an official synchronous communication channel. The best alternative might be to set up a Discourse instance, but we need to see if ASF infra will support it."
