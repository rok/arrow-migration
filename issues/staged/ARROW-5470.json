        "title": "[CI] C++ local filesystem patch breaks Travis R job",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5470](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5470). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3144\u00a0changed a C++ API and required downstream bindings to be updated. Romain wasn't immediately available to update R, so we marked the R job on Travis as an \"allowed failure\". That failure looked like this:\u00a0<https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/538795366#L3711-L3830>\u00a0The C++ library built fine, but then the R package failed to build because it didn't line up with what's in C++.\r\n\r\nThen, the C++ local file system patch (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5378) landed. Travis passed,\u00a0though we were still ignoring the R build, which continued to fail. But, it started failing differently. Here's what the R build failure looks like on that PR, and on master since then:\u00a0<https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/539207245#L2520-L2640>\u00a0The C++ library is failing to build, so we're not even getting to the expected R failure.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the \"C++ & GLib & Ruby w/ gcc 5.4\" build has the most similar setup to the R build, and it's still passing. One difference between the two jobs is that the GLib one has `ARROW_TRAVIS_USE_VENDORED_BOOST=1`, which sounds related to some open R issues, and `boost::filesystem` appears all over the error in the R job.",
