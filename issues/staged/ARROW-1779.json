        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1779](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1779). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is discovered in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1290\r\n\r\nI found one the integration test (nested) failed without zeroing out validity vectors before loading the array from json.\r\n\r\nI have created three files to reproduce this:\r\n(1) nested.json \r\n(2) nested.good (zeroing out validity vector before reading)\r\n(3) nested.bad (not zeroing out validity vector before reading)\r\n\r\n(1) / (2) and (1) / (3) both pass Java integration test, however (1) / (3) fails C++ test - one of the validity vector in (3) doesn't seem to be read correctly.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the issue is because I cannot reproduce an error in Java. I am hoping maybe some one more familiar with C++ could take a look and give some insights what's the wrong with (3). ",

I have the file to reproduce this \r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> good = pyarrow.RecordBatchFileReader(\"/Users/ljin/workspace/arrow/nested.good\")\r\n^[[A\r\n>>> good_batch = good.get_record_batch(1)\r\n>>> good_batch.column(1)\r\n<pyarrow.lib.StructArray object at 0x10c2a3548>\r\n[\r\n  NA,\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': 'BSZRpGI'},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None},\r\n  NA,\r\n  NA,\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': 416507125, 'f2': None},\r\n  NA\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n>>> bad = pyarrow.RecordBatchFileReader(\"/Users/ljin/workspace/arrow/nested.bad\")\r\n>>> bad_batch = bad.get_record_batch(1)\r\n>>> bad_batch.column(1)\r\n<pyarrow.lib.StructArray object at 0x10c0c6b88>\r\n[\r\n  {'f1': -1345581951, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': 'BSZRpGI'},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': -497925054, 'f2': 'E34Dqdr'},\r\n  {'f1': 94270936, 'f2': '5aksGEG'},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': 416507125, 'f2': None},\r\n  {'f1': None, 'f2': None}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey are supposed to have the same data but the bad one doesn't read validity vector correctly. Can you guys help shed some light?\r\n"
