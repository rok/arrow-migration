        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13328](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13328). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13238 ensured that asynchronous dataset scans are internally backed by ExecPlans, allowing easier integration with new ExecNode sinks.\r\n\r\nHowever synchronous scans are still backed by `FilterAndProjectScanTask` and are not consumable using ExecNodes. Ideally, we should route synchronous scans through an ExecPlan as well.",

So while we are running our tests with both the async / sync scanner, I suppose the async one hasn't seen much \"real world\" usage by users?\r\n"
