An example here:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/436731293\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to cut down on the logging.",

I didn't see any recent examples with a failure, but since ARROW-4180 and ARROW-4344 reduced the output quite a bit I think it should be fine now. We probably don't need to output to a log file anymore either. I'll go ahead and close this."
