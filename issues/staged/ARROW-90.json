Please find the details below:\n\nTo enable SIMD support(SIMD being feature of best processor) for power architecture for Apache Arrow, needs to replace \"sse3\" with \"altivec\" flag in \"CMakeLists.txt\".\nPlease find attached patch named \"build_powerSupport_patch\" for the same to support Apache Arrow cpp for Power Architecture.\n\nRegards,\nSonali Shrivastava\nPower Open Source Solutions"

IMO, this should be done intelligently, switching to the other by detecting the underlying CPU arch, please."
