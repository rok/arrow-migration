Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`random()` generates uniform distributed values. We can probably bind that somehow to `runif()` in dplyr (will have to ignore the `n` argument). If nothing else, it can be used to implement `slice_sample()` (see also ARROW-13766, ARROW-13767).\r\n\r\nFWIW there's `sql_random()` in dbplyr, not sure if that's actually exposed meaningfully or just used to implement slice_sample.\u00a0",
