        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15211](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15211). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe convention for the higher-level Arrow data structures (Table, RecordBatch) is to provide a public `Make()` method for creating objects with validation checks. The constructors are set to `protected` and do not perform validation checks, so they should be only invoked with valid inputs. `ChunkedArray` provides both public constructors and `Make()`. We should deprecate the public constructors and be consistent with the other data structures.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the Arrow data structures, [see this discussion](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12036#issuecomment-1002242875).\r\n\r\nNote: The codebase has many statements of the form `std::make_shared<ChunkedArray>(...)` which should be changed to `ChunkedArray::Make(...)`.",

The issue/discussion with ChunkedArray constructor sprouts from ARROW-15194 (see PR for more discussions).\r\n\r\nIn summary, the ChunkedArray long-form constructor was allowing empty and nullptr data type, while the single argument constructor and `Make()` provided checks to prevent this. `Make()` performs an extra validation to ensure that chunks are of the same type but the constructors do not perform this check."
