Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis attribute is currently unused in any Arrow implementation. I think the original idea is that the \"page\" might indicate a particular shared memory page, so that a record batch could be spread across multiple memory regions.\n\nThe downside of this unused attribute is that Buffer metadata takes 24 bytes instead of 16 due to padding.
