        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12696](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12696). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `abandon_ship()`\u00a0function catches errors that occur because of unsupported functions/arguments and issues warnings in place of the of errors. These warnings do not use the same messages as the errors.\r\n\r\nThere are many dplyr tests that use `expect_warning()` to effectively check that an error occurred before it was converted to a warning. These tests do not assert the expected error message, because that message is lost in the conversion to a warning.\r\n\r\nConsider ways to improve these tests to enable them to assert the expected error messages.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, consider:\r\n \\* Whether\u00a0we intend to keep `abandon_ship()` working as it does even after dplyr support in the package becomes more comprehensive\r\n \\* Whether we should modify `abandon_ship()` to incorporate the original error message into the warning it gives instead of throwing a generic and likely less helpful warning message\r\n\r\nSee the related discussion at <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10190/files#r628314240>",
