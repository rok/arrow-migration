Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor multi-configuration generators, the binaries are built into a subdirectory indicating the build configuration.\u00a0\r\n1. In `{}CMakeLists.txt{`}, create a text file, `{}is_multi_config.txt{`}, and place it in the top level build directory. This file should lists the configuration used.\n1. Use this configuration text file in MATLAB test files to ensure they are able to find the MEX binaries.",

The installation step will add the install directory to the [MATLAB Search Path](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/what-is-the-matlab-search-path.html) either directly or by adding a command to the `startup.m` file that is used, by default, on MATLAB start up."
