Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a unit test \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/arrow/arrow-reader-writer-test.cc#L933\r\n\r\nthat reads 1 record at a time from a Parquet-Arrow column reader. There is logic on RecordReader that advances the definition/repetition levels based on consumed data from previous records, but this is inefficient for this case:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/parquet/column_reader.cc#L1011\r\n\r\nThis should be refactored to not require this copying, or at least to only \"shift\" the levels occasionally ",
