Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/3154>\r\n\r\nIn legacy ray, interacting with remote plasma stores is done via plasma manager, which is part of ray, and plasma has a few interfaces to support it - namely Fetch() and Wait().\r\nCurrently the legacy ray code has already been removed, and the new raylet uses object manager to interface with remote machine, and these legacy plasma interfaces are no longer used. I think we could remove these legacy interfaces to cleanup code and avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
