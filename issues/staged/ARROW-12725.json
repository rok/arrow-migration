Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPrevious implementation of hash group by converts input ExecBatches to row-oriented format,\r\nthen hashes and compares rows as if they were a single column.\u00a0\r\nIt is more efficient (especially for small number of key columns) to avoid relatively costly\u00a0\r\nencoding and instead compute hashes of individual columns in column-oriented format mixing them together, and similarly comparing column-oriented data to row-oriented data in the hash table without converting.\u00a0\r\nEncoding only happens for a subset of input rows that are inserted into the hash table - they introduce new groups.\u00a0\r\nKeys in hash table remain stored as row-oriented.",
