Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI found in some routine testing that if I have build C++ libraries with Plasma but do not pass `--with-plasma` or set `PYARROW_WITH_PLASMA` env variable, that the test suite will fail. We should make this optional extension behave like the Parquet extension",
