Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI found that flight-test-integration-client sometimes exits by SIGABRT.\r\nThis problem has been caused at the commit https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/848c803bf162dca2e31cb63fbb3d2f9dbdda460e on the master branch, but the change in the commit seems unrelated to this problem.\r\n\r\nTo investigate this problem, I would like to let this command show the stack trace when it exits by SIGABRT.  It should be done by calling `ArrowLog::InstallFailureSignalHandler` function in the main function.",
