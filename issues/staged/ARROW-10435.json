        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10435). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-10131 `ParquetFileFragment` wraps a FileMetaData, from which all its properties are queried. FileMetaData is emminently serializable, so when pickling a fragment with pre-loaded metadata it would save redundant IO to just serialize the metadata. (An unpickled fragment would then also have pre-loaded metadata.)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8507#discussion_r512698380",
