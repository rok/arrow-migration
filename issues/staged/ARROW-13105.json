Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd bindings for `glue()`. Should behave consistent with `glue::glue()`.\r\n\r\nAlso look at the various other `glue` functions to check if any of them are relevant.\r\n\r\n`glue_safe()` might be relevant and worth implementing.\r\n\r\n`glue_sql()`\u00a0is for formatting SQL queries; that doesn't seem important here.\r\n\r\nI think the `_data` variations of these functions are not relevant here.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any way to implement `glue_col()`\u00a0in Arrow because that's just about the presentation layer.\r\n\r\n`glue_collapse()` and the other `glue` functions that are relevant only in conjunction with `glue_collapse()` should be implemented separately (since they aggregate rows).",
