        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17004](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17004). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\narrow-jdbc can turn JDBC ResultSets into Arrow VectorSchemaRoots. However, it would also be useful to have the opposite: bind values from a VectorSchemaRoot to a PreparedStatement for inserting/updating data.\r\n\r\nThis is necessary for the ADBC project but isn't ADBC specific, so it could be added to arrow-jdbc. We should also document the type mapping it uses and how to customize the mapping.",
