Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGnu libstdc++ is the default c++ library on Linux distros. Clang has its own libc++ implementation, but not used widely.\r\nI found some performance issue when build Arrow with clang but link with gnu libstdc++ (ARROW-12533). \r\nIt's better to add a cmake option to use libc++ when build arrow with clang.\r\nlibc++ is already the default on apple macos: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake#L400",
