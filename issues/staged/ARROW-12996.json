Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe StreamingReader API does not provide a way to detect progress of the stream. It would be useful to have a methods to expose number of bytes read as well as total number of bytes in the csv file so that progress can be calculated.",

The batches returned by the streamer are not equal to the batch size of the reader because the end of a row will not always align with the end of the data. The user could estimate the progress relatively closely as long as the size of rows are not really large like multiple megabytes. The progress indicator would just be a more precise implementation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
