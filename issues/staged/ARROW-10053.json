        "title": "[Rust] [datafusion] Allow integration in non libc environments",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10053](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10053). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDataFusion currently cannot be integrated with codebases which are built for platforms that don't provide a libc implementations. This is because some of the dependencies have features flags enabled which pull in libc linked dependencies.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the datafusion `cargo.toml`:\r\n \\* doesn't define `clap` as an optional dependency (even if `cli` feature is disable its pulled in)\r\n \\* the `arrow` crate has the `prettyprint` feature set\r\n \\* the `parquet` crate doesn't have `default-features` disabled which pull in a libc dependent crate\r\n\r\nIdeally it would be possible to make these feature flags configurable or add a nonlibc feature which disables those. Just to five an idea here's the diff that I'm using right now to allow integration.\r\n```java\n\r\ndiff --git a/rust/datafusion/Cargo.toml b/rust/datafusion/Cargo.toml\r\nindex 71c16576f..e48bc3216 100644\r\n--- a/rust/datafusion/Cargo.toml\r\n+++ b/rust/datafusion/Cargo.toml\r\n@@ -41,14 +41,14 @@ path = \"src/bin/main.rs\" [features]\r\n default = [\"cli\"]\r\n-cli = [\"rustyline\"]\r\n+cli = [\"rustyline\", \"clap\"] [dependencies]\r\n fnv = \"1.0\"\r\n-arrow = { path = \"../arrow\", version = \"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\", features = [\"prettyprint\"] }\r\n-parquet = { path = \"../parquet\", version = \"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\", features = [\"arrow\"] }\r\n+arrow = { path = \"../arrow\", version = \"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\"}\r\n+parquet = { path = \"../parquet\", version = \"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\", default-features = false, features = [\"arrow\"] }\r\n sqlparser = \"0.6.1\"\r\n-clap = \"2.33\"\r\n+clap = { version = \"2.33\", optional = true }\r\n rustyline = {version = \"6.0\", optional = true}\r\n crossbeam = \"0.7\"\r\n paste = \"0.1\"\r\n\r\n```",
