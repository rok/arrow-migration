Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOperators such as GlobalLimitExec, SortExec, and HashAggregateExec (in some cases) require a single input partition. Rather than have these operators perform their own merging of input partitions, the planner should insert explicit MergeExec nodes into the physical plan, when needed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
