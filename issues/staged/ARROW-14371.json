        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14371](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14371). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are a few ways we could make the R-only development guide better (this list isn't exhaustive, but are things that have come up in the discussion here):\r\n\r\n- A note that the brew-based method and the build-your-own methods are incompatible (mostly because of `ARROW_HOME`, but folks using brew shouldn't need to even think about that, so we should be careful how we phrase this)\n- A note about confirming that `brew install apache-arrow --HEAD` completes successfully and how to confirm it's being picked up in the install process\n- This might be part of the point above, but a description of what the difference/meaning of the following are: `*** Using Homebrew ${PKG_BREW_NAME`}, `*** Arrow C++ libraries found via pkg-config`, any mention of `autobrew`. Specifically, if one is trying to use homebrew for development, only the first one is ok, if someone sees something else that means that something isn't quite right.\n  \n  \n  Original ticket description:\n  I cannot get a working install using the [R-only development instructions](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/developing.html#r-only-development). \u00a0\n  \n  Steps I took:\n  1. run\u00a0brew install apache-arrow --HEAD\n  \n  2. run unset ARROW_HOME\n  \n  3. clone arrow repo\n  \n  4. navigate to arrow/r\n  \n  5.\u00a0run R CMD INSTALL .\n  \n  {code:r}\n  (base) dragos@Dragoss-MacBook-Pro r % R CMD INSTALL .\n- installing to library \u2018/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1/Resources/library\u2019\n- installing **source** package \u2018arrow\u2019 ...\n  -

To check this, could you tell me what is the git commit SHA of the checkout that you're using? Is it recent?  \n- The version that brew installed might not have gotten installed correctly / in the right place. Could you show the output of when you run `brew install apache-arrow --HEAD`?

That looks like it's still the release version of libarrow. When I run `brew install apache-arrow --HEAD` I get:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\njkeane@het ~ % brew install apache-arrow --HEAD   \r\n[... homebrew updating]\r\n==> Installing apache-arrow --HEAD\r\n==> cmake ../cpp -DCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG=TRUE -DARROW_FLIGHT=ON -DARR\r\n==> make\r\n==> make install\r\n==> Summary\r\n\ud83c\udf7a  /usr/local/Cellar/apache-arrow/HEAD-62ff659_4: 562 files, 132.3MB, built in 8 minutes 11 seconds\r\njkeane@het ~ % \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then when I look in that directory, I'm seeing files marked 600:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\njkeane@het apache-arrow % ls -lah /usr/local/Cellar/apache-arrow/HEAD-62ff659_4/lib\r\ntotal 257744\r\n...\r\n-r--r--r--   1 jkeane  admin    20M Oct 19 10:15 libarrow.600.0.0.dylib\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it looks like where the install process is looking for libarrow is finding an old (release) version of libarrow still. Is it possible that when you ran `brew install apache-arrow --HEAD` there were linking errors? Could you try again and see what filepath it installs to and confirm that that has files in it that are **.600.**?"

Let's open a separate Jira for this issue (or see if there's already one around, I looked briefly and didn't find anything) to see if we can update the brew formula for apache-arrow to not need something pre-installed like this. We can also tag folks who know better about packaging + python packaging there and get their help with what the right way to deal with this kind of mismatch is."
