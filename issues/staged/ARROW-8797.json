        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8797](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8797). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis PR is derived from discussion in ARROW-8790. The current implementation of the Flight RPC exchanges messages using a native endlian format. It does not allow us to exchange data though Flight RPC among different endian machines (e.g. x86_64 <-> s390x).\r\n\r\nThere is a field to show an endianness at[\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Schema.fbs#L343-L346](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Schema.fbs#L343-L346), which is added by ARROW-245.",

In my opinion, we may have two opinions to exchange data between different endian platforms.\r\n\r\n1. Exchange data using native endian. If the receiver detects the message endian is different from the machine-native endian, the receiver converts endian.\r\n2. The FlightRPC always use the specific endian regardless of endian of sender or receiver.\r\n\r\nIs there any comment?"
