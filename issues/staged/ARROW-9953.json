Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe DESCRIPTION file lists -\r\n\r\n`\u00a0Imports:`\r\n\u00a0`\u00a0 assertthat,`\r\n\u00a0`\u00a0 bit64,`\r\n\u00a0`\u00a0 ...`\r\n\r\nHowever for us (R3.4 over linux, with various old package versions installed) the installation fails. The error message is\r\n\r\n`Error : object 'str.integer64' is not exported by 'namespace:bit64'`\r\n `ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'arrow'`\r\n\r\n\u00a0We believe that 'bit64' in the Imports section should have been 'bit64 (>= 0.9-7)', as previous versions of bit64 do not export 'str.integer64'.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Would you like to submit a pull request to add this? [bit64 version 0.9-5 is from 2015](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/bit64/), so that's probably why we haven't encountered this before."
