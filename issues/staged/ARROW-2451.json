Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now certain dtypes like bool or fixed length strings are serialized as lists, which is inefficient. We can handle these more efficiently by casting them to uint8 and saving the original dtype as additional data.",
