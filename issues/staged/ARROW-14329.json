I think `[~sakras]` fixed several of these.\r\n\r\n`StopProducing` is still a little bit clunky however.  The merge generator doesn't pass the cancellation down to the readers and so read operations may continue to read for some time after the call and I think it may be possible that some memory is leaked."
