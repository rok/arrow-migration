Note that **Arithmetic Options** are not passed as a parameter to **CallFunction**, so you may think about it as a meta-option.\r\n \\* **checked** variants trigger error on overflows\r\n \\* non-checked variants may wrap around\r\n\r\n[In R bindings, arithmetic functions (**checked** or not) are mapped directly](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/R/expression.R#L29-L43)."
