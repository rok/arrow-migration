Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`pyarrow.substrait.run_query()` only accepts a PyArrow buffer, and will segfault if something else is passed. People might try to pass a Python bytes object, which isn't unreasonable. For example, they might use the value returned by protobufs `SerializeToString()` function, which is Python bytes. At the very least, we should not segfault.",
