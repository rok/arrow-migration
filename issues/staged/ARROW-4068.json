Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to package Gandiva with Python wheels and conda packages on macOS, it would be useful to build and run on Xcode 6.4 if it is not too difficult. I am not sure what are the plans for upgrading past Xcode 6.4 in conda-forge",
