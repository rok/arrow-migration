Does it make sense to create expect_dplyr_named()? (i.e. to mimic https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-mutate.r#L56-L59)\r\n\r\n2. Does it make sense to create expect_dplyr_identical() (i.e. to mimic https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-mutate.r#L61-L69 and https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-mutate.r#L83-L91)\r\n\r\n3. Should we need to add glue to Suggests? (i.e. replicate https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-mutate.r#L95-L100)\r\n",

A concrete example + an implementation of those would be helpful in evaluating if those are helpful."

There's also ARROW-10959 which is the C++ implementation (and ARROW-11514 for the R bindings). Though even once those are done, we might still need more work to get this working. This is probably big enough to need a ticket on its own if we're going to do it."
