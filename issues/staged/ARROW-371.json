Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm testing round-trip of pandas DataFrame to arrow Table and back.\n\nConverting a pandas DataFrame with pd.Timestamp columns and NaT entries to a Table seems to work fine (null count and data type of the column match expectations). However, converting the Table back to a DataFrame represents the column as float64, not as pandas.Timestamp/numpy.datetime64[ns] as expected.",
