        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12918](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12918). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `test-build-vcpkg-win` CI job uses the current\u00a0`windows-2019`\u00a0GHA runner image, so it often catches build errors caused by Visual Studio/MSVC updates.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio version in this image was just updated from\u00a0**16.** **9.31229.75** to\u00a0**16.10.31321.278**\u00a0and the MSVC runtime was updated from\u00a0**14.** **28.29914**\u00a0to **14.29.30037**\u00a0as shown at\u00a0<https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/pull/3452/files)>. This seems to have triggered a new error:\r\n```java\n\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.29.30037\\include\\xutility(1232,54): error C2794: 'reference': is not a member of any direct or indirect base class of 'std::iterator_traits<_Iter>' [D:\\a\\crossbow\\crossbow\\arrow\\cpp\\build\\src\\arrow\\arrow-stl-test.vcxproj]\r\n          with\r\n          [\r\n              _Iter=arrow::stl::ArrayIterator<arrow::BaseBinaryArray<arrow::BinaryType>,arrow::stl::detail::DefaultValueAccessor<arrow::BaseBinaryArray<arrow::BinaryType>>>\r\n          ] \n```\r\nFull log: <https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/2716032508>\r\n\r\nLog from the same CI job just before this update, showing no errors:\u00a0<https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/2708195132>\r\n\r\nThere are no apache/arrow commits or vcpkg port updates changes that would explain this error so I strongly suspect it was caused by the Visual Studio update.",
