Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen building on M1 gRPC is not found. It can be [manually downloaded](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/grpc/protoc-gen-grpc-java/1.41.0/protoc-gen-grpc-java-1.41.0-osx-x86_64.exe) and installed:\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\nmvn install:install-file -DgroupId=io.grpc -DartifactId=protoc-gen-grpc-java -Dversion=1.41.0 -Dclassifier=osx-aarch_64 -Dpackaging=exe -Dfile=/Users/<user>/Downloads/protoc-gen-grpc-java-1.41.0-osx-x86_64.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut perhaps that could be fixed as suggested here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/7690",
