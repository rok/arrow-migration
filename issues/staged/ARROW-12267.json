Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLooks like the json writer.rs code in arrow doesn't support writing out timestamps. When I tried to write out a `TimestampNanosecondArray` I got the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'influxdb_ioxd::http::tests::test_query_json' panicked at 'Unsupported datatype: Timestamp(\r\n    Nanosecond,\r\n    None,\r\n)', /Users/alamb/.cargo/git/checkouts/arrow-3a9cfebb6b7b2bdc/3e825a7/rust/arrow/src/json/writer.rs:326:13\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\r\n```\r\n",
