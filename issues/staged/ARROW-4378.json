        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4378](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4378). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimilar to the way that\r\n```java\n\r\nGet(const std::vector<ObjectID>& object_ids,\u00a0int64_t timeout_ms, std::vector<ObjectBuffer>* out)\n```\r\n\u00a0releases the object when the shared_ptr<PlasmaBuffer> inside of ObjectBuffer goes out of scope, the same should happen for\r\n```Java\n\r\n  Status Create(const ObjectID& object_id, int64_t data_size, const uint8_t* metadata,\r\n                int64_t metadata_size, std::shared_ptr<Buffer>* data);\r\n```\r\nAt the moment people have to remember calling Release() after they created and sealed the object and that can make the use of the C++ API cumbersome.\r\n\r\nThanks to `[~anuragkh]` for reporting this.",
