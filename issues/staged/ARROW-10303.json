Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when the CSV file is read, a single thread is responsible for reading the file and for transformation of returned string values into correct data types.\r\n\r\nIn my case, reading a 2 GB CSV file with a dozen of float columns, takes ~40 seconds. Out of this time, only ~10% of this is reading the file,\u00a0 and ~68% is transformation of the string values into correct data types.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to parallelize the part responsible for the data type transformation.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be quite simple to achieve since after the CSV reader reads a batch, all projected columns are transformed one by one using an iterator over vector and a map function afterwards. I believe that if one uses the rayon crate, the only change will be the adjustment of \"iter()\" into \"par_iter()\" and\r\n\r\nchanging\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#0033b3\">impl</font><<font color=\"#20999d\">R</font>: <font color=\"#000000\">Read</font>> <font color=\"#000000\">Reader</font><<font color=\"#20999d\">R</font>>\r\n\r\ninto:\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#0033b3\">impl</font><<font color=\"#20999d\">R</font>: <font color=\"#000000\">Read </font>+ <font color=\"#000000\">std</font>::<font color=\"#000000\">marker</font>::<font color=\"#000000\">Sync</font>> <font color=\"#000000\">Reader</font><<font color=\"#20999d\">R</font>>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut maybe I oversee something crucial (as being quite new in Rust and Arrow). Any advise from someone experienced is therefore very welcome!",
