I just started working on it last week after I realized it had been released, you can see my branch here:\n https://github.com/ccri/arrow/tree/flatbuf-typescript. Unfortunately, I ran into what looks like a bug in the TS generator and filed an issue: https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/4365"
