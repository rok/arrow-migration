        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-823](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-823). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPractically speaking, this would involve a \"custom\" logical type that is \"pyobject\", represented physically as an array of 64-bit pointers. On serialization, this would need to be converted to a BinaryArray containing pickled objects as binary values\n\nAt the moment, we don't yet have the machinery to deal with \"custom\" types where the in-memory representation is different from the on-wire representation. This would be a useful use case to work through the design issues\n\nInterestingly, if done properly, this would enable other Arrow implementations to manipulate (filter, etc.) serialized Python objects as binary blobs.

While this will not fully solves the issue, I think that discussion is one of the requirements."

It's not obvious that putting Python objects in an Arrow array would bring a tangible improvement."
