        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6386](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6386). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo my knowledge, there isn't explicit documentation on how null slots in an array should be interpreted. SQL uses Kleene logic, wherein a null is explicitly an unknown rather than a special value. This yields for example `(null AND false) -> false`, since `(x AND false) -> false` for all possible values of x. This is also the behavior of Gandiva's boolean expressions.\r\n\r\nBy contrast the boolean kernels implement something closer to the behavior of NaN: `(null AND false) -> null`. I think this is simply an error in the boolean kernels but in any case I think explicit documentation should be added to prevent future confusion.\r\n\r\n",
