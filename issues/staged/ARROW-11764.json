Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems like the `build.rs` was not included in the package when devs were publishing the crate to crates.io. And that is why the `simd` feature no longer works.\r\n\r\nBecause in the 2.0.0 `#[cfg(all(..., feature = simd))]` attribute was used and in version 3.0.0 it was upgraded to `#[cfg(simd)]`.",
