Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAnother aggregate function we\u2019ll need to look at is median().\r\n\r\nThat should in theory map to the existing quantile kernel and the hopefully-coming-soon hash_quantile kernel with  q = 0.5, but that will not work right now for several reasons (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13309).\r\n\r\nHowever we also have a pair of\r\n approximate quantile kernels: tdigest and hash_tdigest that we could map median() to.",
