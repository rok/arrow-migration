Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen originally reviewing the code I suggested a new VectorSchemaRoot on each call to the iterator.\u00a0 After further discussions on the mailing list, it seems that this is an anit-pattern for working with VectorSchemaRoot, we should update the code to update a single VectorSchemaRoot.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter this change it should be easier to use Avro converter with other components of the library (i.e. filewriter) which also make use of a single VectorSchemaRoot.",
