It turns out that ubuntu is missing the timezone setup and adding the following line to the docker file fixes the problem:\r\n```java\n\r\nrun DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive TZ=Etc/UTC apt-get -y install tzdata \n```\r\nFixed in the docker code, but I'm not sure given this whether this is a bug in pyarrow or not\u00a0 - the code I'm running is pretty simple and doesn't have a functional dependency on the local timezone, so I don't think it should fail if the timezone hasn't been set up, but I have to admit, it's pretty basic functionality."

Not sure if Arrow can do much about that. Possibly thrown from here: <https://github.com/apache/orc/blob/0c4dbaaad036989e34d84d547bca9bc342d4883e/c%2B%2B/src/Timezone.cc#L689-L707>"
