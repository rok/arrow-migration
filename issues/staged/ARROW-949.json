Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nflatbuffers recently [merged a PR](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/pull/4232) that adds support for TypeScript. We should start using it once the capability is available in a released version.\nIt could also be good to try it out pre-release in case the arrow schemas reveal any bugs in the new implementation.",
