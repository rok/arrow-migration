        "title": "[C++][Dataset] Parsing statistics of Parquet FileMetadata is expensive",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9730](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9730). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom a discussion in dask (https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/6346/#issuecomment-656548675), we noticed that parsing all the statistics of a larger dataset is quite time consuming.\r\n\r\nNow, it might be that this is already optimized and one simply needs to live with the cost of parsing statistics if you want the benefit of those statistics for row group filtering. But, it might be worth profiling this to ensure there is not actually some performance bug / low hanging fruit lying around.\r\n\r\n**Example timing:**\r\n\r\nI was testing locally with a part of the NYC taxi data (for 2.5 years (2016-07 - end 2018), one file per month, total disk size of 4.3 GB):\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> import pyarrow.dataset as ds \r\n>>> dataset = ds.dataset(\"notebooks-arrow/nyc-taxi-data/original-partitioned/\", format=\"parquet\", partitioning=[\"year\", \"month\"]) \r\n>>> fragments = list(dataset.get_fragments()) \r\n>>> len(fragments) \r\n30\r\n>>> %time [frag.ensure_complete_metadata() for frag in fragments] \r\n```\r\n\r\nTiming results of the last line of master vs commenting out parsing statistics when collecting the metadata:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nIn [5]: %time [frag.ensure_complete_metadata() for frag in fragments] \r\n# master\r\nCPU times: user 4.22 s, sys: 75.4 ms, total: 4.3 s\r\nWall time: 4.41 s\r\n\r\n# master but with parsing statistics commented out (still reading the FileMetadata and row group information for num_rows, total_byte_size)\r\nCPU times: user 377 ms, sys: 4.47 ms, total: 381 ms\r\nWall time: 404 ms\r\n\r\n```",

Maybe there is still room for improvement, but then that has been the case for ParquetDataset before as well. So as long not something more specific concern is raised, we can close this."
