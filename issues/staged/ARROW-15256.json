Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now we have to manually instrument code; preserving span linkage across async boundaries is consequently rather painful. Based on this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11964#discussion_r778512018) we could instead instrument Executor/Future and have them try to propagate the active span instead so that we don't have to do things manually.",
