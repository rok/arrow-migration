Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-13168, we enabled a runtime option to set the location of the timezone database on Windows. For developers, the unit tests read the ARROW_TIMEZONE_DATABASE environment variable. It might be helpful for users to let them use that variable, but the question is where to put the initialization. Also, should it have precedent over the initialize method? If it did, it could override the R initialization that points to the tzdb package.",
