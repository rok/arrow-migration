Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow we have two list vectors: `ListVector`\u00a0and `FixedSizeListVector`.\r\n\r\n`ListVector` has already implemented UnionListWriter for writing data, however, `FixedSizeListVector` doesn't have this yet and seems the only way for users to write data is getting inner vector and set value manually.\r\n\r\nImplement a writer for `FixedSizeListVector` is useful in some cases.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
