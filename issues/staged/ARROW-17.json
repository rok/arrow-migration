Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDrill has methods for serializing and deserializing value vectors, and this functionality was not included in the code checked into the Arrow repo. It was kept in drill. For these Drill methods to work, some private vector fields need to be made package level so that the Drill helper methods can access them.",
