        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14338](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14338). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Python and C++ documentation have support for serving multiple versions of the docs and switching between them thanks to the newly added version switcher. The same doesn't apply to the R docs as they are not implemented in Sphinx and thus can't benefit from the version switcher implemented for Sphinx.\r\n\r\nWe should provide an equivalent version switcher for the R docs.\r\n\r\nWe are already hosting multiple versions of the R docs:\r\n \\* Stable:\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/>\r\n \\* Dev:\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/>\r\n \\* Old releases:\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/5.0/r/>\u00a0etc.\r\n\r\nSo the need is simply for a UI element to enable users to easily navigate between these.\r\n\r\nRelevant pkgdown issue: <https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1373>\r\n\r\nPossible implementation ideas:\r\n - <https://insightsengineering.github.io/r.pkg.template/> does it with a dropdown in the main header, I suppose that's something we could do as well (although that would be some manual work to update it in `_pkgdown.yml` before each version)\r\n - from `[~icook]`: I don\u2019t have an example of extra.js being used specifically for version switching, but we already have an extra.js we\u2019re using for a different purpose: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/pkgdown/extra.js>. I believe it would be relatively straightforward to use jQuery to replace the static version `<span>` which looks like this\r\n```java\n\r\n<span class=\"version label label-default\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"\" data-original-title=\"Released version\">6.0.1</span>\n```\r\nwith a `<select>` that would allow users to navigate to other versions of the R docs\r\n\r\nIf it is necessary to hard-code R package versions in a file to achieve this, then we could automate the updating of these hard-coded versions at each release through\u00a0[dev/release/utils-prepare.sh](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/utils-prepare.sh), and add a test confirming the update at\u00a0[dev/release/01-prepare-test.rb](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/01-prepare-test.rb).",
