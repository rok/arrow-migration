        "title": "[C#] Array builders to use bit-packed buffer builder rather than boolean array builder for validity map",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8788](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8788). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe C# array builders were recently enhanced to have support for adding nullable values easily, under [PR #7032](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7032).\r\n\r\nHowever, the builders internally referenced `BooleanArray.Builder`, which itself then had logic \"baked-in\" for efficient bit-packing of boolean values into a byte buffer.\r\n\r\nIt would be cleaner for there to be a general-purpose bit-packed buffer builder, and for all array builders to use that for their validity map.  The boolean array builder would use it twice: once for values, once for validity.",
