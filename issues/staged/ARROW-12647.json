But do we want such handling of a projection schema at the C++ level? (or is there already functionality available?)\r\n\r\nDataset has a `ReplaceSchema`, which is a bit similar in purpose, but at the Dataset level and using a different logic about what casting is acceptable (using `CheckProjectable`)  compared to projecting while scanning (this might be something to clean up / make consistent)"
