We're mapping arrow null types to float64 because of nans, but I don't think that's correct since null is both tye type of typeless missing values _and_ the type of empty things, including the value type for empty lists and maps. Really the `pandas_type` should be `'empty'`.\r\n2. The C++ `table_to_blocks` function doesn't actually support null types"
