Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCould you please update the pip latest version 20.1\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/2688a62f8179f20c20c06a10fcd22fe8a714ae48/python/manylinux1/scripts/requirements.txt>\r\n\r\nCVE-2018-20225\r\nAn issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number).",
