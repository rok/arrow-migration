Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArchery already have a couple of utilities to parse commits between revisions and access various metadata from git. Implementing it python would make it more portable (e.g. `date` function is different from `GNU date` on macOS).\r\n\r\nWe can more easily filter out the noisy author/committer data as well.",
