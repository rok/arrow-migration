It also removes the debug fields in ledger (buffers, historical log) to a different class.\r\n\r\nRunning a test that does 20000 allocations of arrow bufs and with ravindra's ongoing fix that does the slicing of arrow bufs, below are the results (without/with above fix)\r\nWithout\u00a0above\u00a0fix :\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Total Bytes: 13,028,109\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Total Classes: 2,367\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Total Instances: 193,471\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Classloaders: 77\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GC Roots: 1,641\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Number of Objects Pending for Finalization: 0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWith\u00a0above\u00a0fix :\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Total Bytes: 12,700,115\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Total Classes: 2,373\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Total Instances: 193,635\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Classloaders: 82\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GC Roots: 1,642\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Number of Objects Pending for Finalization: 0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nArrowBuf size decreased from 109 bytes to 88 bytes and BufferLedger size increased from 80 bytes to 89 bytes.",
