Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a number of spoken and unspoken guidelines around argument passing \u2013 some of them are codified in the Google style guide while others (e.g. use of smart pointers as function arguments) are applied via convention and enforced in code reviews. \r\n\r\nI propose to add a section to make each case explicit so that our code can become more hygienic and our code reviews less intense",
