Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI think there is a bug in the ORC reader : when we specify the fields indexes that we want to keep, it does not work correctly. Looking at the code, it seems to be because we do \"includeTypes\" in lieue of \"include\" when setting the ORC options.\r\nIt can be problematic when we want to import an ORC table containing Union types as it will do an error at the import, even if we try not to import these specific fields.\r\n\r\nThe definitions of the corresponding ORC methods are here :\r\n<https://github.com/apache/orc/blob/72220851cbde164a22706f8d47741fd1ad3db190/c%2B%2B/src/Options.hh#L185-L191>\r\n\r\nand\r\n<https://github.com/apache/orc/blob/72220851cbde164a22706f8d47741fd1ad3db190/c%2B%2B/src/Options.hh#L201-L207>",
