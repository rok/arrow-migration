Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBallista was added to CI in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9979> but is building without default features due to snmalloc requiring cmake.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach would be to build with cc instead of cmake. See the above PR for conversation about this.",
