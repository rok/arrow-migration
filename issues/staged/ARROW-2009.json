Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome systems may wish to send 32- or 64-bit decimal values on the wire without any conversions. Computations engines using Arrow may choose to promote these to 128-bit right away on receipt, but it would be useful to be enable systems with native handling of the smaller-size types to be able to send data via Arrow streams / IPC without extra serialization",
