The libparquet-dev packages uses 0.11.0 as its version.\r\n\r\n0.11.0 is less than 1.4.1. So libparquet-dev packages for apache/parquet-cpp was preferred.\r\n\r\nI've removed all libparquet-dev packages for apache/parquet-cpp from packages.red-data-tools.org. Now, you can install libparquet-dev for Apache Parquet C++ in Apache Arrow 0.11.0 by default.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWorkaround: You can force to install the specified version by `sudo apt install -y -V libparquet-dev=0.11.0-1`."
