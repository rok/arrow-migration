        "title": "[Rust] [Flight] Upgrade to tonic > 0.3.1 to get fix of headers/trailers handling",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10961). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nC++ gRPC servers sometimes return both headers and trailers, and [tonic](https://crates.io/crates/tonic), the crate that provides a Rust gRPC implementation, wasn't correctly merging headers and trailers for errors in the gRPC client. [This has been fixed](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/pull/510) and should be included in the next release of tonic, which should have some version number greater than 0.3.1, but I'm not sure what tonic's release plans are.\r\n\r\nIn the Rust Flight integration test client I'm developing, the middleware scenario with the Rust client against the C++ server will fail until this is taken care of. Filing this ticket so I can reference it in the disabling of that test case.",
