Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've realised that we have a config file for read the docs:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/9f4c632fa9a22f7f0ea793b9bc40d9ee8d8ffad7/.readthedocs.yml>\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a pretty old configuration when pyarrow docs were hosted there. It seems there are still some docs there:\r\n\r\n<https://pyarrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html>\r\n\r\nThis ticket aim is to remove this file config and if possible remove it from read the docs.",
