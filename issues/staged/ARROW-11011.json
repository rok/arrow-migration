Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOnce https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10582 is implemented, we should add support for hash partitioning. The logical physical plans already support create a plan with hash partitioning but the execution needs implementing in repartition.rs\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs part of this issue, we should remove the following comment from the logical and physical Partitioning enum:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n/// This partitioning scheme is not yet fully supported. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11011 \n```\r\n\u00a0",
