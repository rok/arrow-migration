        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3459](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3459). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGandiva can currently handle variable length input vectors but requires the output vectors to be fixed-length. This is because we do not have a handle to allocate or resize arrow vectors from inside the LLVM code. Due to this limitation, we are not able to support a lot of utf8 related functions (convert-numeric-to-string, toupper, strstr, replace, ..).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis needs to be fixed for both C++ and Java.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
