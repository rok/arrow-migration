        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11605](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11605). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith all our crates now supporting stable Rust, we can decide on a Minimum Supported Rust Version, so that we don't introduce breakage to people relying on older Rust versions.\r\n\r\nWe could:\r\n- Determine what the earliest Rust version that compiles is (at least 1.39 due to async in DF)\n- Use this version in CI\n- Decide on, and document, a policy for how we update versions\n  \n  This might mean that when there's fresh new changes landing in Stable, we'd likely hold off on them until those changes meet our MSRV.\n  \n  Thoughts `[~Dandandan]` `[~alamb]` `[~jorgecarleitao]` `[~andygrove]` `[~paddyhoran]` `[~sunchao]`?",
