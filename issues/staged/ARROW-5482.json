Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn some scenarios, we hold lots of value vectors in memory eg. during join, aggregation. The heap analysis shows that the costs are as follows for a simple IntVector (used VisualVM on mac) :\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIntVector : 80 bytes\r\n\r\nvector.types.pojo.FieldType : 41 bytes\r\n\r\nvector.types.pojo.Field : 40 bytes\r\n\r\nIntReaderImpl : 28 bytes\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'll use this Jira to track ways to reduce the heap usage.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
