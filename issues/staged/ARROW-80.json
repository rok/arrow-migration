Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen creating an Array with no underlying storage (do we want to allow this?), i.e. before init is called, len will run into a segmentation fault.\n\nThis is especially annoying if you only want to try it out in an ipython shell and the line `pyarrow.array.Array()` directly crashes as IPython tries to print the repr.\n\n\n\n",
