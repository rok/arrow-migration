Even after upgrading with pip3 -U \r\ninstall pip still same.\u00a0 Shouldn't we change it in python/setup.py file \r\nbefore importing that Cython would be required. As my system doesn't \r\nrequire Cython by default.\r\n\r\nI'll still test it on latest versions to see if issue gets resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: installing with Python2.x based pip it works but only fails for \r\npython3.x based pip.\r\n\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\nRajshekhar\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I recommend that you switch to using virtualenv or conda environments for installing. This makes you independent of the `pip`\u00a0version of your distribution."
