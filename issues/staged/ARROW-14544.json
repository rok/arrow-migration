(As exceptions, packages in a \u2018VignetteBuilder\u2019 field are always made available.) Default: false (but true for CRAN submission checks: some of the regular checks use true and some use false).\r\n\r\n_R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_: As for _R_CHECK_SUGGESTS_ONLY_ but using only Depends/Imports (and the exceptions, including test-suite managers in \u2018Suggests\u2019). Default: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, the description in the README linked to above says \"tests on x86_64 Linux with R-devel using _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_=true, so packages in Suggests (and Enhances) are not available, (other than recommended packages).\"\r\n\r\nMy interpretation of this would be that it is just that flag that is required.  However, if you suspect anything more complicated than expected is going on (as I know can be the case with these kinds of things), I'm happy to do a more thorough job of setting this up manually anyway - let me know what you think `[~jonkeane]`.\r\n"
