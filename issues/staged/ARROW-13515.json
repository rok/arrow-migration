I think this has come up a few times and the question is which transport to use (as we do not have gRPC in the browser) or whether one of the existing gRPC proxies/transcoders may suffice. If you're interested, an email to the mailing list may serve you better to gauge interest: dev@arrow.apache.org, see\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/community/>\u00a0"
