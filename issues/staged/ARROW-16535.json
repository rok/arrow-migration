Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTemporal rounding kernels (will) allow setting of rounding origin to a greater unit. This could be made more flexible by introducing a `greater_unit` parameter which would let user select the unit serving as origin. See [this discussion](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12657#issuecomment-1119580484) for more context.",
