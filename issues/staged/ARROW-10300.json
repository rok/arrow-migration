Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe TPC-H benchmark for datafusion works with Parquet/CSV data but the data generation routine described in the README generates `.tbl` data.\r\n\r\nCould we describe how the TPC-H Parquet/CSV data can be generated to make the benchmark easier to setup and more reproducible ?",

I imagine that others would more naturally use something like PyArrow or Pandas to perform the conversion, but I don't have experience with either of those currently (although I do intend to learn them)."
