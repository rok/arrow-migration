        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6744](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6744). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-5901 added checking for array equality with JSON arrays. This added the JsonEqual trait bound to the Array trait but it isn't exported making it private.\r\n\r\nThe JsonEqual is a public trait, but the equal module is private and the JsonEqual trait isn't exported like the ArrayEqual trait.\r\n\r\nAFAIK this makes it impossible to implement your own arrays that are bound by the Array trait.\r\n\r\nI suggest that JsonEqual is exported with pub use like the ArrayEqual trait from the array module.\u00a0",
