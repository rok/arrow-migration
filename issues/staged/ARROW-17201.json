        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17201](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17201). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a user has set the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, there is no way we can override that setting (especially to a null value) in a one-off call.\u00a0 Consider the following example.\u00a0 This fails:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nSys.setenv(AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=\"data\")\r\n\r\nnoaa <- s3_bucket(\"neon4cast-drivers/\",\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 endpoint_override = \"data.ecoforecast.org\",\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 anonymous = TRUE) \n```\r\nIf the env var is not set or unset, this succeeds.\u00a0 However, attempting to override the region does not help:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nnoaa <- s3_bucket(\"neon4cast-drivers/\",\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 endpoint_override = \"data.ecoforecast.org\",\r\n                  region = \"us-east-1\",\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 anonymous = TRUE) \n```\r\n(nor does it help to set the region to \"\", or NULL. \u2013 note this is a MINIO host and so region is not needed anyway).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nRelatedly, one might expect that AWS_S3_ENDPOINT could be used instead of setting `endpoint_override`, but this does not seem to work either (lemme know if you want that in a separate issue thread).\u00a0 At least on the plus side, the above code does not fail if AWS_S3_ENDPOINT is set to some other value than given in endpoint_override, so that is nice).\u00a0",
