Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCmake script should has consistent way to process all \\*_HOME env variables with location of 3rd party dependencies libraries (Snappy, Zlib, Zstd, Lz4 and others).\nIt seems, if \\*_HOME env variable is set for some library, but the library is not found by that path, cmake build script should error out.",
