        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14838](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14838). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is the same issue as ARROW-9851, but I dont believe the correct fix was implemented.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe merged fix lets you control if AVX512 is used by a compile flag, but that is sub-optimal because:\r\n\r\na) It forces you to avoid avx512 instructions solely in order to be able to run under valgrind\r\n\r\nb) You dont always have control of the compile flags, ie if you are pip installing pyarrow\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI actually reached out to the valgrind community and they insisted that pyarrow is at fault for not checking the CPU feature flags.\u00a0 Apparently valgrind will instrument the CPU feature flags when you run under valgrind, and it would should AVX512 is not supported, and so pyarrow should avoid using it ( I assume arrow would hit a similar issue if run on an actual CPU without AVX512 support ).\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease look into dynamically checking the CPU flags to avoid this issue and it has become a major issue for us, we cant valgrind our processes anymore now that we import arrow / pyarrow in many places.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nvalgrind error:\r\n\r\nThis is the error from valgrind:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```\n\r\nvex amd64->IR: unhandled instruction bytes: 0x62 0xF1 0xFD 0x8 0x6F 0x44 0x24 0xA 0xC7 0x43\r\nvex amd64->IR:\u00a0\u00a0 REX=0 REX.W=0 REX.R=0 REX.X=0 REX.B=0\r\nvex amd64->IR:\u00a0\u00a0 VEX=0 VEX.L=0 VEX.nVVVV=0x0 ESC=NONE\r\nvex amd64->IR:\u00a0\u00a0 PFX.66=0 PFX.F2=0 PFX.F3=0\r\n==32035== valgrind: Unrecognised instruction at address 0x1085ea85.\r\n==32035==\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 at 0x1085EA85: arrow::compute::internal::RegisterScalarAggregateSumAvx512(arrow::compute::FunctionRegistry*) (in /home/ra7293/user/hfalgo_csp/.venvs/PY36/build_tools_venv/lib/libarrow.so.100.1.0)\r\n==32035==\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 by 0x1067967C: arrow::compute::GetFunctionRegistry() (in /home/ra7293/user/hfalgo_csp/.venvs/PY36/build_tools_venv/lib/libarrow.so.100.1.0)\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nresponse from valgrind dev community:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```\n\r\n> 0x62 0xF1 0xFD 0x8 0x6F 0x44 0x24 0xA 0xC7 0x43\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis is\u00a0 vmovdqa64 0xa0(%rsp),%xmm0\u00a0 which requires CPU feature flag\r\nAVX512VL/AVX512F which is not supported by valgrind 3.18.1.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn the results of the emulated CPUID instruction, valgrind tells\r\nthe running application that AVX512 is not supported.\r\nIt is a bug in pyarrow ( python ) that its initialization routine\r\ndoes not check the cpu feature flags, and switch its later run-time\r\ninstructions appropriately.\u00a0 Please report this bug to the maintainers\r\nof pyarrow.\u00a0 Modern run-time libraries use the STT_GNU_IFUNC feature\r\nto choose at run time which instruction set is available and may be used.\r\npyarrow (and/or python3 itself) must upgrade.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGcc supports compile-time feature flags to avoid generating code\r\nthat uses certain instructions.\u00a0 Run \"info gcc\" and search for \"avx512\",\r\npaying attention to the flags beginning with \"-mavx512\", and in particular\r\nthe \"-mno-avx512\" variants.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSome software administration systems for installing and maintaining\r\nsoftware packages can limit the hardware features that packages\r\nmay assume.\u00a0 You may be able to work-around valgrind's non-support\r\nfor AVX512 by telling the packaging system to avoid the package\r\nvariants which require AVX512.\r\n```\r\n```\n\r\n*no* further _formatting_ is done here\n```\r\n\u00a0",

Valgrind does not support this.  Arrow does not check which flags Valgrind supports when compiling (presumably most users are not going to use Valgrind and would rather have the better performance).\r\n\r\nSo at the moment I think it's pretty acceptable to say \"If a developer is going to use Valgrind then the burden is on the developer to ensure they manually specify Arrow does not use AVX512\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is something we could add to our C++ development docs.  We could maybe raise a JIRA for a new CMake option \"valgrind compatibility\" which disables AVX512.  There is already a (perhaps hidden / not-documented) flag ARROW_TEST_MEMCHECK which disables a number of tests that are not \"valgrind friendly\" but I think that is an orthogonal issue."
