Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow that the Get API is refactored in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1807,>\u00a0we should do the same for the Create API.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\nHave a MutablePlasmaBuffer class, which is returned by Create\r\n```java\n\r\nStatus Create(int64_t data_size, int64_t metadata_size, std::shared_ptr<MutablePlasmaBuffer>* buffer)\r\n```\r\nThis allocates the data in shared memory, but does not associate it with the object id yet. This way we get get rid of the Abort() call.\r\n\r\nMove the Seal() method into the MutablePlasmaBuffer and let it return the object ID.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to what `[~pitrou]` suggested here:\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1807",
