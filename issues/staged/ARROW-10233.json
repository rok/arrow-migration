        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10233](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10233). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMake array_value_to_string available in all Arrow builds\r\n\r\nCurrently the array_value_to_string function it is only available if the `feature = \"prettyprint\"` is enabled. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for making this change is that I want to be able to use `array_value_to_string` to write tests (such as on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8346) but currently it is only available when `feature = \"prettyprint\"` is enabled.\r\n\r\nIt appears that [~nevi_me] made prettyprint compilation optional so that arrow could be compiled for wasm in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7400. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9088 explains that this is due to some dependency of pretty-table;   `array_value_to_string` has no needed dependencies.",
