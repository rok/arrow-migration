        "title": "[Python] Add filesystem capabilities to other IO formats (feather, csv, json, ..)",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9938](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9938). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the parquet IO functions, we support reading/writing files from non-local filesystems directly (in addition to passing a buffer) by:\r\n\r\n- passing a URI (eg `pq.read_parquet(\"s3://bucket/data.parquet\")`)\n- specifying the filesystem keyword (eg `pq.read_parquet(\"bucket/data.parquet\", filesystem=S3FileSystem(...))`) \n  \n  On the other hand, for other file formats such as feather, we only support local files or buffers. So for those, you need to do the more manual (I _suppose_ this works?):\n  \n  ```python\n  \n  from pyarrow import fs, feather\n  \n  s3 = fs.S3FileSystem()\n  \n  with s3.open_input_file(\"bucket/data.arrow\") as file:\n      table = feather.read_table(file)\n  ```\n  \n  So I think the question comes up: do we want to extend this filesystem support to other file formats (feather, csv, json) and make this more uniform across pyarrow, or do we prefer to keep the plain readers more low-level (and people can use the datasets API for more convenience)?\n  \n  cc `[~apitrou]` `[~kszucs]`\n",

Since it will be my first contribution, I might ask for guidance in the process. As a first question: Should I split this into multiple PRs per format (i.e. one PR for csv, feather, json, respectively) or combine them into one larger PR?"
