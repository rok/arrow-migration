Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a column is virtual on read and will remain virtual after writing then materializing and grouping on it is a pure waste. Maybe Partitioning::Partition should take a \"already known\" partition expression and only group on columns not in it?",
