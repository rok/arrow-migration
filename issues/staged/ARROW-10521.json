Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8579 adding/replacing/removing whole columns was implemented using the syntax `table[[column]] <- value`. Another common way to do this is `table[, column] <- value`, though there are more decisions that are under that rock (what to do about row manipulation (e.g. `table[row, ] <- value`), etc.).",
