It worked.\r\n\r\nI see you are running \"**sudo** python3 setup.py install\".\u00a0 Is \"ARROW_HOME\" preserved after sudo? Maybe it will cause trouble for cmake to find some components."

I used sudo because there were some packages being written to dist-packages; the environment was not passed to sudo and using **sudo -E python3 setup.py** install did the job.\r\n\r\nI've written a [gist](https://gist.github.com/heavyinfo/04e1326bb9bed9cecb19c2d603c8d521)\u00a0detailing all the setups needed to build and install arrow, pyarrow in ARM if anyone needed.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you."
