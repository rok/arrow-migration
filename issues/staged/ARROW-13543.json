Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowing ARROW-13344, we should handle the case in which the user calls `summarise()` but does not call any aggregate functions in it.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is unhandled and results in errors (which are then are converted to warnings) like:\r\n```java\n\r\nWarning: Error in x[c(\"fun\", \"options\")] : object of type 'environment' is not subsettable ; pulling data into R\n```\r\nor when the expression in `summarise()`\u00a0has only scalar literals:\r\n```java\n\r\nWarning: Error : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors\r\n; pulling data into R \n```\r\nor when there are zero arguments passed to `summarise()`\u00a0and there is no `group_by()` preceding it:\r\n```java\n\r\nWarning: Error : Invalid input type, expected 'character' actual 'NULL'\r\n; pulling data into R \n```\r\nWe should aim for consistency with `dplyr::summarise()`\u00a0in these cases, but if that's not practical then we should detect this case and throw a more informative error.",
