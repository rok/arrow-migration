        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5575](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5575). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm building a CMake project against arrow and I'm using:\r\n```java\n\r\nfind_package(arrow 0.13 CONFIG REQUIRED)\r\n```\r\nto get the arrow_shared target in scope. This works for me on macOS. I installed apache-arrow with:\r\n```java\n\r\nbrew install apache-arrow\n```\r\nHowever, when I attempt to build the project in a ubuntu xenial container, I get the following CMake error:\r\n```java\n\r\nCMake Error at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/arrow/arrowTargets.cmake:151 (message):\r\nThe imported target \"arrow_cuda_shared\" references the file\r\n\r\n\r\n\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libarrow_cuda.so.13.0.0\"\r\n\r\n\r\nbut this file does not exist. Possible reasons include:\r\n\r\n\r\n* The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.\r\n\r\n\r\n* An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n* The installation package was faulty and contained\r\n\r\n\r\n\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/arrow/arrowTargets.cmake\"\r\n\r\n\r\nbut not all the files it references.\r\n\r\n\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/arrow/arrowConfig.cmake:61 (include)\r\nCMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package)\r\n```\r\nI installed arrow with:\r\n```java\n\r\ncurl -sSL \"https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/arrow/KEYS\" | apt-key add -\r\necho \"deb [arch=amd64] https://dl.bintray.com/apache/arrow/ubuntu/ xenial main\" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list\r\napt-get update\r\napt-get install -y libarrow-dev=0.13.0-1\r\n```\r\nI can also install libarrow-cuda-dev, but I don't want to because I don't need it.",
