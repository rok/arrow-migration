        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14089](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14089). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a parquet file is written by parquet-mr before version 1.8.0, the bug [PARQUET-246](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-246) will produce data\u00a0inconsistent with the encoding of\u00a0DELTA_BYTE_ARRAY.\r\n\r\nThere are two solutions:\r\n\r\n1. We\u00a0should update the read side to recover data written with this bug.\r\n\r\n2. We need to throw\u00a0an exception if the parquet file is\u00a0written by parquet-mr before version 1.8.0 and has\u00a0DELTA_BYTE_ARRAY encoding data.",

We cannot produce file with this bug with hive after version 2.0.0\r\n\r\nBesides, in solution #1, I think maybe we should pass a\u00a0parameter(maybe the file version or a flag) down to\u00a0DeltaByteArrayDecoder. Code would be\u00a0modified in RowGroupReader,\u00a0ColumnReader and\u00a0DeltaByteArrayDecoder.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0"
