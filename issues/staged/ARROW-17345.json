        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17345](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17345). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/python.html#build-and-test> suggests setting PYARROW_WITH_$COMPONENT to 1 for every component used in C++. However, this does not make clear whether every single component has a corresponding flag, and also, due to mentioning the PYARROW_PARALLEL flag directly after, makes it unclear whether there are more environment variables that can affect build.\r\n\r\nThis could be fixed by including an explicit list of relevant variables and arguments for the PyArrow build.",
