Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now there's no way to get the R code that would create a schema from a schema. It would be nice to be able to do something like `dput(schema)` and return a string that is the R code that would reconstruct the schema. ",

Maybe rlang provides (or could provide) something we could define a method for? (If it doesn't, we could make an issue and ask.)"
