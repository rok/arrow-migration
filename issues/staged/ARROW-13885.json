Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm writing a recipe in the cookbook about creating schemas, and when I try to create one, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n`Error: NotImplemented: Extend`\r\n\r\nHere's the R code which I run to get this error:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nshare_data <- tibble::tibble(\r\n  company = c(\"AMZN\", \"GOOG\", \"BKNG\", \"TSLA\"),\r\n  price = c(3463.12, 2884.38, 2300.46, 732.39),\r\n  date = c(\"2021-09-03\",\"2021-09-03\", \"2021-09-03\", \"2021-09-03\")\r\n)\r\n\r\nshare_schema <- schema(\r\n  company = utf8(),\r\n  price = decimal(precision = 1, scale = 1),\r\n  date = utf8()\r\n)\r\n\r\nTable$create(share_data, schema = share_schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried to have a bit of a play around with parameters and a dig around to see what's going on, but I don't have much to go on.\r\n\r\nThe schema creation itself is working fine, it's when it's passed into Table$create which is where it's causing problems. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the error is at the C++ or R layer.  \r\n\r\nThis is the C++ function at the R layer which is where the error is coming from: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/1440d5ab95c423003ecbe06372663a85cfccf769/r/src/r_to_arrow.cpp#L1327-L1342",
