        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10865](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10865). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8839 added a DFSchema wrapper object into DataFusion so we can represent multiple relations (e.g. tables) easily\r\n\r\nHowever, it is somewhat annyoing to use now (as I discovered while trying to update IOx to use the latest version of Arrow).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, there are things like this:\r\n```\r\nArc::new(DFSchema::from(&parquet.schema())?),\r\n```\r\nInstead I would like to be able to write\r\n\r\n```\r\nparquet.schema().try_into()?\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several other conversions I would like to be able to use the standard Rust into  or `try_into` for:\r\n\r\nSchema -> DFSchema\r\nSchema -> Arc<DFSchema>\r\nArc<Schema> -> DFSchema\r\nArc<Schema> -> Arc<DFSchema>\r\n\r\nDFSchema -> Schema\r\nDFSchema -> Arc<Schema>\r\nArc<DFSchema> -> Schema\r\nArc<DFSchema> -> Arc<Schema>\r\n",
