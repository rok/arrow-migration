I found this when merging the macOS C++ builds and changed the build type to Xcode 8.3:\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/wesm/arrow/jobs/469297420#L2856\r\n\r\nI reported the issue into conda-forge at https://github.com/conda-forge/boost-cpp-feedstock/issues/40\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Ray project worked around this earlier this year: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/1688",
