Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are setting `Boost_DEBUG` in `ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake`. This makes our build logs more verbose than necessary. We should explicitly set it to FALSE and leave a comment so that people who are debugging Boost issues can re-enable it to see the logs",
