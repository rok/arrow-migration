The original issue report regarding the large size of `pyarrow.serialize(1)` has to do with the complexity of the record batch that is being internally serialized \u2013 the metadata itself is somewhat large. It's not caused by excess buffer padding. To make this smaller, we'd have to redesign the serialization format."
