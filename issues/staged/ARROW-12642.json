After installing arrow 4.0.0 via CRAN, I run\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ninstall_arrow(binary = FALSE, minimal = FALSE)\u00a0\r\n```\r\nAfter this completes, then\r\n```java\n\r\narrow_available()\r\n[1] TRUE\r\n\r\ncodec_is_available(\"lz4\")\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n```\r\nWhat can I do to help resolve this problem?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

You can instead set `LIBARROW_MINIMAL=false` before installing and that will give you the full build. Note that you don't need to install_arrow() after doing install.packages(\"arrow\"), install_arrow() is mainly a convenience for installing an nightly package or for reinstalling with different options (though sadly it appears not to be doing its job correctly there)."
