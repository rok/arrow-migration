Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, plasma evicts objects\u00a0according a global LRU queue. In Ray, this often causes memory-intensive workloads to fail unpredictably, since a client that\u00a0creates objects at a high rate can evict objects created by clients at lower rates. This is despite the fact that the true working set of both clients may be quite small.\r\n\r\ncc `[~pcmoritz]`",
