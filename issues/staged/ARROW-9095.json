        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9095](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9095). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I implemented the NullArray, I didn't comply with the spec under the premise that I'd handle reading and writing IPC in a spec-compliant way as that looked like the easier approach.\r\n\r\nAfter some integration testing, I realised that I wasn't doing it correctly, so it's better to comply with the spec by not allocating any buffers for the array.",
