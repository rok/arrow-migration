Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExample run here: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/actions/runs/1098292848\r\n\r\nThe job seems to be killed for some reason (\"exited with a non-zero exit code -9\").\r\nThe same test run works fine locally (using `archery docker run conda-cpp-valgrind`), so perhaps this is caused by some Github Actions restriction.",
