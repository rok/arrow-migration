        "title": "[Python] Update documentation about 'LZO' compression in parquet.write_table",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9636](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9636). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\r\n\r\nWhen trying to use 'LZO' codec in `pyarrow.parquet.write_table()` with below code, I get an error message indicating that 'LZO' is not available. However, this codec is mentioned as available in the doc [[https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.parquet.write_table.html]].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n\r\nfrom pyarrow import parquet as pq\r\n\r\npq.write_table(data, file, compression='LZO')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nError message\r\n```bash\n\r\n File \"pyarrow/_parquet.pyx\", line 1374, in pyarrow._parquet.ParquetWriter.write_table\r\n\r\nFile \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 99, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\n\r\nOSError: Codec type LZO not supported in Parquet format\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI would suggest correcting the documentation, or making this codec available?\r\n\r\nThanks for your support.\r\n\r\nBests,\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

So in any case, the error message is confusing, and we should, as you mention, also not include it in the documentation. \r\n\r\nContributions to update the docs are certainly welcome!"
