        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5673](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5673). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDescription is by `[~kou]`:\r\n\r\nI want to use GitLab Runner instead of CircleCI.\r\nBecause we can add custom GitLab Runners for us. For example, we can add GPU enabled GitLab Runner to test CUDA enabled Apache Arrow build. We can also increase timeout more than 5h for our GitLab Runners.\r\n\r\nWe can use https://gitlab.com/ to run GitLab Runners: https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/github/\r\nThis feature isn't included in the Free tier on GitLab.com (it's available with the Free tier for campaing for now (\\*1)) but GitLab.com provides Gold tier features to open source projects (\\*2). So we can use this feature by choosing \"CI/CD for external repo\" in \"New project page\" https://gitlab.com/projects/new .\r\n\r\n(\\*1)\r\n\r\n    So, for the next year we are making the GitLab CI/CD for GitHub feature a part of our GitLab.com Free tier.\r\n\r\n(\\*2)\r\n\r\n    As part of our commitment to open source, we offer all public projects our highest tier features (Gold) for free.\r\n",
