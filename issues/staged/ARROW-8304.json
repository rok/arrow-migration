Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have started a flight's local python server with TLS support using the testing certificates present in repo:\r\n```java\n\r\npython3 <arrow_dir>/python/examples/flight/server.py\u00a0\u00a0--host localhost --tls\u00a0<arrow_dir>/testing/data/flight/cert0.pem\u00a0<arrow_dir>/testing/data/flight/cert0.key\n```\r\nThis server is started successfully.\r\n\r\nNow I started testing the python client with TLS support.\r\n\r\n1. Client pushing a csv file to the flightendpoint server:\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\npython3 <arrow_dir>/python/examples/flight/client.py put --tls --tls-roots <arrow_dir>/testing/data/flight/root-ca.pem localhost:5005 /sharedFolder/dataset/iris.csv\n```\r\nFile\u00a0iris.csv is pushed successfully.\r\n\r\n2. List the flights available on the server\r\n```java\n\r\npython3 <arrow_dir>/python/examples/flight/client.py list --tls --tls-roots <arrow_dir>/testing/data/flight/root-ca.pem localhost:5005\n```\r\n\u00a0It is listing the flight which is pushed in above step 1.\r\n\r\n3. Get/Retrieve the specific flight(eg. /sharedFolder/dataset/iris.csv) from the server\r\n```java\n\r\npython3 <arrow_dir>/python/examples/flight/client.py get --tls --tls-roots <arrow_dir>/testing/data/flight/root-ca.pem -p /sharedFolder/dataset/iris.csv localhost:5005\n```\r\n\u00a0It is failing with following errors:\r\n> Ticket: <Ticket b\"(1, None, (b'/sharedFolder/dataset/iris.csv',))\">\n> \n> <Location b'grpc+tls://localhost:5005'>\n> \n> <font color=\"#ff0000\">E0401 06:43:30.164324553\u00a0 \u00a0 1055 ssl_transport_security.cc:1238] Handshake failed with fatal error SSL_ERROR_SSL: error:14090086:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed.</font>\n> \n> Traceback (most recent call last):\n> \n> File \"<arrow_dir>/python/examples/flight/client.py\", line 178, in <module>\n> \n> main()\n> \n> File \"<arrow_dir>/python/examples/flight/client.py\", line 174, in main\n> \n> commands[args.action](args, client)\n> \n> File \"<arrow_dir>/python/examples/flight/client.py\", line 98, in get_flight\n> \n> reader = get_client.do_get(endpoint.ticket)\n> \n> File \"pyarrow/_flight.pyx\", line 1144, in pyarrow._flight.FlightClient.do_get\n> \n> File \"pyarrow/_flight.pyx\", line 73, in pyarrow._flight.check_flight_status\n> \n> pyarrow._flight.FlightUnavailableError: gRPC returned unavailable error, with message: Connect Failed\r\nPython client.py is working for functions like\u00a0_list_flights(),\u00a0 do_action(),\u00a0push_data()_ but failing on\u00a0\r\n\r\n_get_flight()_ function for\u00a0code line.\r\n```java\n\r\nreader = get_client.do_get(endpoint.ticket) \n```",
