Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a StringFormatter for (presumably performant) formatting of primitive values, but PrettyPrint uses its own internal routines. We should probably base PrettyPrint on StringFormatter, making sure that all corner cases are correctly handled by the latter.",
