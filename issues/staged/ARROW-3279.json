Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn Windows, C++ modules are compiled once for each library kind (static, shared). This means we do twice the work on e.g. AppVeyor. We should be able to link the Arrow tests with the Arrow DLL instead, at least on Windows.\r\n\r\nThings are a bit more complicated for Parquet because of PARQUET-1420.",
