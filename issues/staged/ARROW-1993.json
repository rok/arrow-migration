        "title": "[Python] Add function for determining implied Arrow schema from pandas.DataFrame",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1993](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1993). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the only option is to use `Table/Array.from_pandas` which does significant unnecessary work and allocates memory. If only the schema is of interest, then we could do less work and not allocate memory.\r\n\r\nWe should provide the user a function `pyarrow.Schema.from_pandas` which takes a DataFrame as an input and returns the respective Arrow schema. The functionality for determing the schema is already available in the Python code, it is at moment just very tightly bound to the conversion infrastructure.",
