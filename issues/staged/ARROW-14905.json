Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis will allow more control over quoting. In `readr::write_csv()` `{}quote{`} instructs on how to handle fields which contain characters that need to be quoted: \r\n \\* `{}needed{`}: only quote fields which need them\r\n \\* `{}all{`}: quote all fields - I think this might be the implicit default behaviour for `write_csv_arrow()`\r\n \\* `{}none{`}: never quote fields",
