        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-951](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-951). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current generated API documentation doesn't respect the project's namespaces, it simply lists all exported objects. We should see if we can make typedoc display the project's structure (even if it means re-structuring the code a bit), or find another approach for doc generation.",

Using \"-~~mode modules\" and \"~~-tsconfig tsconfig/tsconfig.es2015.cjs.json\" actually generates some pretty reasonable output, but it doesn't show any of the modules that are _re-exported_ in `src/Arrow.ts`, it only shows them in their original locations (e.g. this would imply you should import Table with `import \\{ Table \\} from 'apache-arrow/table;` rather than `import \\{ Table \\} from 'apache-arrow';`. Both are valid, but we encourage the latter in our documentation and tutorials, so it would be nice if the API docs reflected that.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/iRath96/typedoc (outdated) and https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/pull/646 both claim to resolve this issue. We should test those out and see if we can help get them merged if they work for us."
