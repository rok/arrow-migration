        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16920](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16920). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDictionaryProvider leaks memory while adding dictionaries with duplicate encoding. Is this expected? Should the provider release the memory of the existing dictionary vector if it accepts another one with same encoding id ?\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\n```java\n\r\n\"dictionaryProvider\" should \" not leak memory while adding dictionaries with duplicate encoding\" in {\r\n\r\n  val allocator: RootAllocator = new RootAllocator()\r\n\r\n  val vector: ListVector = ListVector.empty(\"vector\", allocator)\r\n  val dictionaryVector1: ListVector = ListVector.empty(\"dict1\", allocator)\r\n  val dictionaryVector2: ListVector = ListVector.empty(\"dict2\", allocator)\r\n\r\n  val writer1: UnionListWriter = vector.getWriter\r\n  writer1.allocate\r\n  writer1.setValueCount(1)\r\n\r\n  val dictWriter1: UnionListWriter = dictionaryVector1.getWriter\r\n  dictWriter1.allocate\r\n  dictWriter1.setValueCount(1)\r\n\r\n  val dictWriter2: UnionListWriter = dictionaryVector2.getWriter\r\n  dictWriter2.allocate\r\n  dictWriter2.setValueCount(1)\r\n\r\n  val dictionary1: Dictionary = new Dictionary(dictionaryVector1, new DictionaryEncoding(1L, false, None.orNull))\r\n  val dictionary2: Dictionary = new Dictionary(dictionaryVector2, new DictionaryEncoding(1L, false, None.orNull))\r\n\r\n  val provider = new DictionaryProvider.MapDictionaryProvider\r\n  provider.put(dictionary1)\r\n  provider.put(dictionary2)\r\n\r\n  vector.clear()\r\n  provider.getDictionaryIds.asScala.map(id => provider.lookup(id).getVector.clear())\r\n\r\n  allocator.getAllocatedMemory shouldBe 0\r\n} \n```",

The provider should probably either close the old dictionary or throw an error if the dictionary is replaced instead of mutated."

Note that the CDataDictionaryProvider has some comments on this too. If the behavior is expected, then it needs to be reflected in the docstring/API contract: dictionaries in a provider should be mutated, not directly replaced. And then we should raise an explicit error for the situation described here."
