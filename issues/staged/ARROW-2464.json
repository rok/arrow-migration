Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen installing pyarrow 0.9.0 pipenv complains that futures has no matching versions.\r\n\r\nWhile that may be a bug in pipenv it does not matter. The standard way to specify a conditional dependency is using a marker.\r\n\r\nWe should use the python_version marker to tell pip if it should install futures or not.",
