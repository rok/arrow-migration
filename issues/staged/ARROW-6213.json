You could run the test standalone from the command line instead of going through `ctest`.\r\n\r\nYou could do the following: open `cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/compare_test.cc`; go to the `RandomCompareArrayScalar` function and log the values of variables `i` and `op` (for example using C or C++ printing).\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to do this, you can give me access to the machine but you'll have to explain me how to build.

The failures only happen in `RandomCompareArrayScalar`, only when `i >= 9` meaning the array length is >= 512 elements (regardless of the data type). I think the only likely explanation is a compiler bug.\r\n\r\nI would recommend trying a different compiler version and/or tweaking the compile options. What happens if you remove `-ftree-vectorize`?\r\n\r\nAlso cc `[~bkietz]`"
