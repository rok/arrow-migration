Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI recently had a requirement where I would have liked to construct a filename based on additional context from Apache Airflow (specifically execution_date).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to pass the additional kwargs to\u00a0**partition_filename_cb** so that the filename can be constructed using additional information rather than just the keys used for partitioning.\r\n\r\nI believe the fix should be as simple as passing kwargs to the\u00a0**partition_filename_cb**\u00a0inside **write_to_dataset.**",
