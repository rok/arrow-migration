Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the MATLAB - Feather interface supports reading numeric datatypes (double, single, uint\\* and int\\*) from a Feather file. We should also add support for writing these numeric datatypes to a Feather file.",

Instead, focus on converting to and from `arrow::RecordBatch` and `arrow::Table`. "
