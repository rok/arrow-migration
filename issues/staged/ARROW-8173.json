Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nChunkedArray has constraints on type uniformity of chunks which are currently only expressed in comments. At minimum debug checks should be added to ensure (for example) that an explicit type is shared by all chunks, at best the public constructor should be replaced with `Result<std::shared_ptr<ChunkedArray>> ChunkedArray::Make(...)`.",
