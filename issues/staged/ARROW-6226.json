Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDiff reimplements a lot of PrettyPrint which didn't quite fit the former's required use case and slightly changes the output format. Extract the shared code to a header `pretty_print_internal.h` which can be used by both and update the pretty print tests to reflect the new format.",
