Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOne ARROW-13059 is done and we have historical data for each build saved somewhere reliable + accessible, we can analyze it. (We can even use arrow to do that!)\r\n\r\nAt a minimum we should do the following:\r\n- days since last passing\n- last commit that passed\n- % of failures in the past week, month, year\n  \n  Some of this info has also been requested to be added to the emails as well, though that is a separate ticket at ARROW-12821. This ticket should be only for that information on the static site. We might use the same machinery/code for both, but they should be implemented separately so that they don't distract or block each other.",
