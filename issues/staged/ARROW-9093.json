Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere's no way to set generic gRPC options which are useful for tuning behavior (e.g. round-robin load balancing). Rather than bind all of these one by one, gRPC allows setting arguments as generic string-string or string-integer pairs; we could expose this (and leave the interpretation implementation-dependent).",
