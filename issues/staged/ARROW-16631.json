Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nYou can't do the equivalent of\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nSELECT x, y FROM table ORDER BY x * y ASC;\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause sorting requires a named column AND because sorting is only done in a SinkNode. You can project to {x, y, x\\*y} then sort on x\\*y, but you can't then project back to {x, y} on the sorted data because that's a new ExecPlan and order is not preserved. In R we have to handle this outside of an ExecPlan.",
