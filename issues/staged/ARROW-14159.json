Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowup to ARROW-8379, which set use_threads = FALSE on Windows. See discussion about adding more controls, disabling threading in some places and not others, etc. We want to do this soon after release so that we have a few months to see how things behave on CI before releasing again.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCollecting some CI hangs after ARROW-8379\r\n\r\n1.

I'm not sure how helpful this is but up to this point I have to reliably reproduce this issue."
