        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14168](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14168). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen someone calls median or quantile, we warn them that it is approximate. When a session is interactive, this happens only the first time in interactive sessions for `median` and `quantile` https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d197ad31c3d7c16ecee74cb76a71ce397e905b3b/r/R/dplyr-summarize.R#L107-L111\r\n\r\nBut when we test, the session is not interactive so we get a number of spurious extra warnings. Because of this we set a local testthat edition https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d197ad31c3d7c16ecee74cb76a71ce397e905b3b/r/tests/testthat/test-dplyr-summarize.R#L299-L301 which swallows any extra warnings.\r\n\r\nWe can either only warn once regardless of interactivity (which is probably totally fine for these warnings), or we could use something like `local_interactive` in these tests so that we only get the first warning https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_interactive.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
