Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn clang 6 / Ubuntu 14.04, this file takes about 3 minutes to compile with `-O3`. Probably you want to break up this file into smaller compilation units since the complexity in the amount of generated code is apparently overwhelming clang. TensorFlow's function registry is broken up into a large number of smaller compilation units: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/kernels",
