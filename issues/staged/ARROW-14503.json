        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14503). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe datasets API uses the RecordBatchFileReader to read feather files.  This reader will always \"read\" the entire file.  If the file is memory mapped this might not be a true read.  However, the datasets API never uses memory mapped files.\r\n\r\nThis large read from RAM (or worse, disk) becomes a bottleneck for simple queries that load only a few columns from the dataset.\r\n\r\nThe fix may be to modify the reader to seek out and pluck only the needed data.  Or the fix may be to modify the datasets API to use memory mapped files when possible (although the former approach seems more generally applicable).\r\n\r\nThis is related to ARROW-8250 but that issue seems more focused on row filtering while this issue is for column filtering.\r\n\r\n",
