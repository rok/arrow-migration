        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9425](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9425). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have been playing with pyo3 to ship and call this library directly from Python, and the current ExecutionContext can't be used within Python with threads due to the usage of `Box<dyn TableProvider>` on `datasources`, i.e. no `Sync` nor `Send`.\r\n\r\nThis issue likely affects integration of DataFusion with other libraries.\r\n\r\nI propose that we allow ExecutionContext to be sharable between threads, e.g. using `Box<dyn TableProvider + Send + Sync>`.\r\n",
