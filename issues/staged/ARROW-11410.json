        "title": "[Rust][Parquet] Implement returning dictionary arrays from parquet reader",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11410](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11410). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the Rust parquet reader returns a regular array (e.g. string array) even when the column is dictionary encoded in the parquet file.\r\n\r\nIf the parquet reader had the ability to return dictionary arrays for dictionary encoded columns this would bring many benefits such as:\r\n \\* faster reading of dictionary encoded columns from parquet (as no conversion/expansion into a regular array would be necessary)\r\n \\* more efficient memory use as the dictionary array would use less memory when loaded in memory\r\n \\* faster filtering operations as SIMD can be used to filter over the numeric keys of a dictionary string array instead of comparing string values in a string array\r\n\r\n`[~nevime]` \u00a0, `[~alamb]` \u00a0 let me know what you think",

This is the kind of thing that is on our longer term roadmap and I would love to help (e.g. code review, or testing , or documentation, etc).\r\n\r\nLet me know! "
