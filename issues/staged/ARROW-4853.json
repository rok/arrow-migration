Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n-ARROW-3954-\u00a0added the ability to slice arrays. It's been implemented on the Array trait, so callers might expect it to also work on ListArray and StructArray.\r\n\r\nIt looks like for ListArray, the offset buffer is sliced, but the child_data buffer is not modified. This leads to an assertion failure.",

In slicing, the `child_data` should not be modified. Instead, the offset should be applied to the `child_data` when it is returned. "
