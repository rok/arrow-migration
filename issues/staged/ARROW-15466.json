        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15466](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15466). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPlease tag v7 of arrow for Go with the method that Go expects for modules to specify their versions. At the current moment, if you want to upgrade to v7, you have to give a specific hash or a specific tag as part of the `go get` command instead of doing `go get github.com/apache/arrow/go/arrow/v7@latest`. This is because there is no `go/v7.0.0` tag pointing at the commit.\r\n\r\nThere is a `go/v6.0.1`. This request is to tag the versions in v7 with the same tag format alongside the `apache-arrow-7.0.0` tag.\r\n\r\nSee this page to see an example of the tag being recognized by Go modules properly: <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/arrow/go/v6.> If I replace that with `v7`, it does not currently recognize a stable version: <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/arrow/go/v7>.",
