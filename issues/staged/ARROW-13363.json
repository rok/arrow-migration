Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn R, `is.nan()` can be called on a vector of any type and will return `FALSE` at every position for non-floating point number vectors. For consistency, the `is.nan()` binding in the arrow R package should work this way too, but currently it throws an error if called on a non-floating point field.",
