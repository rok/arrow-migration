        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15074](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15074). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen reading an arrow file with buffers LZ4-compressed with multiple frames, we get\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nOSError: Lz4 compressed input contains more than one frame\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttached is an example of such a file, which can be opened with\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow.ipc\r\nwith pa.ipc.open_file(\"b.arrow\") as reader:\r\n    print(reader.get_batch(0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat fails with the error above.\r\n\r\nThe LZ4 frame supports multiple frames and we do not refer that only one frame should be on a buffer as part of the spec.",

At least the LZ4 C API allows streaming compression inside a single frame. Also, emitting multiple frames is probably worse for compression efficiency (because \"Each frame is considered independent\" as per the [LZ4 spec](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Frame_format.md#general-structure-of-lz4-frame-format))."
