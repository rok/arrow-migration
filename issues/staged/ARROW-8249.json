Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe now have two similar APIs with Table and LogicalPlanBuilder and although they are similar, there are some differences and it would be good to unify them. There is also code duplication and it most likely makes sense for the Table API to delegate to the query builder API to build logical plans.",
