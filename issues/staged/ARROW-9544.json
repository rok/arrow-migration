As it turns out, these Parquet writing options are not well tested in the R package. In this case, the actual function name is `parquet___WriterProperties___Builder__version`, so that's why it's not finding it.\r\n\r\nWould you be interested in submitting a pull request to fix this? The fix goes here https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/R/parquet.R#L260, and then you'd add a test in tests/testthat/test-parquet.R along the lines of your reprex."
