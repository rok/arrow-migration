Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the assumption is that both processes are running on localhost. While also interesting (to see how fast things can go taking network IO out of the equation) it is not very realistic. It would be good to both establish a baseline network IO benchmark between two hosts and then see how close a Flight stream can get to that",
