        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5883](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5883). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs described in\u00a0<http://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Layout.html#dictionary-encoding>, List type encoding should be supported.\r\n\r\nNow ListVector getObject returns a ArrayList implementation, and its equals and hashCode are already overwritten, so it could be directly supported to be hashMap key in DictionaryEncoder. Since we won't change Dictionary data during encoding/decoding process, use mutable key seems dose't matter.\r\n\r\nStructVector is similar to ListVector.",
