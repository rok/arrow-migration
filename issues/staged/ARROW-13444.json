        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13444](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13444). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are currently 5 header files which uses `std::result_of`. As specified here <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/result_of,> `std::result_of` got deprecated in c+17 and removed in c 20. Because of this, its not possible to include the c+ arrow headers in a project using c++20 without getting compilation errors.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, cppreference specifies how `std::invoke_result` can be used instead of `std::result_of`. Unfortunately\u00a0`std::invoke_result` was only added in c+17 and therefore I expect that solving this will require some macro work, to keep c+14 and lower support.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is\u00a0 the first time I post an issue and I hope I have followed the rules.",
