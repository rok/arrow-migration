Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI spent some time today trying to migrate my Ubuntu 14.04 machine over to use the latest conda-forge packages based on the Anaconda gcc7 toolchain\r\n\r\nIf you follow development.rst you will most likely have problems. I needed to install the `gcc_linux-64` and `gxx_linux-64` packages to get the gcc7 compilers. Arrow wouldn't build out of the box for me after this, with linker errors related to `pthread`. According to the conda-forge developers a workaround is here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/conda-forge/eccodes-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/build.sh#L11\r\n\r\nThere may be some other way around the issue",
