Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/10492\r\n\r\n- The chapter \"Writing to Partitioned Datasets\" still presents a \"solution\" with \"hdfs.connect\" but since it's mentioned as deprecated no more a good idea to mention it.\n- The chapter \"Reading a Parquet File from Azure Blob storage\" is based on the package \"azure.storage.blob\" ... but an old one and the actual \"azure-sdk-for-python\" doesn't have any-more methods like get_blob_to_stream(). Possible to update this part with new blob storage possibilities, and also another mentioning the same concept with Delta Lake (similar principle but since there are differences ...)\n  \n",
