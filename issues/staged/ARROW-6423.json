If you are fixing this, could you also fix the python documentation? It lists 'snappy' as a valid compression option:\r\n\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.CompressedOutputStream.html#pyarrow.CompressedOutputStream>\r\n\r\nThe doc also lists the `CompressesOutputStream` as having a `tell` method. When users try to use it, it fires `NotImplementedError` if I remember correctly. It might be worth removing the method from the documentation."
