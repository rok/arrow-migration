Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`dev/release/post-09-python.sh` uploads `.wheel`/`.tar.gz` for RC ( https://apache.jfrog.io/ui/native/arrow/python-rc/  ) not release ( https://apache.jfrog.io/ui/native/arrow/python/ ) . They are the same content (because we copy artifacts of passed RC to release) but we should upload `.wheel`/`.tar.gz` for release to clarify that we use vote passed artifacts.",
