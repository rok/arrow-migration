Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that some CMake options silently allow invalid values, such as `-DARROW_SIMD_LEVEL=foobar`. We should validate inputs to avoid typos (such as \"SSE42\" instead of \"SSE4_2\").",
