Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13952 introduced testing for the various computer kernel signatures.  Many kernels likely do not support union types (e.g. arithmetic or string kernels) but there are a number of kernels that should operate on any possible input type (e.g. drop_null, filter, take) and we should verify these kernels work correctly with union types.",
