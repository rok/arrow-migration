Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor vectors whose data elements reside in continuous memory segments,\u00a0they should implement a common super interface. This will avoid unnecessary code branches.\r\n\r\nFor now, such vectors include fixed-width vectors and variable-width vectors. In the future, there can be more vectors\u00a0included.",
