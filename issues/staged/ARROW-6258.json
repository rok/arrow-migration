        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6258](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6258). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCRAN builds binary packages for Windows and macOS. It generally does this by building on its servers and bundling all dependencies in the R package. This has been accomplished by having separate processes for building and hosting system dependencies, and then downloading and bundling those with scripts that get executed at install time (and then create the binary package as a side effect).\r\n\r\nARROW-3758 added the Windows PKGBUILD and related packaging scripts and ran them on our Appveyor. This ticket is to do the same for the macOS scripts.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these tickets is to bring the whole build pipeline under our version control and CI so that we can address any C++ build and dependency changes as they arise and not be surprised when it comes time to cut a release. A side benefit is that they also enable us to offer a nightly binary package repository with minimal additional effort.",
