        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12265](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12265). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow arrays can share the same backing store, even if the array is just a \"view\" of a slice of another array.\r\n\r\nYet, when `flight_data_from_arrow_batch` encodes the arrays into a FlightData, it blindly copies the entire buffer ready to be sent over the wire.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, when DataFusion uses the `arrow::compute::limit` operator to return a few elements of an array, we still end up with a the full (potentially) large array being sent over the wire.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince encoding the array in a FlightData involves copying the data anyway, perhaps it would be beneficial to take the Array length in consideration and copy only the parts of the buffer that contain actual data.",
