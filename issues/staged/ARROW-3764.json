Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAlong with defining appropriate abstractions for dealing with generic filesystems in C+, we should implement the machinery for reading multiple Parquet files in C+ so that it can reused in GLib, R, and Ruby. Otherwise these languages will have to reimplement things, and this would surely result in inconsistent features, bugs in some implementations but not others",
