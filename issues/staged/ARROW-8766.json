        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8766](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8766). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe new `pyarrow.fs` filesystems are now actual C++ objects, and no longer \"just\" a python interface. So they can't easily be expanded from the Python side, and the existing integration with `fsspec` filesystems is therefore also not working anymore. \r\n\r\nOne possible solution is  to have a C++ filesystem that calls back into a python object for each of its methods (possibly similar to how you can implement a flight server in Python, I suppose). \r\n\r\nSuch a FileSystem implementation would allow to make a `pyarrow.fs` wrapper for `fsspec` filesystems, and thus allow such filesystems to be used in pyarrow where new filesystems are expected.",
