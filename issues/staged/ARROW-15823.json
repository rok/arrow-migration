        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15823](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15823). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe RecordBatchReader interface is a key abstraction for the C stream API.  There is no great way today to convert a Table (or an iterable of batches) to a RecordBatchReader.\r\n\r\nDuckDb is currently doing this by wrapping the Table in an in-memory dataset and consuming it with a scanner but this has considerable overhead (especially if the Table has many batches).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could add bridge methods to export a table to a stream but I think this approach would be simpler.",
