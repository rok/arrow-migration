Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nC++ builds on AppVeyor have become slower and slower. Some of it may be due to the parquet-cpp repository merge, but I also suspect CPU resources on AppVeyor have become much tighter.\r\n\r\nWe should perhaps investigate Microsoft's Azure CI services as an alternative:\r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/pipelines/\r\n",
