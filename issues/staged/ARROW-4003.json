Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nToday we load the gandiva library always when trying to use the jni bridge, but we have run into issues causing the jvm to crash in untested paths.\r\n\r\nProposal is to do load the library in a separate process first and if it works only then load in the current process.\r\n\r\nThis would be done only once at startup/first load.",
