Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom a non-deterministic test failure in pandas reported to me by `[~jreback]`, I see that `PyArray_SimpleNew` calls `PyArray_DescrFromType`, which returns a reference to a cached dtype: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/1d592c12ca7f9c7f471aa8d20b538c5cb4f2cdce/numpy/core/src/multiarray/arraytypes.c.src#L4403. Since we expect to be able to mutate a datetime64 dtype in libarrow_python, this can cause failures in other code when uses a dtype that we have accidentally mutated internally.\n\nLuckily we are only modifying dtype metadata in a couple of places so this should not be too invasive to fix: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/python/pandas_convert.cc#L1995",
