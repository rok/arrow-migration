        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1554](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1554). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI just tried pyarrow on Windows 10, and it fails to import for me:\n\n```Java\n>>> import pyarrow\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\pyarrow\\__init__.py\", line 32, in <module>\n    from pyarrow.lib import cpu_count, set_cpu_count\nImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.\n```\n\nNot sure which DLL is failing, but I do see some DLLs in the pyarrow folder:\n\n```Java\nC:\\Users\\dima\\Documents>dir \"C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\pyarrow\\\"\n Volume in drive C has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 4CE9-CC3C\n\n Directory of C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\pyarrow\n\n09/19/2017  01:14 AM    <DIR>          .\n09/19/2017  01:14 AM    <DIR>          ..\n09/19/2017  01:14 AM         2,382,336 arrow.dll\n09/19/2017  01:14 AM           604,160 arrow_python.dll\n09/19/2017  01:14 AM             3,402 compat.py\n...\n```\n\nHowever, I cannot open them using ctypes.cdll. I wonder if some dependency is missing?\n\n```Java\n>>> open('C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python36\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\pyarrow\\\\parquet.dll', 'rb')\n<_io.BufferedReader name='C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python36\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\pyarrow\\\\parquet.dll'>\n>>>\n>>> cdll.LoadLibrary('C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python36\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\pyarrow\\\\parquet.dll')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\ctypes\\__init__.py\", line 426, in LoadLibrary\n    return self._dlltype(name)\n  File \"C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\ctypes\\__init__.py\", line 348, in __init__\n    self._handle = _dlopen(self._name, mode)\nOSError: [WinError 126] The specified module could not be found\n```\n",

That's going to be a much more reliable / robust environment all around for Windows users. It also installs dependencies like different MSVC runtimes.\n\nIf you or anyone knows a tool to figure out what DLL dependency is missing (based on what we've discussed, it suggests that it's missing symbols _outside_ pyarrow, like something in the MSVC runtime), that would be really helpful.

(Though that answer says 2015 - but points to the 2010 one. Also, appears to be x86 only. I installed this one: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)\n\n(Haven't actually tried conda yet - but I tried it before in a different environment, and I see \"Miniconda3/Library/bin/msvcp140.dll\" there - so makes sense that it works.)"
