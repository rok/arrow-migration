Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen a stream object fails to close in its destructor, CloseFromDestructor() will abort the process with a fatal error. This may not be desirable on e.g. networked filesystems where failing to closing isn't uncommon. Perhaps we should just log an error instead.\r\n\r\n(stream users should generally call Close() explicitly, but in some cases they may fail to do so, e.g. when an error interrupts processing)",
