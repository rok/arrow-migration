Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf we provide .deb and .rpm packages for C++ Arrow, users can install it easily. (At least, I'm happy as an user.)\n\nIs there any location to provide .deb and .rpm packages? If it doesn't exist, how about using https://packagecloud.io/ with \"Open Source plan\"? We can find \"Open Source plan\" by clicking \"Looking for free or open-source plans\" at https://packagecloud.io/pricing .\n",
