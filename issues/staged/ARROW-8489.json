Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-7801 added the \"autotune\" comment bot to fix linting errors and rebuild some generated files. cmake-format was left off because of Python problems (see description on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6932). And there's probably other things we want to add (autopep8 for python, and similar for other languages?)",
