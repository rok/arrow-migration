Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMakeIteratorGenerator is a stop-gap measure while we convert readers to be asynchronous.\u00a0 It is not generally safe in async pipelines code (could use to nested deadlock) and should be removed once we stop using it as a stop-gap as it may encourage someone to use it in the future.\u00a0 This JIRA is a reminder to clean it up.",
