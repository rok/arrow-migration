Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/JDASoftwareGroup/kartothek is a heavy user of Apache Arrow and thus a good indicator whether we have introduced some breakages in `pyarrow`. Thus we should run regular integration tests against it as we do with other libraries.",
