Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee eg https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/2473244858\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the build is installing the latest numpy 1.20.2, which doesn't work with pandas 0.14. So for an older version of pandas, we also need to install an older version of numpy.",
