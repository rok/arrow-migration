Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9108#issuecomment-755791235\r\n\r\nWe would like to pick a single SQL dialect in DataFusion to avoid what happened with Spark SQL where functions, https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html, were added seemingly ad-hoc making their usage very difficult and no clear feature matrix available.\r\n\r\nUsing an existing dialect will also allow us to re-use the documentation (and other tools) from that dialect. \r\n\r\n",
