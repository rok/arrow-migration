Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt should be possible to build a logical plan using colum names rather than indices since it is more intuitive. There should be an optimizer rule that resolves the columns and replaces these unresolved columns with column indices.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
