Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems (https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2842/running-pyarrow-on-pypy-segfaults#comment-50670536) that we are close to being able to run with PyPy. At the moment, we don't actively work on supporting PyPy but this would be a good start on providing feedback at what is still missing.\r\n\r\nTo have such an image, one would need to fork one of the current test setups in `docker-compose.yml` that build with system libraries (e.g. ubuntu-xenial or debian-testing) and exchange the system Python with the PyPy nightly builds from http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/",

To get started, is there any relevant documentation about the CI system or about how to locally kick off these containers and run the tests?"

We would need to additional flags to the CMake command to redirect it to using PyPy nightlies instead of the system Python. Additionally, we also need to download the PyPy nightly first in the Dockerfile.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote that these files stem from the PR <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3688>\u00a0and may not yet work on master."
