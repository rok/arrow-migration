        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13335](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13335). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have some data in a pyarrow table and am running an algorithm on it which can not be (efficiently) expressed as a combination of pyarrow compute function calls. I used cython to implement the algorithm, but it seems that not the entire C++ API is exposed in cython, e.g. in python/pyarrow/includes/libarrow.pxd:1049 all ArrayBuilders lack the UnsafeAppend method. The documentation states `The Cython API more or less mirrors the C++ API` which I guess could mean that some methods are not available, but using UnsafeAppend seems like a good reason to use cython.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I just inlcuded headers wrong/I shouldn't bind against these cython headers but directly against the c++ or something? I attached a code example with a setup.py in case I did that incorrectly. ",
