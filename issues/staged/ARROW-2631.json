A Flutter app can read the memory instead of doing JSON serialization and am assuming that this would make the app very performant.\r\n\r\nSo how does one go about creating such a lib - should I look at the JS folder and navigate around? Any tips or pointers to get started (without getting intimidated!) would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!"

In any case, it was closed ~1.5 years ago for lack of interest. If you're interested in working on a Dart implementation of Arrow, feel free to open a new issue and/or talk about it on the [development mailing-list](https://arrow.apache.org/community/)."
