Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have a system running Linux on an old AMD Athlon\u2122 II X2 250 Processor (in case it matters). In a test environment I installed Python 3.10.1, pyarrow 6.0.1 and numpy 1.22.0.\r\n\r\n**The problem**\r\n\r\nCalling just a simple\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow\n```\r\nResults on a dead python interpreter (exit code 132) with the output\r\n```\n\r\n[1] \u00a0 \u00a028245 illegal hardware instruction (core dumped) \u00a0python\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have attached the backtrace gdb provides based on the core dump.",
