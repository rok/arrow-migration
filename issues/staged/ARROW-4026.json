        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4026). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBecause some tests depend on libraries from another component (e.g. \"gandiva\" relies on \"arrow\"), if we build \"gandiva\" and `ARROW_BUILD_TESTS=ON` then we must also built the tests attached to the \"arrow\" target. This can be hacked around using the `ARROW_TEST_INCLUDE_LABELS` option, but the best thing would probably be to create separate modular targets for the unit tests:\r\n\r\n- \"arrow-tests\" depends on \"arrow\"\n- \"parquet-tests\" depends on \"parquet\", \"arrow\"\n- \"gandiva-test\" depends on \"gandiva\", \"arrow\"",
