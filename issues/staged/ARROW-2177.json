        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2177](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2177). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAllowing both negative and positive scale makes it ambiguous what the scale of a number should be when it using exponential notation, e.g., `0.01E3`. Should that have a precision of 4 and a scale of 2 since it's specified as 2 points to the right of the decimal and it evaluates to 10? Or a precision of 1 and a scale of -1?\r\n\r\nCurrent it's the latter, but I think it should be the former.",
