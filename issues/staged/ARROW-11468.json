        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11468](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11468). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe\u00a0`read_json_arrow()`\u00a0function lacks a\u00a0`schema` argument, and it is not possible to specify a schema through `JsonParseOptions`. PyArrow allows the user to pass a schema to\u00a0`read_json()`\u00a0through `ParseOptions`\u00a0to\u00a0bypass automatic type inference. Implement this in the R package.",

It looks like JsonParseOptions is the name in R for PraseOptions that will be passed to the json parsing generally, yeah?"

It should be relatively straightforward to pass through `schema`\u00a0similarly to how\u00a0`newlines_in_values`\u00a0is passed through."
