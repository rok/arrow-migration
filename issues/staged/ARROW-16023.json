Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now, in Python, to signal an error to the client, you raise an exception. But some exceptions are unintentional, and for development/monitoring purposes, it would be good to log them. There's no way to differentiate between the two.\r\n\r\nARROW-15909 tries to log some exceptions and filter out ones that would just be noise, but a better long-term solution would be to mimic gRPC/Java and provide an error callback to explicitly signal that we want to raise an error.",
