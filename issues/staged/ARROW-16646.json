Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis only happens when the node has a bloom filter pushed down into it.  In that case it will attempt to hash the key columns in `arrow::compute::HashJoinBasicImpl::ApplyBloomFiltersToBatch` by calling `Hashing32::HashBatch` on a batch made up only of key columns.\r\n\r\nIf one of those key columns happens to be a scalar, and not an array, then this method triggers a `DCHECK` and crashes.",
