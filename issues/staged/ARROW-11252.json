Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would like to see DataFusion added to h2oai/db-benchmark so that we can see how we compare to other solutions (including Pandas, Spark, cuDF, and Polars).\r\n\r\nSince Polars (another Rust DataFrame library that uses Arrow) has already been added, I am hoping that we can learn from their scripts.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue filed against db-benchmark for adding DataFusion:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/h2oai/db-benchmark/issues/107",
