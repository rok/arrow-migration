        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4027](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4027). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have a parquet dataset (which originally came from Hive) stored locally in the directory `data/`. It has 4 files in it\r\n\r\n```\r\n data/foo1\r\n data/foo2\r\n data/foo3\r\n data/foo4\r\n ```\r\n\r\nUsing pyarrow I can read them via\r\n\r\n`pq.read_table(\"data/foo1\").to_pandas()`\r\n\r\nI am trying to read them into R using `read_table(\"data/foo1\")`, but I receive this error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n Error in ipc___RecordBatchFileReader__Open(file) : \r\n Invalid: Not an Arrow file \r\n ```\r\n\r\nFrom debugging, I've traced it to this line <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d54a154263e1dba5515ebe1a8423a676a01e3951/r/R/RecordBatchReader.R#L112>, which then goes to this Rcpp code <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d54a154263e1dba5515ebe1a8423a676a01e3951/r/src/recordbatchreader.cpp#L85>. It seems that this c++ function is expecting a single \"[file like object](<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/classarrow_1_1ipc_1_1_record_batch_file_reader.html#a7e6c66ca32d75bc8d4ee905982d9819e>)\"; I think because my data is split, there is a footer that is supposed to contain a file layout and schema which cannot be found, hence the error Not an Arrow file.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf I pass the whole directory using `read_table(\"data/\")` I will get\r\n\r\n```\r\n Error in ipc___RecordBatchFileReader__Open(file) : \r\n IOError: Error reading bytes from file: Is a directory \r\n ```\r\n\r\nSo, how can I use the R package to correctly read multiple parquet files? If I need to call RecordBatchFileReader with a pointer to the footer, file layout and schema, how do I find the footer of the dataset?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI cannot post the original dataset online, and I don't know what aspect of my data causes the code to break, so I don't quite know how to post a reproducible example. Tips on how to generate a partitioned dataset would be great",
