        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13511](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13511). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ninstall.packages() just emits a warning if a package doesn't install, so if that happens, the docker build step will succeed and then the docker run step will fail because the package can't install. This makes debugging CI failures harder, leading folks who don't know about this quirk down the wrong path.",
