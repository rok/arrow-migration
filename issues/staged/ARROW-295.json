Kinoshita (kinow):*\nLogged in exactly to create an issue for the DOAP file. I am doing more Python now, while still involved with Commons/Jena/OpenNLP and other Java projects. So every now and then I search for projects in ASF with Python, like Thrift, SIS, and I thought I would find Arrow using that [site that lists ASF projects by language](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?language).\r\n\r\nBut as Arrow does not have a DOAP file in\u00a0 <https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/projects.apache.org/trunk/data/projects.xml> I couldn't find it there. So just sent a pull request with a tentative doap file.\r\n\r\nCheers"
