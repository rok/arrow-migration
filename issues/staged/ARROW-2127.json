Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt should be possible to transfer an object that was created on the CPU to the GPU and vice versa. One natural implementation is to introduce a flag to plasma::Get that specifies where the object should end up and then transfer the object under the hood and return the appropriate buffer.",

If the source is CPU and target is GPU (or vice versa), then it would transfer across devices"
