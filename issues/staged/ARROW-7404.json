        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7404](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7404). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent code checks if a UTF-8 eight-bit code unit is within 0x00~0x7F\r\nby \"if (c >= 0)\", where c is defined as \"char\". This checking assumes\r\nchar is always signed, which is not true[1]. On Arm64, char is unsigned\r\nby default and causes some Gandiva unit tests fail.\r\n\r\nFix it by casting to \"signed char\" explicitly.\r\n\r\n[1] Cited from https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types\r\nThe signedness of char depends on the compiler and the target platform:\r\nthe defaults for ARM and PowerPC are typically unsigned, the defaults\r\nfor x86 and x64 are typically signed.",
