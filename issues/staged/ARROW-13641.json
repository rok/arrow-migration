Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the arrow::Table class has a method called GetColumnByName to get the underlying data for a column. I'd like to request a method called GetFieldByName(const std::string& name) that returns the corresponding Field of a given string name, if it exists.",
