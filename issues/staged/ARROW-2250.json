Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, if you send an INT and TERM signal to a parent plasma store process (Python one) it terminates it without cleaning the child process. This makes it hard to run plasma store in non-interactive mode. Inside shell ctrl-c kills both processes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, INT prints out an ugly KeyboardInterrup exception. Probably something nicer should be done.",

In this way then all future signal are handled by the process through that executable.\r\n\r\nThis makes everything cleaner and means that it is not needed to do any signal passing or cleanup."
