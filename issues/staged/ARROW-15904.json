        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15904](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15904). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOriginal description in ARROW-11090: \r\n\"This should also cover the ability to do with and without rollback (so have the ability to do e.g. 2021-03-30 minus 1 month and either get a null back, or 2021-02-28), plus the ability to specify whether to rollback to the first or last, and whether to preserve or rest the time.)\"\r\n\r\nFor example, in R, lubridate has the following functionality:\r\n\r\n- `rollbackward()` or `rollback()` which changes a date to the last day of the previous month or to the first day of the current month\n- `rollforward()` which rolls to the last day of the current month or to the first day of the next month.\n- all of the above also offer the option to preserve hms (hours, minutes and seconds) when rolling. \n  \n  This functionality underpins functions such as `%m-%` and `%m+%` which are used to add or subtract months to a date without exceeding the last day of the new month.\n  \n  {code:r}\n  library(lubridate)\n  \n  jan <- ymd_hms(\"2010-01-31 03:04:05\")\n  jan + months(1:3) # Feb 31 and April 31 returned as NA\n#> [1] NA                        \"2010-03-31 03:04:05 UTC\"\r\n#> [3] NA\r\n1.
