Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn docker containers it's common for `/etc/localtime` to not exist, and if it doesn't exist it causes a file not found error which is not handled in PyArrow. Workaround is to install `tzdata` into the container (at least for Ubuntu), but wanted to report upstream.",
