Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf you want to build the Parquet support for pyarrow, currently failure will pass silently. It would be better to opt-in to the extension build and get a hard failure if there is something misconfigured about your environment. ",
