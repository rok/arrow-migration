Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be useful to have compile-time macros in the headers specifying the major/minor/patch versions, so that users can more easily maintain code that can be built with a range of arrow versions.\r\n\r\nOther nice-to-haves:\r\n- Maybe a \"combiner\" func that basically spits out the value as an easy to compare integer e.g. 12000 for 0.12.0 or something.\n- Git hash",
