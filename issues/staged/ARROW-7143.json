Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDocker-compose has its limitations, one annoying one is that it writes the mounted directory with root user. Sadly there are builds which are contaminating the source directory, so we should have a wrapper script to handle the permissions properly.",
