Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\r\n\r\n[~wesm_impala_7e40], I am looking into switching Gandiva Redhat developer toolchain. We are not too familiar with it and not sure the effort required there.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile for the short term, can we turn get Crossbow builds to only do static linking for Dremio builds (through a travis env variable)? and Arrow can ship Gandiva linked to std-c++ dynamically?\r\n\r\nWe can then move to redhat toolchain for 0.13 version of Arrow?\r\n\r\nThx.",
