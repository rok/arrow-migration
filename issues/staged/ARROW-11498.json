Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen trying to install pyarrow 3.0.0 for Python 3.6 on Linux, it defaults to pulling down the source tarball and attempting to compile it rather than use either of the manylinux wheels. I've tested this using Python 3.6.2 and 3.6.12 on Fedora 33 x64 machine (however our CI exhibits the same issue)\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```bash\n\r\n\r\n$ pyenv version\r\n3.6.12 (set by /home/mandeep/.pyenv/version)\r\n$ python --version\r\nPython 3.6.12\r\n\r\n$ pip3 install pyarrow\r\nCollecting pyarrow\r\n Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/62/d3/a482d8a4039bf931ed6388308f0cc0541d0cab46f0bbff7c897a74f1c576/pyarrow-3.0.0.tar.gz\r\n Installing build dependencies ... done\r\nCollecting numpy>=1.16.6 (from pyarrow)\r\n Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/45/b2/6c7545bb7a38754d63048c7696804a0d947328125d81bf12beaa692c3ae3/numpy-1.19.5-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl\r\nInstalling collected packages: numpy, pyarrow\r\n Running setup.py install for pyarrow ... error\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI've added a link to our CI that exhibits the same problem and indicates that it only occurs on Python 3.6 on Linux (other Python versions and OSs are fine) - <https://github.com/datapane/datapane/runs/1828066893?check_suite_focus=true#step:10:117> .\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Closing this issue in the meantime."
