        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6781](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6781). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have multiple macros like `DCHECK_EQ` and `DCHECK_LT` which check various comparisons but don't report anything about their operands. Furthermore, the \"stream to assertion\" pattern for appending extra info has proven fragile. I propose a new unified macro which can capture operands of comparisons and report them:\r\n\r\n```cpp\n\r\n  int three = 3;\r\n  int five = 5;\r\n  DCHECK(three == five, \"extra: \", 1, 2, five);\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults in check failure messages like:\r\n```Java\n\r\nF1003 11:12:46.174767  4166 logging_test.cc:141]  Check failed: three == five\r\n  LHS: 3\r\n  RHS: 5\r\nextra: 125\r\n```\r\n",
