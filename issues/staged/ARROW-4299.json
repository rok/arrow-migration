        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4299](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4299). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRed Arrow CUDA, Red Plasma, Red Gandiva and Red Parquet depend on Red Arrow. But they don't specify Red Arrow version.\r\n\r\nThey don't work well without the same Red Arrow version. So they should depend on the same version as Red Arrow.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe will be able to implement with the following change:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n```ruby\n\r\nspec.add_runtime_dependency(\"red-arrow\", \"= #{spec.version}\")\r\n```",
