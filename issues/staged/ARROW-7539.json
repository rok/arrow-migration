        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7539](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7539). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer discussion <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6133#discussion_r364906302>.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we have reader/writer settings in `getFieldBuffers`\u00a0is wrong. To clarify, `getFieldBuffers`\u00a0is distinct from `getBuffers`. The former should be for getting access to underlying data for higher-performance algorithms. The latter is for sending the data over the wire. Seems we've mixed up use of both.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently in `VectorUnloader`, we used `getFieldBuffers`\u00a0to create `ArrowRecordBatch`\u00a0that\u2019s why we keep writer/reader indices in `getFieldBuffers`, we should use `getBuffers`\u00a0instead.",
