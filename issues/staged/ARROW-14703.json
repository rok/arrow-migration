Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's impossible to know what we do or do not support without literally trying it out.\u00a0 Other things to consider:\r\n\r\n\\*\u00a0\"I think it would be hella useful to have some kind of document giving a view into the arrow package\u2019s coverage of all things dplyr. This would be great for users and also as a project management kind of tool\"\r\n\r\n- \"and you could print that in an rd page...look into what dbplyr does: it has rd files for its dplyr methods https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html...it will be trickier for us because we don't export them, so you'll have to do more @roclet fun and probably pkgdown.yml work to make them show up\"\n  \n  Perhaps this could work as a longer form vignette and a shorter form rd file which prints out all the .rd functions?\n  \u00a0",
