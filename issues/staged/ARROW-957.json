Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently these documents are not rendered on the website. I would move them to the `apidoc/` folder and link to them in the main doxygen page. Probably this is the point where we also would move `apidoc/` back to `docs/`.",
