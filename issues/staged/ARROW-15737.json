Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have a parquet file with two columns (int64 and double) and 9 million rows. The parquet tools (parquet, parquet-reader, parquet-schema...) read it perfectly. (I have many files, actually, but they all exhibit the same behavior).\r\n\r\nThe following code fails with \"zsh bus error \u00a0ipython\":\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\npq.read_table(\"parquet_file\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThese snippets work properly.\r\n\r\npq.read_table(\"parquet_file\", use_lagacy_dataset=True)\r\n\r\nf = pq.ParquetFile(\"parquet_file\")\r\nf.read()\r\nfor batch in f.iterbatches():\r\n   print(len(batch))",
