I am not sure we need the `arrow/go/arrow` directory structure if simply `arrow/go` would suffice",

I still don't mind moving it back, but I am interested in the results.\r\n\r\nFor some background, the current reason for using the `.../go/arrow` path is so the Go package name of files in the `arrow` directory match. If we move the files back to `arrow/go`, the directory of the files will be `go` and the package name `arrow`, which is not the norm.\r\n"

It may make sense, then, to promote some files out of the `arrow` directory (like the README) in the event that you decide to leave it like that. It seemed odd to me to have the `go` directory not have at least a README (that's the only thing that Vitess has in its go directory https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/go)"
