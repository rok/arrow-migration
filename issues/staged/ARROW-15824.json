        "title": "[Python] Make pyarrow.parquet a package",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15824](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15824). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should probably make `pyarrow.parquet` a package and move `pyarrow.parquet_encryption` to `pyarrow.parquet.encryption`. Since that would slightly break the encryption API, it would probably be better to do this before 8.0.0 is released.\r\n",
