Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile working on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12267 , adding support for writing Timestamp types, I noticed we were also lacking support for other time types. Specifically, if you try to write an array with any of the following types as JSON it will panic:\r\n\r\nAn example of adding support for timestamps is on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9968\r\n\r\n```\r\npub type Date32Array = PrimitiveArray<Date32Type>;\r\npub type Date64Array = PrimitiveArray<Date64Type>;\r\npub type Time32SecondArray = PrimitiveArray<Time32SecondType>;\r\npub type Time32MillisecondArray = PrimitiveArray<Time32MillisecondType>;\r\npub type Time64MicrosecondArray = PrimitiveArray<Time64MicrosecondType>;\r\npub type Time64NanosecondArray = PrimitiveArray<Time64NanosecondType>;\r\npub type IntervalYearMonthArray = PrimitiveArray<IntervalYearMonthType>;\r\npub type IntervalDayTimeArray = PrimitiveArray<IntervalDayTimeType>;\r\npub type DurationSecondArray = PrimitiveArray<DurationSecondType>;\r\npub type DurationMillisecondArray = PrimitiveArray<DurationMillisecondType>;\r\npub type DurationMicrosecondArray = PrimitiveArray<DurationMicrosecondType>;\r\npub type DurationNanosecondArray = PrimitiveArray<DurationNanosecondType>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
