Has there been any discussion or roadmaps established for improving it?\r\n\r\nMost convincing Observables:\r\n \\* <https://observablehq.com/@duaneatat/apache-arrow-filtering-vs-array-filter>\r\n \\* <https://observablehq.com/@robertleeplummerjr/array-filtering-apache-arrow-vs-gpu-js-textures-vs-array-fil>",

I would guess that there is a lot of room for improvement, I don't know how much the filtering has been optimized to get V8 to produce good JIT'd code"

We have a heavily closure-packed\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nconst count = policiesTable.filter(\r\n    arrow.predicate.and(\r\n      arrow.predicate.col('proto').eq(6),\r\n      arrow.predicate.or(\r\n        arrow.predicate.and(\r\n          arrow.predicate.col('startPort').gt(0),\r\n          arrow.predicate.col('endPort').lt(200)\r\n        ),\r\n        arrow.predicate.col('startPort').eq(49152)\r\n      ),\r\n      arrow.predicate.col('isActive').eq(true)\r\n    )\r\n  ).count();\r\n```\r\n\r\nbeing compared with a single-closure filter:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  const predicate = policy => {\r\n    return policy.proto === 6\r\n      && ((policy.startPort > 0 && policy.endPort < 200) || policy.startPort === 49152)\r\n      && policy.isActive === true;\r\n  };\r\n  \r\n  const count = _(policies).filter(predicate).value().length;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt hardly seems like an apples-to-apples comparison. Is it possible to translate the filter described above into some JavaScript code as a string and compile that? "

Happy to help get a PR through once we arrive on a good solution here. I'm wondering if we may be able to approach it like Bostock does in <https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/manipulating-flat-arrays>\u00a0(which seems to be of <https://observablehq.com/@duaneatat/apache-arrow-filtering-vs-array-filter#flatFilterStats>\u00a0and is columnar)"

That would have included this case:\r\n \\* deforested typed native code via wasm\r\n \\* multicore & simd via workers & wasm\r\n \\* GPU interp via RAPIDS\r\n\r\nIMO we need the follow-up tutorial on real-world IO and follow-up on real compute (not the weird predicate stuff). My limited cycles need to be on that or figuring out GPU IO bindings.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo be clear, you can manually do the ^^^ on this use case. It'd take real experimentation, e.g., not even clear here if row-based, columnar, or a tiled hybrid is the right choice. And probably not the filter predicates - we definitely avoid them in prod ;)"

It could certainly be more optimized if it JIT'd into a flat JS function.\r\n\r\nAn apples-to-apples comparison would be to filter the rows individually:\r\n\r\n```javascript\n\r\nfunction filterStruct(struct, predicate) {\r\n  let keys = [], i = -1, j = -1;\r\n  for (let row of table) if (predicate(row, ++i)) keys[++j] = i;\r\n  return DictionaryVector.from(struct, new Int32(), keys)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction predicate(policy) {\r\n  return policy.proto === 6\r\n      && ((policy.startPort > 0 && policy.endPort < 200) || policy.startPort === 49152)\r\n      && policy.isActive === true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst count = filterStruct(policiesTable, pred).length\r\n```\r\n\r\nI generally agree with `[~lmeyerov]` though, don't do inline scans and reductions if you care about performance. Use WASM/web workers to distrubute across CPU cores, or (better yet) WebGL TransformFeedback on the GPU (both work in node and browsers, neither require non-JS dependencies). \r\n Arrow excels at both of these strategies."

Clearly I overfit for that use-case at the expense of everything else. I'd be open to any proposals to improve filter performance, but it would be ideal if whatever we do could maintain the dictionary-encoded optimization.\r\n\r\nAnother approach to take in this benchmark would be to use the mbostock flat array approach but with arrow vectors rather than JS arrays. I don't think that would do any better than Paul's suggestion in the previous comment though and it is harder to grok. It would be interesting to benchmark both.\r\n\r\n> I generally agree with Leo Meyerovich though, don't do inline scans and reductions if you care about performance.
