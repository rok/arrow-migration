Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ncmake_modules/DefineOptions.cmake\r\n \u00a0 define_option(ARROW_CUDA \"Build the Arrow CUDA extensions (requires CUDA toolkit)\" ON)\r\n \u00a0 define_option(ARROW_PLASMA \"Build the plasma object store along with Arrow\" ON)\r\n\r\nThe corrent sequence is as follow:\r\n (1) plasma_client.Create(object_id, size, nullptr, 0, &buff, 1);\u00a0 // where device_num > 0\r\n (2) plasma_client.Seal(object_id);\r\n (3) buff = nullptr;\r\n (4) plasma_client.Release(object_id);\r\n (5) plasma_client.Delete(object_id);\r\n\r\nTo set buff nullptr (step 3) just before release the object (step 4) because CloseIpcBuffer is in its destructor (class CudaBuffer).\r\nIf a user does not do that promptly, CloseIpcBuffer will be blocked.\r\nThen, the following error may occure when another object created.\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IOError: Cuda Driver API call in /home/zilliz/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/gpu/cuda_context.cc at line 156 failed with code 208: cuIpcOpenMemHandle(&data, \\*handle, CU_IPC_MEM_LAZY_ENABLE_PEER_ACCESS) (nil)\r\n",
