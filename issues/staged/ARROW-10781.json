        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10781](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10781). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to start building a cost-based optimizer, we need some statistics about data sources. The most basic statistic would be number of rows.\r\n\r\nI propose that we add a Statistics struct that initially just makes a total row count available but that we can later extend to support more advanced statistics.\r\n```java\n\r\nstruct Statistics {\r\n  row_count: Option<usize>\r\n} \n```\r\nWe can then add a method to TableProvider:\r\n```java\n\r\ntrait TableProvider {\r\n  fn statistics() -> Option<Statistics>;\r\n} \n```\r\nStatistics should be optional because not all data sources can provide statistics.",
