Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSet `VectorSchemaRoot::rowCount` to 0 in `allocateNew()` and `clear()`. This makes the behaviour of `VectorSchemaRoot` consistent with `ValueVector` implementations which set their `valueCount` to 0 on `clear()`.",
