        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18209). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMaking ComplexCopier independent of UnionMapWriter lets us use different implementations, like PromotableWriter instead. This helps us to copy map vector with a map value. Otherwise we get the following error:\r\n```java\n\r\nClassCast class org.apache.arrow.vector.complex.impl.PromotableWriter cannot be cast to class org.apache.arrow.vector.complex.impl.UnionMapWriter\n```",
