Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen propagating a Status error up to R, we call `cpp11::stop` which actually has a printf-style syntax.\r\n\r\nWhen our error message contains `'%'` characters, this messes formatting and can trigger Valgrind errors (since the formatting tries to read additional arguments from the C stack).",
