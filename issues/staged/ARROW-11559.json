Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9349#issuecomment-775295349> :\r\n\r\nFlatbuffers is able to encode a virtually unbounded of schema fields in a small buffer size. Verifying that many fields with the Flatbuffers verifier seems to result in potentially unlimited verification times, which is a denial of service risk.\r\n\r\nThe way to mitigate this risk is to pass an appropriate max_tables and/or max_depth limit to the Flatbuffers verifier.",
