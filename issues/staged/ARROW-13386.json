This is not release blocking because CRAN doesn't run rtools35 anymore. We support older rtools so that we can maintain support for more R versions, but I think it is acceptable to degrade functionality for older systems if we must. If there isn't an obvious issue to fix, IMO we should either (1) be sure to disable multithreading on Windows 32-bit R < 4.0, (2) skip these tests/examples on Windows 32-bit R < 4.0, or both."
