Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the query engine we had started to work on a scheduler (ARROW-15079) with some initial PRs but did not end up finishing the work.  We are hoping to start work on this again and, based on new understanding, we won't be following the same approach that was started in ARROW-15079.  We should back out some of those changes (in particular we should not schedule extra thread tasks on map nodes as there is no benefit to doing so).  We still want to keep the basic idea of a map node however.",
