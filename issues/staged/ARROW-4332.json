Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI tried following the instructions for publishing the web site and failed. Issues:\r\n\r\n1. The instructions say to clone the asf-site repo but doesn't say where to clone it to (under arrow repo root dir? under arrow/site dir? somewhere else?)\r\n\r\n2. The instructions don't say which directory to run the bundle command from. It's probably obvious to some people but not me. I'm assuming it should be from arrow/site\r\n\r\n3. The script \"script/sync_format_docs.sh\" seems to be looking in the wrong path and fails.\r\n\r\n4. After manually copying the format docs, jekyll fails to serve the content because there is no IPC.md (there are others, just not IPC) .. looks like IPC is a .rst file not an MD?\r\n\r\nI'll try and figure this out myself and create a PR to fix ....\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
