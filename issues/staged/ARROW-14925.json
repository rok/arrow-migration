One might think it means \"This is deprecated and instead you should open an output stream for appending\"  (e.g. X is deprecated, do Y).\r\n\r\nWe should use wording similar to what is in the C++:\r\n\r\n> Deprecated in 6.0.0. OpenAppendStream is unsupported on several filesystems and will be later removed."
