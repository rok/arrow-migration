        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7396). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee \"MIME types\" thread for details: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b15726d0c0da2223ba1b45a226ef86263f688b20532a30535cd5e267%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n  \\* If we don't register our media types for Apache Arrow formats (IPC File Format and IPC Streaming Format) to IANA, we should use \"x-\" prefix such as \"application/x-apache-arrow-file\".\r\n  \\* It may be better that we reuse the same manner as Apache Thrift. Apache Thrift registers their media types as \"application/vnd.apache.thrift.XXX\". If we use the same manner as Apache Thrift, we will use \"application/vnd.apache.arrow.file\" or something.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n  \\* Decide which media types should we register. (Do we need vote?)\r\n  \\* Register our media types to IANA.\r\n  \\*\\* Media types page: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml\r\n  \\*\\* Application form for new media types: https://www.iana.org/form/media-types\r\n",

According to RFC 6838 (published in January 2013), any use of types in the unregistered tree is strongly discouraged. In addition, subtypes prefixed with\u00a0`x-`\u00a0or\u00a0`X-`\u00a0are no longer considered to be members of this tree._\r\n\r\nThis refers to\u00a0<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838>\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that registring with a vnd prefix is more likely to be accepted at\u00a0<https://www.iana.org/form/media-types>\r\n \\* application/vnd.apache.arrow.file\r\n \\* application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream\r\n\r\nPossibly with an optional parameter for a version?\r\n\r\nI have to serialize Apache Arrow Tables in JSON files and want to store the mime type with it, hence my interest."
