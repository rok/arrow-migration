Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI had an attempt to install [cross-env](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/.github/workflows/js.yml#L108) as suggested by [~paul.e.taylor] but I guess it requires a bit more work.\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n> NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 gulp build\r\n# 'NODE_NO_WARNINGS' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\n# operable program or batch file.\r\n# npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\n# npm ERR! errno 1\r\n# npm ERR! apache-arrow@1.0.0-SNAPSHOT build: `NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 gulp build`\r\n# npm ERR! Exit status 1\r\n# npm ERR!\r\n# npm ERR! Failed at the apache-arrow@1.0.0-SNAPSHOT build script.\r\n# npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above. \n```",
