A `conda install` solved that one. (Should probably be added to the above linked instructions.)\r\n\r\nNow however cmake is complaining about missing llvm.

I believe this is due to a [bug in CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/18924).\r\n\r\nI amended the python developer build instructions such that other novices should have better learning curve in JIRA-6465.\r\n\r\n`[~kou]` Once you finish your PR, could you please remove the warning that I put in the python developer docs about the windows build being currently broken?\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
