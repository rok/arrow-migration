Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `arrow::Column`\u00a0class is missing a method to compare it to other `arrow::Column`\u00a0instances. There should be one implemented in the way the `Equals` implementation is done in the subclasses of `arrow::Array` and is needed to provide a way to compare `arrow::Table`\u00a0instances.",
