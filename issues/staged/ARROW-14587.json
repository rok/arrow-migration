Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince crossbow has a lot of references the checkout step can take a long time, see build https://dev.azure.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/_build/results?buildId=14952&view=logs&j=0da5d1d9-276d-5173-c4c4-9d4d4ed14fdb&t=5bbb8710-d4c1-5a8b-fc80-a388730cf6ac\r\n\r\nWe should alter the azure crossbow template to explicitly check out the task's branch using \r\n` {{ task.branch ` }} jinja variable.\r\n\r\nSee azure documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/multi-repo-checkout?view=azure-devops#checking-out-a-specific-ref",
