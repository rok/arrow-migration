I've tried with limit but it doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nMy parquet file:\u00a0<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aCW7SW2rUVioSePduhgo_91F5-xDMyjp/view?usp=sharing>\r\n\r\ndatafusion-cli:\r\n```java\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE something STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION 'demo.parquet';\r\nselect O_ORDERKEY from something group by O_ORDERKEY;\r\n```\r\n\u00a0",

We have mostly been testing hash aggregates with queries that produce low cardinality results and will need to spend time testing for high cardinality results and see how we can optimize this."
