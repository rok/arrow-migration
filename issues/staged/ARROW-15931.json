Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo be consistent with the main apache/arrow GitHub repository (and other Apache projects), it would be helpful to add explicit Apache LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files to the root of the apache/arrow-site repository. This would help clear up any potential ambiguity around the licensing of the source code for the Apache Arrow website.",
