        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17449](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17449). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI think we can improve interactive use of PyArrow by making the repr of some basic types (Buffer, MemoryPool...) more informative.\r\nSee this session for example:\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> pool = pa.default_memory_pool()\r\n>>> pool\r\n<pyarrow.lib.MemoryPool at 0x7fea126982a0>\r\n>>> pool.backend_name\r\n'jemalloc'\r\n>>> buf = pa.allocate_buffer(1024, memory_pool=pool)\r\n>>> buf\r\n<pyarrow.lib.Buffer at 0x7fea5e51e7b0>\r\n>>> buf.is_cpu\r\nTrue\r\n>>> buf.is_mutable\r\nTrue\r\n>>> buf.size\r\n1024\r\n```\r\n",
