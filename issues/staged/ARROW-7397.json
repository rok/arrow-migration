Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCommit 21ca13a5cd [1] introduces a bug in ConsumeWhitespace() function.\r\nWhen all chars in a string are white spaces, it should return string\r\nlength. But current code returns 0. It's not noticed because x86 goes\r\nrapidjson simd code path which is okay. Arm64 now goes the buggy code\r\npath and triggers json unit test failure.\r\n    \r\n [1] https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/21ca13a5cd9c1478d64370732fcfae72d52350dd#diff-664e724274fbe0ff1e03745aa452b4d6R48\r\n",
