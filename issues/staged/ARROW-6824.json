Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the plasma create API supports creating and sealing a single object \u2013 this makes sense for large objects because their creating throughput is limited by the memory throughput of the client when the data is filled into the buffer. However sometimes we want to create lots of small objects in which case the throughput is limited by the number of IPCs to the store we can do when creating new objects. This can be fixed by offering a version of CreateAndSeal that allows us to create multiple objects at the same time.",
