        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6424](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6424). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe don't get any new fuzzit uploads anymore, see https://circleci.com/gh/ursa-labs/crossbow/2296 for details. Seems like the binary is not found anymore:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n...\r\n+ pushd /build/cpp\r\n/build/cpp /\r\n+ mkdir ./relwithdebinfo/out\r\n+ cp ./relwithdebinfo/arrow-ipc-fuzzing-test ./relwithdebinfo/out/fuzzer\r\ncp: cannot stat './relwithdebinfo/arrow-ipc-fuzzing-test': No such file or directory\r\nExited with code 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at https://github.com/ursa-labs/crossbow/branches/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=fuzzit , it seems it is broken as of the 19th of August, and very likely due to [438a140142be423b1b2af2399567a0a8aeba9aa1](https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/438a140142be423b1b2af2399567a0a8aeba9aa1).",
