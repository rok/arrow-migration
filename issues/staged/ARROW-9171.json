        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9171](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9171). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen you try to find out how to use Arrow from a third-party project, you may read the comments in FindArrow.cmake:\r\n```Java\n\r\n# This module defines\r\n#  ARROW_FOUND, whether Arrow has been found\r\n#  ARROW_FULL_SO_VERSION, full shared object version of found Arrow \"100.0.0\"\r\n#  ARROW_IMPORT_LIB, path to libarrow's import library (Windows only)\r\n#  ARROW_INCLUDE_DIR, directory containing headers\r\n#  ARROW_LIBS, deprecated. Use ARROW_LIB_DIR instead\r\n#  ARROW_LIB_DIR, directory containing Arrow libraries\r\n#  ARROW_SHARED_IMP_LIB, deprecated. Use ARROW_IMPORT_LIB instead\r\n#  ARROW_SHARED_LIB, path to libarrow's shared library\r\n#  ARROW_SO_VERSION, shared object version of found Arrow such as \"100\"\r\n#  ARROW_STATIC_LIB, path to libarrow.a\r\n#  ARROW_VERSION, version of found Arrow\r\n#  ARROW_VERSION_MAJOR, major version of found Arrow\r\n#  ARROW_VERSION_MINOR, minor version of found Arrow\r\n#  ARROW_VERSION_PATCH, patch version of found Arrow\r\n```\r\n\r\n... only to find out that `find_package(Arrow)` doesn't set most of those variables:\r\n- it sets `Arrow_FOUND`, not `ARROW_FOUND`\n- `ARROW_INCLUDE_DIR`, `ARROW_SHARED_LIB`, `ARROW_STATIC_LIB` are not set\n- to link with Arrow C++, you have to link with either `arrow_shared` or `arrow_static`\n  \n  Also, I wonder if Arrow should follow the more recent convention of naming its targets e.g. `Arrow::Arrow` or `arrow::arrow` (or specifically `arrow::shared`).",
