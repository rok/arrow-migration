Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince ARROW-15058 running the Java benchmarks results in stdout logs that are extremely large (we're seeing them at ~14gb). This is disrupting running benchmarks on conbench.\r\n\r\nWe've temporarily worked around this by disabling stdout logging entirely, but this will make debugging issues in the future much harder.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to reduce the volume of stdout logging when running these benchmarks?\r\n\r\ncc `[~dsusanibara]` [~fan_li_ya]",
