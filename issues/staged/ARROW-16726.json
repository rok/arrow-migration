        "title": "[Python] Setuptools warnings about installing packages as data",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16726](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16726). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThese warnings have started appearing in some builds (such as when running `archery docker run conda-python-docs`):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nSetuptoolsDeprecationWarning:     Installing 'pyarrow.includes' as data is deprecated, please list it in `packages`.\r\n      !!\r\n\r\n\r\n      ############################\r\n# Package would be ignored #\r\n      ############################\r\n      Python recognizes 'pyarrow.includes' as an importable package, however it is\r\n      included in the distribution as \"data\".\r\n      This behavior is likely to change in future versions of setuptools (and\r\n      therefore is considered deprecated).\r\n\r\n      Please make sure that 'pyarrow.includes' is included as a package by using\r\n      setuptools' `packages` configuration field or the proper discovery methods\r\n      (for example by using `find_namespace_packages(...)`/`find_namespace:`\r\n      instead of `find_packages(...)`/`find:`).\r\n\r\n      You can read more about \"package discovery\" and \"data files\" on setuptools\r\n      documentation page.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should probably fix them before something really breaks.",
