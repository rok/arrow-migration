Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI changed the LZ4's CMake target name to `lz4::lz4` from `LZ4::lz4` by ARROW-16614 because I thought that the official LZ4's CMake package uses `lz4::lz4` not `LZ4::lz4`.\r\n\r\nBut I was wrong. The official LZ4's CMake package uses `LZ4::lz4` not `lz4::lz4`: https://github.com/lz4/lz4/commit/f9378137ed306ea71d1d9cd60e1acf7b8e57f0df",
