Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow format supports dictionaries being re-used across multiple columns. At present, neither reading nor writing these is supported from C++ (and thus Python).\u00a0\r\n\r\nSupport for writing these would require extending the interfaces, but reading might be a relatively quick win - and this issue is concerned with the latter only.\r\n\r\nThe Java implementation supports writing, so can be used to generate test data.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOnce the C++ side is handled, pyarrow should automatically be able to convert such tables to pandas, with appropriate use of categoricals. This should also be verified, and otherwise addressed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
