        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12620](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12620). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI discovered this while working on https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10191. You can project new columns when writing a dataset, but only if they are derived from columns that are included in the output. Here's an R-based example:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n# Simple function to write and re-open the new dataset\r\nwrite_then_open <- function(ds, path, ...) {\r\n  write_dataset(ds, path, ...)\r\n  open_dataset(path)\r\n}\r\n\r\ntab <- Table$create(a = 1:5)\r\n\r\ntab %>% \r\n  write_then_open(ds_dir) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n\r\n# # A tibble: 5 x 1\r\n#       a\r\n#   <int>\r\n# 1     1\r\n# 2     2\r\n# 3     3\r\n# 4     4\r\n# 5     5\r\n\r\n# If you rename a column, it's all nulls\r\ntab %>%\r\n  select(b = a) %>%\r\n  write_then_open(ds_dir) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n\r\n# # A tibble: 5 x 1\r\n#       b\r\n#   <int>\r\n# 1    NA\r\n# 2    NA\r\n# 3    NA\r\n# 4    NA\r\n# 5    NA\r\n\r\n# If you derive a new column and keep the original, it works\r\ntab %>%\r\n  mutate(b = a) %>%\r\n  write_then_open(ds_dir) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n\r\n# # A tibble: 5 x 2\r\n#       a     b\r\n#   <int> <int>\r\n# 1     1     1\r\n# 2     2     2\r\n# 3     3     3\r\n# 4     4     4\r\n# 5     5     5\r\n\r\n# transmute() only keeps the added columns, so it also illustrates the failure\r\ntab %>%\r\n  transmute(b = a) %>%\r\n  write_then_open(ds_dir) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n\r\n# # A tibble: 5 x 1\r\n#       b\r\n#   <int>\r\n# 1    NA\r\n# 2    NA\r\n# 3    NA\r\n# 4    NA\r\n# 5    NA\r\n```",
