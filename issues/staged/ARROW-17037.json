Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`arrow/util/utf8.h` exposes both extern functions and inlined functions, the latter being dependent on xsimd. For consumption of the extern utilities from third-party code, we should split it in two so that xsimd does not have to be present when building.",
