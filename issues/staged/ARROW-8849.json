Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor example in the 0.17.1 release notes show 27 commits while the jira release only contains 19 patches. This is because the release specific commits (like the versions bumbs) are also accumulated.\r\n\r\nSee the patch release notes here https://github.com/apache/arrow-site/pull/59/files",
