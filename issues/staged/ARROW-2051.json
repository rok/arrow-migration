Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUUID objects can be easily supported and can be represented as 128-bit integers or a stream of bytes.\r\n\r\nThe fastest way I know to construct a UUID object is by using it's 128-bit (16 bytes) integer representation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n%timeit uuid.UUID(int=24197857161011715162171839636988778104)\r\n611 ns \u00b1 6.27 ns per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)\r\n%timeit uuid.UUID(bytes=b'\\x124Vx\\x124Vx\\x124Vx\\x124Vx')\r\n1.17 \u00b5s \u00b1 7.5 ns per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)\r\n%timeit uuid.UUID('12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678')\r\n1.47 \u00b5s \u00b1 6.08 ns per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRight now I have to do this manually which is pretty tedious.",

To provide a way to construct an array of UUIDs from python objects? The exact proposed enhancement is not fully clear to me.\r\n\r\nBut, I would say, as long as we have no UUID type in Arrow (or an extension type, not sure if there are any plans on that), construction methods for UUID seems out of scope for pyarrow to me. \r\n\r\n"

We do have fixed-size binary data.\r\n2) Arrow now has extension types, so you could probably implement a UUID extension type (though the Python API for extension types may still be in flux).\r\n3) The answer to \"why not...\" questions generally is that it costs maintenance time for us, so unless some contributor (such as you) wants to bear the maintenance cost it probably won't happen if we don't find it useful enough.\r\n"
