Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer discussion on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyTdLU-RxA-Gsb9EsYnrQrmqPMOYMfPlWwxRi1Is1tQ\r\n\r\nAdd an ExecNode interface with which a streaming execution graph can be constructed. Initial concrete classes will include:\r\n- ScanNode, which wraps a dataset and is a pure emitter of batches (initially, this will only wrap memory sized datasets such as tables. See ARROW-11930)\n- FilterNode, which evaluates an expression on inputs and based on the result removes rows from batches (eventually, this may defer materialization of the selection to other kernels. See ARROW-5005 ARROW-10474)\n- ProjectNode, which evaluates expressions on inputs producing new columns.\n- GroupedAggregateNode, which computes aggregations grouped on one or more keys.\n",
