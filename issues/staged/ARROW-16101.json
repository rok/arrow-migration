Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `arrow::fs::FileSystem` interface is partially documented but it is missing docstrings and has some comments like \"same as above\" which cause the resulting documentation to be a bit harder to read.\r\n\r\nWe should go through and make a pass at cleaning this up.",
