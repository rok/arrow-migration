Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the context of ListArrays, \"values\" indicates the elements in a slot of the ListArray. Since MapArray isa ListArray, \"values\" indicates the same thing and the elements are key-item pairs. This naming scheme is not idiomatic; these **should** be called key-value pairs but that would require propagating the renaming down to ListArray.",

As it is, \"value\" is used for both purposes,\r\n[**in the same sentence** of Layout.rst.](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/format/Layout.rst#list-type)\r\n\r\nUsing \"values\" in the context of Map is probably unavoidable due to the very\r\nstrong convention of naming elements of the range and domain of a mapping its\r\n\"keys\" and \"values\". (A related Python-specific convention is to name the sequence\r\nof key-value pairs \"items\", as in `dict`.)\r\n\r\nHowever by renaming `ListArray::values` at least we can avoid collision between the\r\nexpectation that `map_array.values()` will yield the array of all mapped values\r\nand the reality that it will return the array of key-value pairs, and without adding a prefix."

Code which handles both map and list could be adapted with minimal boilerplate by adding\r\n`std::shared_ptr<Array> MapArray::\\{To,From\\}KeyValuePairs()`\r\n(which will also have minimal runtime overhead since the structures of Map and List arrays are identical)"
