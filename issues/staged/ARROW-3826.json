Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the discussion for https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2982 I saw that the cache for master is over 3GB. I'm curious if maintaining such a large cache is inflating our test times",
