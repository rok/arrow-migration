        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8208](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8208). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello,\r\n\r\nI tried to use the row_group filtering at the file level with an instance of ParquetDataset without success.\r\n\r\nI've tested the workaround proposed here:\r\n <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/26551#issuecomment-497039883>\r\n\r\nBut I wonder if it can work on a file as I get an exception with the following code:\r\n```python\n\r\nParquetDataset('data.parquet',\r\n               filters=[('ticker', '=', 'AAPL')]).read().to_pandas()\r\n```\r\n```\n\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'filter_accepts_partition'\r\n```\r\nI read the documentation, and the filtering seems to work only on partitioned dataset. Moreover I read some information in the following JIRA ticket: ARROW-1796\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure that a ParquetDataset can use row_group statistics to filter specific row_group in a file (in a dataset or not)?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in ARROW-1796, I tried with fastparquet, and after fixing a bug (statistics.min instead of statistics.min_value), I was able to apply the row_group filtering.\r\n\r\nToday I'm forced with pyarrow to filter manually the row_groups in each file, which prevents me to use the ParquetDataset partition filtering functionality.\r\n\r\nThe row groups are really useful because it prevents to fill the filesystem with small files...",

In the upcoming pyarrow 0.17, we will also provide this functionality through the existing `ParquetDataset` API as you were using. But this is work in progress right now (ARROW-8039, https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6303)"
