        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6273](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6273). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe parquet to arrow read path is likely the most commonly used one (esp. by pyarrow) and is a closed step that should allow us to fuzz the reading of untrusted parquet files into memory. This complements the existing arrow ipc fuzzer.",
