Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere's an undefined constructor property definition in the `Object.assign()` call for the BigNum mixins that's overriding the constructor of the returned TypedArrays. I think this was left over from the first iteration where I used `Object.create()`. These should be removed.",
