Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe experimental `map_batches()` function is broken. The\u00a0[one test for it](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/f8f2617d46e49616ab325e46542cf746293d0ebc/r/tests/testthat/test-dataset.R#L623-L636) has not been failing only because it calls the `min()` function which had no binding and thus triggered `abandon_ship()` to throw a warning and pull the data into R, preempting the error that would have happened later.",
