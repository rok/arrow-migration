Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImplement `contains` for exact matches of subportions of a string. Using the Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm, we should be able to do this in a linear runtime with a tiny bit of preprocessing at the invocation.",

Afterwards, we can have a look into Booyer-Moore or others and have a look at the benchmarks. One nice aspect is that we only need to preprocess once but can apply it then to all elements of the array."
