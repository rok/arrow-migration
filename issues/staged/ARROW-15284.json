Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nVia platform-specific functions like `pthread_setname_np` and `SetThreadDescription` we can assign names to threads that will be visible in debuggers, which can help debug async code where it's otherwise difficult to tell what thread pool a thread is part of.",
