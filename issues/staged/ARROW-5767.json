        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5767](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5767). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe permit dictionaries to grow using the `isDelta` property in the IPC protocol. I think it should be allowed for the same dictionary ID to appear in an IPC protocol stream but with `isDelta=false`. This would indicate that the dictionary in that message is to replace any prior-observed ones in subsequent record batches.\r\n\r\nFor example, we might have dictionary batches in a stream:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nid: 0 isDelta: false values: [a, b, c]\r\nid: 0 isDelta: true values [d]\r\nid 0 isDelta: false values [c, a, b]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuch data could easily be produced by a stream producer that is creating dictionaries in different execution threads.
