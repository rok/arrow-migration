        "title": "[C++] Compilation error when linking arrow-flight-perf-server",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8587](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8587). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI wanted to play around with Flight benchmark after seeing the discussion regarding Flight's throughput in arrow dev mailing list today.\r\n\r\nI met the following error when trying to build the benchmark from latest source code:\r\n```java\n\r\n[ 95%] Linking CXX executable ../../../debug/arrow-flight-perf-server\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight_testing.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::detail::canonical(boost::filesystem::path const&, boost::filesystem::path const&, boost::system::error_code*)'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight_testing.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `boost::system::system_category()'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight_testing.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::path::parent_path() const'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `deflate'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `deflateEnd'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight_testing.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `boost::system::generic_category()'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight_testing.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::detail::current_path(boost::system::error_code*)'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `inflateInit2_'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `inflate'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `deflateInit2_'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `inflateEnd'\r\n../../../debug/libarrow_flight_testing.so.18.0.0: undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::path::operator/=(boost::filesystem::path const&)'\r\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\nsrc/arrow/flight/CMakeFiles/arrow-flight-perf-server.dir/build.make:154: recipe for target 'debug/arrow-flight-perf-server' failed\r\nmake[2]: *** [debug/arrow-flight-perf-server] Error 1\r\nCMakeFiles/Makefile2:2609: recipe for target 'src/arrow/flight/CMakeFiles/arrow-flight-perf-server.dir/all' failed\r\nmake[1]: *** [src/arrow/flight/CMakeFiles/arrow-flight-perf-server.dir/all] Error 2\r\nMakefile:140: recipe for target 'all' failed\r\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\r\n\r\n```\r\nI was using `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=AUTO -DARROW_FLIGHT=ON -DARROW_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON -DARROW_CXXFLAGS=\"-lboost_filesystem -lboost_system\"` to configure the build.\r\n I noticed that there was a `ARROW_BOOST_BUILD_VERSION: 1.71.0` in the output, but the Boost library that I installed from the package manger was of this version: `1.65.1.0ubuntu1`. Could this be the cause of the problem?\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nI was able to build the benchmark [before](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7200). It was on AWS with the OS being ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-20191002, which should be very similar to the one I'm using on my laptop.",
