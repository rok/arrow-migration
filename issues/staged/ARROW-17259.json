Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt turns out we generate a ton of code just copying and manipulating `shared_ptr<DataType>` throughput arrow/compute, and especially in the configuration of the function/kernels registry. One function `RegisterScalarArithmetic` generates around 300kb of code, which on looking at disassembly contains a significant amount of inlined shared_ptr template code. I made an attempt to refactoring things to use `const DataType*` for function signatures which removes quite a bit of code bloat, and puts us on a path to using fewer shared_ptr's in general",
