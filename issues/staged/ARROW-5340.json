Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs follow-on work to ARROW-3144, there are cases where a dictionary may be shared by multiple fields in a RecordBatch. \r\n\r\nThe presumption of `arrow::ipc::DictionaryMemo` is that there is a 1-to-1 mapping between fields and dictionaries, and dictionary id assignment occurs prior to observing the dictionaries (to know whether or not they are used multiple times), so it may not be feasible, or at least not easy.",
