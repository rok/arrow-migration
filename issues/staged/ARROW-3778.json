Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`test-util.h` is included in most (all?) test files, and it's quite long to compile because it includes many other files and recompiles helper functions all the time. Instead we should have only declarations in `test-util.h` and put implementations in a separate `.cc` file.",
