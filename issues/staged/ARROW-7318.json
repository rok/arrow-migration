Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n**TimestampArray** throws during deserialization from a record batch previously serialized with the library. This appears to be because the timezone is not serialized for **TimestampType** in the Flatbuffer serialization implementation.\r\n\r\nThis does not appear in the round-trip serialization tests because the **TimestampArray**\u00a0field is omitted from the test data, along with other parametric types.",
