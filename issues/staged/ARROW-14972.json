Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a dataset is using the hive partitioning scheme the partitioning can be automatically discovered.  If it is using the directory partitioning scheme it will not be automatically discovered.  This has led to [some confusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/11826) and should be documented.",
