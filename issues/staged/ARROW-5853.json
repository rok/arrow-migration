I think I have something partially working but I am wondering what the expected behavior is if you pass something like an integer array as the filter.\r\n\r\nWhen I passed it an integer array of 0s and 1s\u00a0I get a seg fault. My C++ is pretty rusty but in poking around in 'filter.cc' I suspect it may be something related to the 'checked_pointer_cast' in 'FilterKernel::Call'.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like there are any C++ tests with an array other than BooleanArray. Should this function check that the Array is boolean and throw a type error if it isn't or should this be doing a different cast?"

We intentionally aren't including a lot of runtime (in release mode) type checks or other checks in the kernels, since the idea is that such type checking should have occurred at a higher level"
