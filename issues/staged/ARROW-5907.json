        "title": "[Python] base64 support of bytes-like",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5907](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5907). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently pyarrow could not be encoded by base64:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nt = numpy.arange(25, dtype=np.float64)\r\na = pyarrow.array(t)\r\n\r\ns1 = base64.b64encode(t) # this works\r\ns2 = base64.b64encode(a)\r\n```\r\n\r\ngives \"a bytes-like object is required not 'pyarrow.lib.DoubleArray'\"\r\n\r\nBecause it is not bytes-like\r\n\r\nA possible scenario could be if we want to push data(like ndarray) to Redis in Python and get it from other language like Java. Arrow could be used to interact between Python and Java using Array of Arrow.\r\n\r\nAdding this feature would support some in-queue and out-queue operations like Redis",

However, Arrays are not necessarily exactly fitting the buffer protocol (additional buffer for the nulls, can be nested, ..) unlike the Tensors. So not sure that should be done? Or only for primitive arrays without null, how zero-copy conversion to numpy is limited to those cases.\r\n\r\nThat last part is actually a work-around, you can convert the pyarrow Array to a numpy array without copying data with `a.to_numpy()` (it's a view, if it needs to copy it will raise an error), and then pass that to the function that needs a bytes-like object."
