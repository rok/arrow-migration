        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7940](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7940). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Install conda-forge as described here: <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/windows.html#using-conda-forge-for-build-dependencies>\n1. Install ninja+clcache <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/windows.html#building-with-ninja-and-clcache>\n1. (git bash) git clone <https://github.com/apache/arrow.git>\n   cd arrow/\n   git checkout apache-arrow-0.16.0\n1. (cmd)\n   call C:\\Users\\vvv\\Miniconda3\\Scripts\\activate.bat C:\\Users\\vvv\\Miniconda3\n   call \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64\n   call conda activate arrow-dev\n1. cd arrow\\cpp\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n1. cmake -G \"Ninja\" -DARROW_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DARROW_BUILD_UTILITIES=ON -DARROW_FLIGHT=ON -DARROW_GANDIVA=ON -DARROW_PARQUET=ON ..\n1. cmake --build . --config Release\n   \n   Expected results: Examples, utilities, flight, gandiva, parquet built.\n   \n   Actual results: Default configuration and none of the above built. cmake_summary.json indicates all these features OFF. Following lines in the output of cmake:\n   ```java\n   \n   -- Configuring done\n   You have changed variables that require your cache to be deleted.\n   Configure will be re-run and you may have to reset some variables.\n   The following variables have changed:\n   CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER= C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2019/BuildTools/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.24.28314/bin/Hostx64/x64/cl.exe\n   -- Building using CMake version: 3.16.4 \n   ```\n   Full cmake output attached",

I guess that the problem occurs at the earlier step (6) - cmake re -runs the configuration step and 'forgets' all the custom settings specified in the command line."

Removing this piece of code entirely\n1. Documenting that clcache should be explicitly specified via command line or environment: \n   \n   ```java\n   \n   cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clcache -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clcache ... \n   ```\n   or, alternatively\n   \n   ```java\n   \n   set CC=clcache\n   set CXX=clcache\n   cmake ... \n   ```\n   \n   \u00a0"
