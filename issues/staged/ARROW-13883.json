        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13883](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13883). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment we only allow using `numpy` arrays for masks when building new arrays. It would be helpful to allow using a `pyarrow.Array` too so that the user has more flexibility and we can avoid involving `numpy` in documentation examples for the sole purpose of creating masks.",
