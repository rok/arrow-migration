        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1660](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1660). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have the following scala case class to store sparse matrix data to read it later using python\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\ncase class CooVector(\r\n    id: Int,\r\n    row_ids: Seq[Int],\r\n    rowsIdx: Seq[Int],\r\n    colIdx: Seq[Int],\r\n    data: Seq[Double])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI save the dataset of this type to multiple parquet files using spark and then read it using pyarrow.parquet and convert the result to pandas dataset.\r\n\r\nThe problem i have is that some values end up in wrong rows, for example, row_ids might end up in wrong cooVector row. I have no idea what the reason is but might be it is related to the fact that the fields are of variable sizes. And everything is correct if i read it using spark. Also i checked to_pydict method and the result is correct, so seems like the problem somewhere in to_pandas method.",

There was a bug ARROW-1357 that was fixed that would cause the issue you were seeing. I'm a bit at a loss since the relevant test case is https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/tests/test_convert_pandas.py#L600. I will move off the 0.8.0 milestone, but leave the issue open in case you can find a repro"

I had the same intuition that this issue might be related to splicing, because my initial dataset was ordered by id field and top of the dataset (after to_pandas) was something like this 10012, 10015, 10034, and the row with id like 10018 had values from 100034 and only part of them at least in one column (and if i remember well 10018 was the exact third id by ascendence."
