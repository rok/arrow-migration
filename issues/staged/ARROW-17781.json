Just an FYI, it makes it a little bit easier to diagnose these issues if you supply a short reproducible code example (like the one I'm about to paste below), rather than a screenshot of the code.  However, no problem here, as I think I know what the issue is!\r\n\r\nIn version 9.0.0 we don't yet support the ability to call functions in Arrow with their package prefix.  If you call it just as `floor_date` instead of `lubridate::floor_date()`, this should hopefully work.  I've pasted a short reproducible example for you below.\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\n\r\ndf <- tibble::tibble(x = as.POSIXct(\"2022-09-20 14:40:46 BST\"))\r\n\r\ndf %>%\r\n  arrow_table() %>%\r\n  mutate(t = floor_date(x, unit = \"15 min\")) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n#> # A tibble: 1 \u00d7 2\r\n#>   x                   t                  \r\n#>   <dttm>              <dttm>             \r\n#> 1 2022-09-20 14:40:46 2022-09-20 14:30:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn version 10.0.0 we'll be supporting the ability to call functions including the package prefix - this was completed in the dev version in ARROW-14575."
