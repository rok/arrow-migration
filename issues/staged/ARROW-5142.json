        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5142](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5142). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur `.bat` files for AppVeyor CI use \"`conda`\" to execute Conda commands, unfortunately those exit the `.bat` script immediately after returning. We need to invoke Conda using \"`call conda`\" instead. However, doing so exposes a bug in the wheel tests that went unnoticed.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4015\r\n",
