        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10753](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10753). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNegative numbers in SQL WHERE clauses are not parsed correctly:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n> create external table blogs stored as PARQUET location '../../testing/data/parquet/generated_simple_numerics/blogs.par0 rows in set. Query took 0 seconds.\r\n> select reply, blog_id from blogs where blog_id >= -1000;\r\nInternalError(\"SQL binary operator cannot be interpreted as a unary operator\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above can be seen with different data files, and with both integer and floating point negative numbers. \u00a0 \u00a0The exception comes from planner.rs sql_to_rex() function, in the UnaryOp case, so it is data independent. \u00a0 `[~jorgecarleitao]` \u00a0 seems you have made commits here, WDYT?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the problem is SQLParser itself but the fix seems quite easy, basically to parse this:\r\n\r\nUnaryOp \\{ op: Minus, expr: Value(Number(\"1\")) }\r\n\r\nIt can be seen in latest master also.\r\n\r\nI'm up for contributing a fix if this is confirmed as a bug.",
