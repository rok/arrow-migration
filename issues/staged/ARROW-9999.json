        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9999](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9999). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```python\n\r\npa.array([\"some\", \"string\"], type=pa.dictionary(pa.int8(), pa.string)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nraises\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nArrowNotImplementedError: Sequence converter for type dictionary<values=string, indices=int8, ordered=0> not implemented\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be a much more comfortable way than\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\npa.DictionaryArray.from_arrays(indices, dictionary)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd possibly more efficient as well thanks to the adaptive dictionary builders.",
