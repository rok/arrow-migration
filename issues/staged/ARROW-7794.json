Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRunning \"cargo publish\" for the arrow-flight crate resulted in this error:\r\n```java\n\r\nerror: failed to run custom build command for `arrow-flight v0.16.0 (/home/andy/apache-arrow-0.16.0/rust/target/package/arrow-flight-0.16.0)`Caused by:\r\n  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/andy/apache-arrow-0.16.0/rust/target/package/arrow-flight-0.16.0/target/debug/build/arrow-flight-1b2906a3933d2832/build-script-build` (exit code: 1)\r\n--- stderr\r\nError: Custom { kind: Other, error: \"protoc failed: ../../format: warning: directory does not exist.\\nCould not make proto path relative: ../../format/Flight.proto: No such file or directory\\n\" }\r\n \n```\r\nThe workaround was to edit the build.rs and make the path absolute and then run \"cargo publish --allow-dirty\", but we should find a better solution before the next release.",
