Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn a few places we have functionality which must be non-trivially initialized before use, including the compute function and exec node factory registries. Rather than requiring developers to remember to call `InitializeUTF8()`, it'd be better to provide a way to declare on-load code.",
