Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n**Umbrella Ticket for the work related to serving multiple versions of R docs**\r\n\r\nThe Python, Java and C++ documentation have support for serving multiple versions of the docs and switching between them thanks to the newly added version switcher. The same doesn't apply to the R docs as they are not implemented in Sphinx and thus can't benefit from the version switcher implemented for Sphinx.\r\n\r\nWe should provide an equivalent version switcher for the R docs.",
