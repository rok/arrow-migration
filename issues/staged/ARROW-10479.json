Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn classes related to Decimal types: [DecimalArray](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/9f13810d4407d1e2fd83a975c4eb281693e2ca9c/cpp/src/arrow/array/array_decimal.cc#L35), [DecimalBuilder](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/9f13810d4407d1e2fd83a975c4eb281693e2ca9c/cpp/src/arrow/array/builder_decimal.cc#L38), [DecimalType](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/9f13810d4407d1e2fd83a975c4eb281693e2ca9c/cpp/src/arrow/type.h#L879), etc, there is a lot of code duplications between decimals with different bit widths.\r\n\r\nThe proposal here is to create base classes for them, that will contain common logic for decimals of all bit widths.\r\n\r\nThese changes should simplify adding of new width decimals to C++ part.",
