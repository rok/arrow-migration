Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRepeated calls to FindRE2.cmake try to recreate the exisiting target `RE2::re2` which is prohibited by CMake and fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nCMake Warning (dev) at C:/Miniconda37-x64/envs/arrow/Library/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):\r\n  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (RE2) does\r\n  not match the name of the calling package (re2).  This can lead to problems\r\n  in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables (e.g.,\r\n  `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  cmake_modules/FindRE2.cmake:63 (find_package_handle_standard_args)\r\n  C:/Miniconda37-x64/envs/arrow/Library/lib/cmake/grpc/gRPCConfig.cmake:21 (find_package)\r\n  cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake:2472 (find_package)\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:495 (include)\r\nThis warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.\r\nCMake Error at cmake_modules/FindRE2.cmake:66 (add_library):\r\n  add_library cannot create imported target \"RE2::re2\" because another target\r\n  with the same name already exists.\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  C:/Miniconda37-x64/envs/arrow/Library/lib/cmake/grpc/gRPCConfig.cmake:21 (find_package)\r\n  cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake:2472 (find_package)\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:495 (include)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this issue only occurs currently on case-insensitive file systems when ARROW_FLIGHT=ON is set.",
