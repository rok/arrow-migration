        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18066](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18066). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the Python documentation for [Test Groups](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/developers/python.html#test-groups)\u00a0it's stated:\r\n> We have many tests that are grouped together using pytest marks. Some of these are disabled by default. To enable a test group, pass --$GROUP_NAME, e.g. --parquet. [continues]\r\nHowever, I get:\r\n\r\n`$ pytest --parquet # from arrow/python dir`\r\n`ERROR: usage: pytest [options] [file_or_dir] [file_or_dir] [...]`\r\n`pytest: error: unrecognized arguments: --parquet`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAm I interpreting the docs wrong or has something changed since writing the docs?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRelated: `pytest --markers` only reports the full list of pytest Marks when I'm in the `arrow/python/pyarrow` directory but not `arrow/python`. When I'm in the `arrow/python/pyarrow` subdirectory, marks work as expected (ie `pytest -m parquet works`).",
