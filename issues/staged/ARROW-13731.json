However, other things we should consider separately:\r\n- do we want to provide instructions for working with the lower-level Arrow objects available in R and calling their methods directly? I think this depends on our target audience\n- do we want to include a chapter on working with Dataset objects and discuss the differences between Tables and Datasets? I think so"
