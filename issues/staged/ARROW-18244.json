If you can install a nightly version of the package and confirm, that would be great. \r\n\r\n`str_replace` does work if the replacement is a string, but `NA` is logical, and this fails in regular stringr too:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n> data.frame(x=\"a\") %>% mutate(y = str_replace(x, \"a\", NA))\r\nError in `mutate()`:\r\n!

Could you please open a new issue for that? Thanks!"
