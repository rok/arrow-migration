        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4009](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4009). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, we run Valgrind on a coverage-enabled C++ build on Travis-CI. This means the slowness of Valgrind acts as a multiplier of the overhead of outputting coverage information using the instrumentation added by the compiler.\r\n\r\nInstead we should probably emit C++ (and Python) coverage information in a different Travis-CI build without Valgrind enabled.",
