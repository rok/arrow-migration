Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed this while working on Flight integration tests. FlightService keeps an executor, which can hang the JVM on shutdown if the executor itself is not shut down.\r\n\r\nIt's used by Handshake and DoPut.\r\n\r\nI think this surfaced because I wrote an AuthHandler that threw an exception.",
