Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have tried to add a new self-hosted runner at crossbow which is not an M1. The problem is that some of the M1 jobs where scheduled on this node because we are only tagging them with `runs-on: self-hosted`. The idea of this PR is to be a little more specific and tag them also with the OS and architecture as defined on github guidelines:\r\n<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow>\r\n\r\nAn example of a job that failed and was scheduled to a Linux k8s node is here:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/6789533822?check_suite_focus=true>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
