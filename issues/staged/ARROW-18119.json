        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18119](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18119). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis would look something like:\r\n\r\nEnsureAligned(Buffer|Array|ChunkedArray|RecordBatch|Table, int minimum_alignment, MemoryPool\\* memory_pool);\r\n\r\nIt would fail if MemoryPool's alignment < minimum_alignment\r\nIt would iterate through each buffer of the object, if the object is not aligned properly, it would reallocate and copy the buffer (using memory_pool)\r\n\r\nIt would return a new object where every buffer is guaranteed to meet the alignment requirements.",
