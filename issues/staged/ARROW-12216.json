Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRTools 3.5 (on Windows, possibly only on 32 bit) does not seem to support multithreading very well.\u00a0 The tests have multithreading disabled.\u00a0 Perhaps it is worth turning off multithreading proactively to avoid users running into errors and being stumped for a while before figuring it out.",
