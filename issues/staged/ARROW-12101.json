Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI often come across the need to store single-valued columns. The current Arrow format doesn't have an efficient way to represent these, I believe. One possible improvement would be to introduce an int0 type (where all values are 0) that, like null, does not have a buffer allocated. Then this could be used as an index into a Dictionary with a single value.\r\n\r\nFor low cardinality columns, I also often find myself wishing for int1, int2, and int4 types to use as an index.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
