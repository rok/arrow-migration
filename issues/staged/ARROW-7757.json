Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, a user seeking to add a `Builder<T>` class to their user-defined type in C# can subclass `PrimitiveArrayBuilder` since it is marked `public abstract`. However, it's parameterless constructor is marked as `internal` making it impossible to compile the user's class.\r\n\r\nThe preferred solution would be to mark this constructor as `public`. If this cannot be done for some reason, the entire\u00a0<font color=\"#172b4d\">`</font><font color=\"#172b4d\">PrimitiveArrayBuilder</font><font color=\"#172b4d\">`</font> class should be marked `internal` to avoid confusion.",
