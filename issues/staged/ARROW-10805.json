        "title": "[C++] CSV reader: option to ignore trailing delimiters",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10805](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10805). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt is not uncommon to have a CSV file that has \"trailing\" delimiters. \r\n\r\nFor example, I ran into something like this:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n1|2|3|\r\n4|5|6|\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere we currently detect 4 columns. If you want to properly read this in while passing the column names, you need to add a \"dummy\" column name for the non-existing last column (and specify the actual column names to `include_columns` to drop it again):\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\ncolumn_names = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\r\n\r\ncsv.read_csv(\r\n    \"path/to/dile.csv\",\r\n    read_options=csv.ReadOptions(column_names=column_names + [\"dummy\"]),\r\n    parse_options=csv.ParseOptions(delimiter=\"|\"),\r\n    convert_options=csv.ConvertOptions(include_columns=column_names)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPandas has indirect support for it through the `index_col=False` option (see https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#index-columns-and-trailing-delimiters, i.e. when the length of the names is 1 shorter as the detected number of columns and this last column is all empty, it will drop this)\r\n\r\nAlthough the above provides a workaround, it might be nice to have out of the box support for it.
