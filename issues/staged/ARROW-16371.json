Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen a table is created without any data and an iterator is requested I would expect to get an empty iterator that just returns that it's done.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n```json\n\r\n{\"value\": null, \"done\": true}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the code fails in `strideForType()` with `Uncaught TypeError: type2 is undefined`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\n\r\nschema = new arrow.Schema(dataType.children)\r\ndata = new arrow.Table(this.schema)\r\n\r\nconst iter = data[Symbol.iterator]()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the [table just creates a new vector with its data](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/e9481532e93e4f29a1c2c322e00f268d6cd9f534/js/src/table.ts#L227) and then the [`strideForType` method fails](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/e9481532e93e4f29a1c2c322e00f268d6cd9f534/js/src/type.ts#L652).",
