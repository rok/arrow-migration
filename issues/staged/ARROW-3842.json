        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3842](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3842). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo support the \"Writing and Reading Streams\" section of the vignette, perhaps we should rely more on the RecordBatchStreamWriter class and less the `write_record_batch` function. \r\n\r\nWe should be able to write code resembling the python api : \r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nbatch <- ... \r\nsink <- buffer_output_stream()\r\nwriter <- record_batch_stream_writer(sink, batch$schema())\r\nwriter$write_batch()\r\nwriter$close()\r\nsink$getvalue()\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost of the code is there, but we need to add \r\n\r\n- RecordBatchStreamWriter$write_batch() : write a record batch to the stream. We already have RecordBatchStreamWriter$WriteRecordBatch\n- RecordBatchStreamWriter$close() : not sure why it is lower case close() in python but upper case in C++. We already have RecordBatchWriter$Close()\n- BufferOutputStream$getvalue() : we already have BufferOutputStream$Finish()\n  \n  Currently the constructor for a BufferOutputStream is buffer_output_stream(), perhaps we can align with python and make it BufferOutputStream, that would not clash with the `arrow::BufferOutputStream` class because of the namespacing. \n  \n  \n",
