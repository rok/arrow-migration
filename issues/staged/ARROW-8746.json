(use-cases include daily or minute data for a few 10's of thousands items like stocks or other financial instruments, IoT sensors, etc).\r\n \\* Parquet Standard - Is the issue intrinsic to the Parquet standard you think? The ability to read a sub-set of the columns and or row-groups, compact storage through the use of RLE, categoricals etc, all seem to point to the format being well suited for these use-cases?\r\n \\* Parquet-C++ implementation - Is the issue with current Parquet-C++ implementation, or any of the dependencies? Is it something which could be fixed? Would a specialized implementation help? Is the problem related to going from Parquet -> Arrow -> Python/Pandas? E.g. would a Parquet -> numpy reader work better?\r\n \\* Alternatives - What would you recommend as a superior solution? Store this data tall i.s.o wide? Use another storage format?\r\n\r\nAppreciate your (and others) insights.\r\n\r\nCheers, Maarten."
