Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a cache hit despite that it has been working for a long time. Perhaps some of the plugin's dependencies may have been updated since then because the generated cache keys are identical, so there should be a cache hit.\r\n\r\nCurrently installing the vcpkg packages take around ~50m which makes its maintenance really time consuming.",
