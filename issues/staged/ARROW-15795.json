        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15795](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15795). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTimeStampMicroTZVector is a vector containing a timezone.\r\n\r\nHowever when reading values from this vector there is no clean way to get this time zone.\r\n\r\nThe current way to get it is:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n((ArrowType.Timestamp) vector.getField().getFieldType().getType()).getTimezone()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the vector has the timezone as a private field: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/fa78edc8b08fa022e34db8b8fdeef4df41de703f/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/TimeStampMicroTZVector.java#L41\r\n\r\nso adding a getter is easy and would really simplify reading the values in this vector.
