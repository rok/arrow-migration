It still has column names and types.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExpected behavior of arrow::write_dataset\r\n\r\nI would expect that it would be possible to have a FileSystemDataset with zero rows that would contain metadata about the column names and types. arrow::write_dataset would create the FileSystemDataset metadata when given a dataframe with zero rows.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n\r\narrow::write_dataset() does nothing when passed a dataframe with zero rows.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nReproducible example using the current arrow package on CRAN\r\n```java\n\r\narrow::write_dataset(cars, here::here(\"cars\"))\r\narrow::open_dataset(here::here(\"cars\"))\r\n#> FileSystemDataset with 1 Parquet file\r\n#> speed: double\r\n#> dist: double\r\n#>\u00a0\r\n#> See $metadata for additional Schema metadata\r\nfile.exists(here::here(\"cars\"))\r\n#> [1] TRUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndf <- cars[cars$speed > 1000, ]\r\nnrow(df)\r\n#> [1] 0\r\narrow::write_dataset(df, here::here(\"df\"), format = \"feather\")\r\narrow::open_dataset(here::here(\"df\"))\r\n#> Error: IOError: Cannot list directory '/private/var/folders/xx/01v98b6546ldnm1rg1_bvk000000gn/T/RtmpGkX0gK/reprex-17c305ed29ad5-nerdy-ram/df'.
