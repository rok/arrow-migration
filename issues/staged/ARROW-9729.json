Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAn incompatibility between Eclipse (m2e-apt), Error Prone prevents other annotation processors to work correctly within Eclipse, which is especially an issue with Immutables.org annotation processor as it generated classes needed for the project to compile.\r\n\r\nThis is explained in more detailed in this bug report for m2e-apt Eclipse plugin: https://github.com/jbosstools/m2e-apt/issues/62\r\n\r\nThere's no easy workaround Eclipse user can apply by themselves, but the Arrow project could not include Error Prone as an annotation processor when being imported into Eclipse, in order for the other annotation processors to work.",
