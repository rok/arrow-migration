Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor chunked array, variance kernel needs to merge variances.\r\nTested with two single value chunk, [40000008000000490], [40000008000000400]. The merged variance is 3872. If treated as single array with two values, the variance is 3904, same as numpy outputs.\r\nSo current merging method is not stable in extreme cases when chunks are very short and with approximate mean values.",
