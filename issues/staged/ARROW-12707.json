Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMany of the compute function options objects have a defaults() method in order to initialise the default options.\u00a0 However, SplitPatternOptions does not. Please can we have one added?",

I'm not sure how `filter` and `take` work exactly. But they are vector kernels as opposed to scalar kernels (e.g. SplitPatternTransform) so perhaps that is in play."
