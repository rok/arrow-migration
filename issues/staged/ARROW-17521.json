        "title": "[Python] Add python bindings for NamedTableProvider for Substrait consumer",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17521](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17521). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe C++ Substrait consumer currently supports a named table provider to handle the NamedTable relation:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nusing NamedTableProvider =\r\n    std::function<Result<compute::Declaration>(const std::vector<std::string>&)>;\r\nstatic NamedTableProvider kDefaultNamedTableProvider;\r\n\r\n/// Options that control the conversion between Substrait and Acero representations of a\r\n/// plan.\r\nstruct ConversionOptions {\r\n  /// \\brief How strictly the converter should adhere to the structure of the input.\r\n  ConversionStrictness strictness = ConversionStrictness::BEST_EFFORT;\r\n  /// \\brief A custom strategy to be used for providing named tables\r\n  ///\r\n  /// The default behavior will return an invalid status if the plan has any\r\n  /// named table relations.\r\n  NamedTableProvider named_table_provider = kDefaultNamedTableProvider;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very useful for testing and experimenting as it allows you to provide tables from memory (using a table_source node for example).  We should add pyarrow bindings.  I don't think they need to expose the full compute::DeclarationInfo range of table sources.  A simple approach might be a function that, given a list of names, returns either a table, an iterable of batches, or a record batch reader.",
