        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12734](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12734). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSnowpack builds break as of Apache Arrow v4.0.0, with the following error:\r\n\r\nReferenceError: Cannot access 'Buffer' before initialization\r\n at eval (eval at <anonymous> (<https://cdn.skypack.dev/-/apache-arrow@v4.0.0-R0opCrO48cH4DMah69zo/dist=es2020,mode=imports/optimized/apache-arrow.js:6:17>), <anonymous>:1:1)\r\n at <https://cdn.skypack.dev/-/apache-arrow@v4.0.0-R0opCrO48cH4DMah69zo/dist=es2020,mode=imports/optimized/apache-arrow.js:6:17>\r\n\r\nI believe this also breaks other bundlers that use hot module replacement, such as Vite (<https://github.com/vitejs/vite).>\r\n\r\nThis appears to be caused by the following line of exported code, which makes potentially problematic use of \"eval\":\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n`const _Buffer = eval(\"typeof Buffer === 'function' ? Buffer : null\");`\r\n\r\nNote that Arrow version 3 works without incident. This error was reported by a user of the Arquero library (<https://github.com/uwdata/arquero/issues/166)>\u00a0as it is breaking their build.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, load the following HTML:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n `<!DOCTYPE html>`\r\n `<html lang=\"en\">`\r\n `\u00a0 <body>`\r\n `\u00a0 \u00a0 <script type=\"module\">`\r\n `\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 import * as Arrow from \"https://cdn.skypack.dev/apache-arrow@4.0.0\";`\r\n `\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(Arrow);`\r\n `\u00a0 \u00a0 </script>`\r\n `\u00a0 </body>`\r\n `</html>`\r\n \u00a0",

If I update my HTML snippet above to use 5.0.0 instead of 4.0.0, I see the following error in the browser console:\r\n\r\nnode:string_decoder?from=apache-arrow:14 Uncaught Error: [Package Error] \"string_decoder\" does not exist. (Imported by \"apache-arrow\").\r\n at node:string_decoder?from=apache-arrow:14\r\n\r\nI haven't dug deeper, but the \"node:\" prefix above suggests that perhaps server-side imports may be improperly included in a browser bundle?"
