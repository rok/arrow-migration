Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExecutionContext already has a register_csv convenience method. It would be good to add one for parquet too. There is existing code in unit tests that show how to register a parquet file, but it should be something like this:\r\n```java\n\r\n// register parquet table\r\nlet table = ParquetTable::try_new(&filename)?;\r\nctx.register_table(\"property\", Rc::new(table));\n```",
