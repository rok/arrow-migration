        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16297](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16297). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs `[~npr]` mentioned in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12849#issuecomment-1101489333,> the current code in `nixlibs.R` doesn't handle components that have multiple words (because of the way it parses variable names from filenames). Until now, we've had a special case for the AWS variables, but `ARROW_GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_URL` and `ARROW_NLOHMANN_JSON_URL` also need handling. Instead of adding special cases, we can provide the correct `ARROW_*_URL` values with the new bash script added as part of ARROW-15092.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'll add a PR.",
