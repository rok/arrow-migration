Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the SerialBlockReader when `skip_rows_` is set and there are more rows to skip than what is in the current block `partial_` is set as an empty buffer when it should be the remainder of the current buffer. This could cause a problem if the buffer ends in the middle of a quoted value since that will throw off parsing.",
