Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer [this mailing list discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread/6crmd1qp093gk1s3l2sjdy88qoqym409), it is proposed that the following policies be adopted and documented relative to issue handling:\r\n \\* Issues should be assigned only when they are being actively worked, or expected to be worked in the immediate future. Assigned issues that have not been updated in past 90 days should be reverted to unassigned.\r\n \\* All issues \"In Progress\" required an assignee. Any unassigned issue in \"In Progress\" status should be reverted to \"Open\" status.\r\n \\* Expected usage of issue status and resolution fields should be documented.",
