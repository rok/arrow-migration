Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor example in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10340 we're explicitly removing support for IE. We should at least document that IE support is an explicit non-goal. Even better if we can identify supported version ranges for major browsers. ",
