        "title": "[Python] Trailing space character in RowGroup statistics of pyarrow.parquet.ParquetFile",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2503). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen reading a parquet file containing a string column, the _RowGroup_ statistics contain a trailing space character for the string column. The example below shows the behavior.\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\n# create and write arrow table as parquet\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'string_column': ['some', 'string', 'values', 'here']})\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\npq.write_table(table, 'example.parquet')\r\n\r\n# read parquet file metadata and print string column statistics\r\npq_file = pq.ParquetFile(open('example.parquet', 'rb'))\r\nprint(pq_file.metadata.row_group(0).column(0).statistics.max) # yields b'values '\r\nprint(pq_file.metadata.row_group(0).column(0).statistics.min) # yields b'here '\r\n```\r\nFor other data types I did not observe this problem, even though the statistics are always strings.\r\n\r\nWhen reading the same file with _fastparquet_, there is no trailing space character, which implies that this problem occurs in the reading path of _pyarrow.parquet_. I am aware that this might well be an issue with _parquet-cpp_, but as I face this bug as a _pyarrow_ user, I report it here.\r\n\r\nI'll try to investigate this further and report back here.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nThe trailing space is added in _parquet-cpp_. _pyarrow_ calls the function _FormatStatValue_ which adds the trailing space (https://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp/blob/master/src/parquet/types.cc#L52). There is no comment there to explain it. Does anyone here know what the reason is?",
