However, works on the older 8.0.0 release.\r\nI've included the same example given in ARROW-1888 to reproduce the error.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n`arr = pa.array([\\\\{'a': 1, 'b': None}, \\\\{'a': 2, 'b': None}])`\r\n`print(arr.type)`\r\n`arr.cast(pa.struct([('a', pa.int64()), ('b', pa.int64())]))`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\n`<pyarrow.lib.StructArray object at 0x7fb475f0e460> \u2013 is_valid: all not null \u2013 child 0 type: int64 [ 1, 2 ] \u2013 child 1 type: int64 [ null, null ]\u00a0`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n`ArrowNotImplementedError: Unsupported cast from struct<a: int64, b: null> to struct using function cast_struct`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

In both cases I get the same expected result you show for 8.0.0.\r\n\r\nCould you double check your pyarrow version and then provide more details on your environment (OS, how you installed pyarrow)?"
