Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/arrow-dev/201704.mbox/%3CCAJPUwMBV5pkiXqY1-hsfP%3D2qgjQg-hMKZMwmQa3jKdDfxSS26A%40mail.gmail.com%3E\n\n> since we have metadata for tensors/ndarrays and support in C++, having analogous metadata for sparse matrices seems reasonable. Someone else asked me about this in person recently (related to machine learning applications).\n\n> While many Arrow implementations will be focused on the in-memory columnar / record batch data model, having these traditional scientific computing memory layouts available for shared memory IPC will open up the Arrow C/C++ libraries to more use cases. We wouldn't necessarily expect other Arrow implementations (like Java) to implement these, though, unless they needed them.\n",
