Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently this is being statically linked. Since some toolchains may use the libprotobuf shared library in other places, we should add an option to allow packagers to utilize a common shared library at link time",
