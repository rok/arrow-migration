I don't think this is a blocker for 0.7.0, but it impacts static linkers (e.g. linkers of parquet-cpp)\n\nThis was introduced in ARROW-1339 https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/94b7cfafae0bda8f68ee3e5e9702c954b0116203\n\ncc `[~mdeepak]`",

We need `boost::filesystem` for handling unicode file paths on Windows. Trying to conditionally use boost::filesystem only on Windows would be a lot of work without a great deal of benefit.\n\nOne solution to this problem would be to add an option to vendor the requisite Boost bits in parquet-cpp, like we've done in Arrow \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L129\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake#L139"
