Here is our code for writing dictionary values encoded children in a map vector (FYI there is some non-relevant bits that involve our integration with geotools, and it's in scala):\n\nhttps://github.com/locationtech/geomesa/blob/master/geomesa-arrow/geomesa-arrow-gt/src/main/scala/org/locationtech/geomesa/arrow/vector/ArrowAttributeWriter.scala#L189-L191\nhttps://github.com/locationtech/geomesa/blob/master/geomesa-arrow/geomesa-arrow-gt/src/main/scala/org/locationtech/geomesa/arrow/vector/ArrowAttributeWriter.scala#L224-L225\n\nhttps://github.com/locationtech/geomesa/blob/master/geomesa-arrow/geomesa-arrow-gt/src/main/scala/org/locationtech/geomesa/arrow/vector/ArrowAttributeReader.scala#L148\nhttps://github.com/locationtech/geomesa/blob/master/geomesa-arrow/geomesa-arrow-gt/src/main/scala/org/locationtech/geomesa/arrow/vector/ArrowAttributeReader.scala#L164-L167"

This sets up the metadata correctly. The child vector is of the dictionary encoded type (e.g. Int), and you have to manually encode dictionary values before writing them. On read, you have to examine the schema so that you know to manually decode the Int values appropriately."
