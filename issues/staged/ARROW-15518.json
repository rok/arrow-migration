        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15518](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15518). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt might be helpful to implement array metadata validation in the GDB extension, similar to `Array::Validate` in the C++ API.\r\n\r\nOne downside is that the GDB Python API is rather slow, and validating arrays unconditionally when displaying them might make interaction even slower than it already is.\r\n",
