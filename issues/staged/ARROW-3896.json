        "title": "[MATLAB] Decouple MATLAB-Arrow conversion logic from Feather file specific logic",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3896). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the logic for converting between a MATLAB mxArray and various Arrow data structures (arrow::Table, arrow::Array, etc.) is tightly coupled and fairly tangled up with the logic specific to handling Feather files. It would be helpful to factor out these conversions into a more generic \"mlarrow\" conversion layer component so that it can be reused in the future for use cases other than Feather support. Furthermore, this would be helpful to enforce a cleaner separation of concerns.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to start off with this refactoring work up front before adding support for more datatypes to the MATLAB featherread/featherwrite functions, so that we can start off with a clean base upon which to expand moving forward.",
