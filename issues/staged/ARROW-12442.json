        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12442](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12442). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe default timeout for a single job in Github Actions is 6 hours:\r\n\r\n<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes>\r\n\r\nWhile our jobs normally do not exceed 1 hour of runtime (and most of them are far quicker), sometimes some network issues may lead a job to take up the full 6 hours before timing out. Not only does this contribute to our own build queue growing unnecessarily, but it also impedes other Apache projects, since the number of jobs which can be run in parallel is capped at the organization level.\r\n\r\nWe should therefore configure job timeouts which reflect our expectation of the overall runtime for each job. 1 hour should be a safe value for most of them, and would already dramatically reduce the impact of network issues.",
