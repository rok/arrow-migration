Alternatively, you may set the environment variables ARROW_CFLAGS and ARROW_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config. See the pkg-config man page for more details.`\r\nI could not find the following link.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/c_glib/README.md#common-build-problems>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
