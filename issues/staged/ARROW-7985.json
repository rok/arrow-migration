        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7985](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7985). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHere's a reproduction:\r\n```java\n\r\n#include <arrow/builder.h>\r\n#include <arrow/status.h>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n        arrow::ListBuilder lb(arrow::default_memory_pool(), std::unique_ptr<arrow::ArrayBuilder>(new arrow::Int32Builder()));\r\n        lb.value_builder()->Reserve(100); // bug\r\n        lb.Append();\r\n        std::shared_ptr<arrow::Array> ar;\r\n        arrow::Status st = lb.Finish(&ar);\r\n        if (!st.ok()) {\r\n                std::cerr << st << '\\n';\r\n                return 1;\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe output is\r\n```\n\r\nInvalid: Resize cannot downsize\n```\r\nThe Resize call is made at builder_nested.h, line 115. There's a note there about ARROW-2744. Perhaps the fix is to look at capacity rather than length?",
