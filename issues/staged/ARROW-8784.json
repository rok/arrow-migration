        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8784](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8784). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe reason that the LogicalPlan currently uses Arc rather than Box is to support the ability to pass the logical plan between threads.\r\n\r\nI am no longer sure that this is a requirement, and if it is, then it would perhaps be better to serialize the plan to JSON using the serde crate.",
