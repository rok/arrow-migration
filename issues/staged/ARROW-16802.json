        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16802](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16802). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom `[~amol-]` :\r\n> If we want to start promoting Acero to the world, I think we should work on improving a bit the documentation first. Having a blog post that then redirects people to a docs that they find hard to read/apply might actually be counterproductive as it might create a fame of being badly documented.\n> At the moment the only mention of it is\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/streaming_execution.html>\u00a0and it's not very easy to follow (not much explainations, just blocks of code). In comparison if you look at the compute chapter in Python (\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/python/compute.html>\u00a0) it's much more talkative and explains things as it goes.",

Thanks in advance!"

You can sign up at: <https://arrow.apache.org/community/> We don't have any Acero-specific channels, but maybe that will one day change."

We will discourage direct use of the ExecPlan API and encourage developers to use Substrait plans to tell Acero what operations to execute. So we should probably not invest too much energy in documenting the ExecPlan API."
