Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n  I have been tracking down issues in our use of DataFusion for my work project, and I have found myself wanting to print out the state of the logical_plan several times. The existing debug formatting is ok, but it is missing a few key items:\r\n\r\n1. schema information (as in when did columns appear / disappear in the plan)\n1. A visual representation (graphviz)\n",
