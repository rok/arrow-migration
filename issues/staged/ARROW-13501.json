Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNot sure about the API on this because from what I understand from `[~bkietz]`, every aggregation function takes a single field ref, but group_by then count doesn't require a field because you're counting how many rows are in each group. (Perhaps more importantly, dplyr::n() takes no arguments, so we don't have a field ref in our expression to start.)",
