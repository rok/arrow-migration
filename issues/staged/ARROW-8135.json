        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8135](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8135). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi, when I am trying to import pyarrow in python, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n**File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>**\r\n **File \"/services/matejm/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyarrow/__init__.py\", line 49, in <module>**\r\n **from pyarrow.lib import cpu_count, set_cpu_count**\r\n **ImportError: libaws-cpp-sdk-s3.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory**\r\n What can this be related to? I have searched wherever i could've and could not find any reason for it, so I figured i might as well try in here.\r\n\r\nThank you very much\r\n\r\nNote: I have installed py-arrow and its dependencies off-line, since our cluster has a company firewall that does not allow pip nor conda installation",
