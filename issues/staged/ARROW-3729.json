I don't seem to be able to claim it myself. Thanks.\r\n\r\nThe enhancement I'm contemplating (and have largely completed) involves\u00a0switching over to using\u00a0(that is, generating on write, recognizing on read) the new parquet.thrift\u00a0LogicalType (aka \"annotation\") metadata recently introduced into parquet-cpp (see PARQUET-1411).\u00a0 Thus the patch will be broader than just adding nanosecond units to timestamps, but will include that.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
