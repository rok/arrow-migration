Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHere is example output from a failed invocation\u00a0 of `archery lint --cmake-format`:\r\n\u00a0\r\nINFO:archery:Running cmake-format linters\r\nERROR __main__.py:618: Check failed: /arrow/cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake\r\n\u00a0\r\nIt would be helpful to get the error details on failure, e.g., as a diff output like for C++. Granted, this may be low priority since `archery lint --cmake-format --fix` fixes the errors.",
