That was probably a missing dependency definition \"skins\" in java/performance/pom.xml artifact arrow-performance, which could have been loaded from Maven Central and inserted. The mentioned link (<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/skins/maven-default-skin/1.0/>) was already correct, but the dependency was not listed in the dependencies of the artifact and not automatically downloaded. Now, this dependency seems to get solved automatically. Probably due to a newer Maven version.\r\n\r\nBut there is a new reason for failure now:\r\n\r\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n r-base : Depends: r-recommended (= 4.0.5-1.2010.0) but 4.1.0\r\n \u00a0\r\n This is the same error I can reproduce on my machine. Under Ubuntu 20.10 I could resolve the problem by removing the version number of r-base in ./ci/docker/linux-apt-docs.dockerfile:\r\n\r\nchanged line 54 from:\r\n r-base=${r}\\* \\\r\n\r\nto:\r\n r-base \\\r\n \u00a0\r\n No clue, whether this is the right place for the fix, that's why I didn't make a pull request. I am new here."
