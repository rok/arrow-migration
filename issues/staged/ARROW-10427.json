Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- Add a client middleware which receives and re-uses a session token from the server.\n   \\* Add a server middleware which, when encountering a request with no session header, creates a session on the backend, generates a token for it, and sends the token to the client in a header. The client can re-use this as indicated above.\n   \\* If the client has a session header, re-use the same session from the backend (report an error if an invalid session was used).",

I also wonder if there's libraries we can take advantage of for this, like itsdangerous in Python. (We may want to consider a flight-contrib module at that point, though.)"
