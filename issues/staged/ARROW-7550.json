        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7550](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7550). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe wrap the examples in `\\donttest{`} so that they aren't run on CRAN, where the Arrow C++ library isn't present and thus the examples would error. But locally and on our CI, where we **are** testing with the C++ library, we should run the examples to ensure that they're valid. (As ARROW-7543 revealed, they weren't.)",
