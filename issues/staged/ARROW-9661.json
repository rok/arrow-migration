        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9661](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9661). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have some bytes, which are in IPC streaming format, but Java failed to read data and give me back error\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\njava.io.IOException: Expected schema but header was 0\r\n```\r\nHere is my java code\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nBufferAllocator allocator = new RootAllocator(Long.MAX_VALUE);\r\nArrayList<ValueVector> valueVectors = new ArrayList<>();\r\nfinal ArrayList<List<ValueVector>> batchOfVectors = new ArrayList<>();\r\nfinal RootAllocator rootAllocator = new RootAllocator();\r\nInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"/tmp/arrowdata\");\r\ntry (ArrowStreamReader reader = new ArrowStreamReader(inputStream, allocator); ) {\r\n  VectorSchemaRoot root = reader.getVectorSchemaRoot();  // <- IOException thrown in the line\r\n \u00a0while (reader.loadNextBatch()) {\r\n \u00a0  valueVectors = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 for (FieldVector f : root.getFieldVectors())\r\n    { \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n      // transfer will not copy data but transfer ownership of memory \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n      // from streamReader to resultChunk \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n      TransferPair t = f.getTransferPair(rootAllocator); \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n      t.transfer(); \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n      valueVectors.add(t.getTo()); \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n    }\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 batchOfVectors.add(valueVectors);\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0root.clear();\r\n \u00a0}\r\n}\n```\r\nI am using arrow-vector 1.0.0 and I put my arrow data in the attachment. I am pretty sure data is correct since I can read data using JS sdk.\r\n\r\nI am willing to provide more information if you want. And I appreciate if anyone can give me some guide on how to debug this ( Not sure if this is a netty thing since I do have another version of netty as dependency in my project )",
