Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMy main incentive here is that I want to have a Python sdist that can be installed with a simple `pip install ./dist/pyarrow.tar.gz` (so we could provide source distributions on PyPI). This will still let the install of pyarrow depend on CMake but at least we would have the ability of a source distribution.",
