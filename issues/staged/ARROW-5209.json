Some performance benchmarks must be setup first.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn this issue, we want to provide some performance benchmarks\u00a0extracted from our SQL engine, which\u00a0is going to be made open source soon. The workloads are obtained by running an open SQL benchmarks TPC-H.\u00a0",

The benchmark is extracted from running a query in TPC-H. The evaluation output looks like this:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nStatistics for benchmark TPC-H Q1#Project & Filter:\r\nNum of repeats = 10\r\nMax duration = 0.64111ms\r\nMin duration = 0.381478ms\r\nAvg duration = 0.48580240000000013ms\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is OK, I will provide more benchmarks concerning more TPC-H queries.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
