        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11300](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11300). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, hash aggregates are performing well when having a small number of output groups, but the results on db-benchmark <https://github.com/h2oai/db-benchmark/pull/182>\u00a0test on data with a high number of output groups.\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9234>\u00a0improved the situation a bit, but DataFusion is still much slower than even the slowest result when comparing to the published results.\r\n\r\nThis seems mostly having to do with the way we use individual key/groups.\r\nFor each new key, we _take_ the indices of the group, resulting in lots of small allocations and cache unfriendliness and other overhead if we have many keys with only a small (just 1-2) number of rows per group in a batch. Also the indices are converted from a Vec to an Array, making the situation worse (accounts for ~22% of the instructions on the master branch!), other profiling results seem to be from related allocations too.\r\n\r\nTo make it efficient for tiny groups, we should probably change the hash aggregate algorithm to\u00a0_take_\u00a0based on _all_ indices from the batch in one go, and \"slice\" into the resulting array for the individual accumulators.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHere is some profiling info of the db-benchmark questions 1-5 against master:\r\n\r\n![image-2021-01-18-13-00-36-685.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13018949/image-2021-01-18-13-00-36-685.png)",
