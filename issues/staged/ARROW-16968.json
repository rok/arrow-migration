Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, Python-UDFs are supported in Arrow at a low-level of abstraction. This issue is about expanding this support to Arrow Substrait, which is at a higher-level. This is intended for the Py/Arrow support of the use case in which a Substrait plan with Python UDFs is manually expressed using Ibis, automatically represented using Substrait, and automatically executed using Py/Arrow.",
