Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently how the CSV reader handles the first block in the CSV is not great.\r\n\r\nIn fact I think the first block is read multiple times. First in the Peek in file_csv.cc and then in the InitFromBlock in the OpenReaderAsync in reader.cc\r\n\r\nThis could be problematic if the first block is pretty big, and also delays the synchronous opening of a dataset.\r\n\r\nPossible solution is to use a smaller block size for the peek in file_csv.cc since you don't need to read the entire block to GetConvertOptions. So we could really just have another option in reader_options that's first_peek_size or something like that.\u00a0",
