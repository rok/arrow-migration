        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8182](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8182). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe packaging artifacts are tagged with the following version numer \"{latest-tag}.dev{distance}\" e.g. 0.16.0.dev1, 0.16.0.dev2, ...\r\n\r\nOnce we make nightly artifacts available for development purposes depending on the package manager 0.16.0 can be considered newer than 0.16.0.dev1. \r\n\r\nFor example to install a nightly wheel via pip the user must pin the exact version of the produced wheel, there are no options to prefer 0.16.0.devN over 0.16.0.\r\n\r\nOne way to resolve this to increment the version number's minor component, so instead of generating 0.16.0.devN version number after the 0.16 tag, create 0.16.1.devN version which will be considered newer than 0.16.0.",
