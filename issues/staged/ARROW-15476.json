Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are 3 links in the \"developing\" vignettes which point to absolute paths to articles for developers.  This works for the package vignettes but doesn't work well on pkgdown versions of the vignettes as they point to the latest published version of those articles, and so, for example, in the dev docs, result in \"Not Found\" as those docs are not yet published on the main site.",
