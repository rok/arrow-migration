Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is currently no simple way to result query results to CSV. It would be good to have convenience methods either in ExecutionContext or separate utility methods to enable results to be written in CSV format to stdout or to a file.\r\n\r\nThere is sample code in unit tests for this and the approach is to iterate over each\u00a0row in a batch and then iterate over each column and downcast it to an appropriate type (based on the schema associated with the batch) and then pull out the value for the row.\r\n\r\nSee\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/rust/datafusion/tests/sql.rs#L425-L497>\u00a0for example code in a test\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
