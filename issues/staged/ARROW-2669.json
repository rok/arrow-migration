Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI found when building with `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0'` (using a conda-forge-based C++ toolchain) that the benchmark executables are broken. This is caused by failing to pass the `EP_CXX_FLAGS` CMake variable when building gbenchmark",
