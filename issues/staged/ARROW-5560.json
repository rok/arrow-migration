        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5560](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5560). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf the client tries to call `CreateObject` and there is not enough memory left in the object store to create it, an `OutOfMemory` error will be returned. However, the plasma store also creates an entry for the object, even though it failed to be created. This means that later on, if the client tries to create the object again, it will receive an error that the object already exists. Also, if the client tries to get the object, it will hang because the entry appears to be unsealed.\r\n\r\nWe should fix this by only creating the object entry if the `CreateObject` operation succeeds.",
