Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe maintenance cost of artifacts patters for crossbow tasks might not worth the effort.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- it provides an extra layer of security for the artifact naming to conform\n- we can ensure to have the expected set of artifacts\n  \n  Cons:\n- we often forget to update them, so the arfitacts don't get downloaded during release process\n- the uploaded file paths are not checked neither by crossbow.py status nor the ursabot comment bot\n  \n  cc `[~kou]`",
