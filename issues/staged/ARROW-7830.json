Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~jeroenooms]` pointed this out to me. \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n$ pkg-config --modversion arrow\r\n0.16.0\r\n$ pkg-config --modversion arrow-dataset\r\n0.16.0\r\n$ pkg-config --modversion parquet\r\n1.5.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get that parquet-cpp is technically not part of Apache Arrow, but if we're releasing a libparquet with libarrow at our release time, wouldn't it make sense to at least bump the parquet version at the same time, even if the version numbers aren't the same?",

Vetinari (h-vetinari):*\nWhat does the parquet-version used here (1.5.1) stand for, actually? Upstream parquet [never had](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/releases?after=parquet-1.6.0rc1) a 1.5.1 release, and if it had, it would be 5-6 years old.\r\n\r\nI mean, I get that it's set [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/src/parquet), but the relation to arrow and/or parquet versions (or what 1.0.0 meant for that number, for that matter) is not apparent to me."

Vetinari (h-vetinari):*\nOK, I didn't want to come off as demanding (anything, really), just trying to understand the situation.\r\n\r\nI had only ever seen PARQUET-xxxx associated with parquet-mr, I had never stumbled on the [parquet-cpp repo](https://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the head of that repo's README starts off as:\r\n> **Note: Development for Apache Parquet in C++ has moved**\r\n> \r\n> The Apache Arrow and Parquet have merged development process and build systems in the Arrow repository. Please submit pull requests in https://github.com/apache/arrow.\r\n\r\nSo wouldn't it be a reasonable way of looking at things that the arrow-project can now set the corresponding version number (or absorb the project completely, for example)?"
