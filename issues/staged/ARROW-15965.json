Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[RoundToMultipleOptions](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/api_scalar.h#L126) contains a constructor with a `shared_ptr<Scalar>` type but the [Python binding](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/includes/libarrow.pxd#L1959) is missing this constructor variant. This currently prevents using `Decimal` types in pyarrow.",
