Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe reuse the yml anchor to define the command for the conda docker builds: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L240\r\n\r\nThe `true` argument instruments the script to build the documentation. We should only enable it in the conda-cpp build which is exercised on all commits and disable for the rest of the builds.",
