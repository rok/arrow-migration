Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWould it be possible to adding support for these functions with types other than decimal128?\r\n\r\n \\* abs with int64, float64\r\n \\* ceil with float64\r\n \\* floor with float64\r\n \\* round with float64\r\n\r\nAdditionally, could sqrt [with int64 & float64] be implemented? This one is easy to work around, but would be convenient.",
