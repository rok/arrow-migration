        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3540](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3540). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have a specific implementation for `BooleanArray` (bit-packing), but due to the `ArrowPrimitiveType` trait which we use as a trait bound in many places `PrimitiveArray<bool>` is still a valid type.\u00a0 `make_array` actually uses `PrimitiveArray<bool>` which may be a bug but would be fixed by this issue anyway.\r\n\r\nI propose move the implementation of `BooleanArray` into `PrimitiveArray<bool>`, this would allow us to use the `ArrayPrimitiveType` trait as a bound more consistently.\u00a0 i.e. `PrimitiveArrayBuilder<T>` could return `PrimitiveArray<T>` instead of having a separate `BooleanArrayBuilder`.",
