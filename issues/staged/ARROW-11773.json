        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11773](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11773). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\r\nCurrently the arrow json writer makes JSON that looks like this (one record per line):\r\n```\r\n{\"foo\":1}\r\n{\"bar\":1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas a JSON array looks like this\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\"foo\":1},\r\n  {\"bar\":1}\r\n]\r\n```\r\nIt would be nice to write out json in a streaming fashion (we added such a feature in IOx via https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/pull/870/files)\r\n\r\n/// Writes out well formed JSON arays in a streaming fashion\r\n///\r\n/// [{\"foo\": \"bar\"}, {\"foo\": \"baz\"}]\r\n///\r\n/// This is based on the arrow JSON writer (json::writer::Writer)\r\n",
