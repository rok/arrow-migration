Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently most consuming sink node implementations require the schema so they can convert from ExecBatch to RecordBatch.  However, the node already knows the schema of the batches (it is the output schema of the input).  By passing this schema to the consumers we can avoid having to know the schema ahead of time and simplify creating a sink node consumer.",
