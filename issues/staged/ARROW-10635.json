        "title": "[C++] ORC reader issue with bool column",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10635). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe ORC file contains single column of boolean type, from row number `20000` the values are mismatching compared to what is expected.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs per my observation, the writer used for this ORC file\u00a0assumes RLE is aligned with row index boundaries. That means, no two row groups will share same byte. And there will be no offset within byte. But I think that pyarrow considers whatever leftover of that partial byte which was left at end of a row group as data which causes the shift in the values.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have attached another parquet file with same data for reference. You would notice that ORC considers last two bits of partial byte and shifts the data by two rows.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n// code placeholder\r\nfrom pyarrow import orc\r\nf = orc.ORCFile('broken_bool.orc')\r\npdf_orc=f.read().to_pandas() \r\npdf_pq=pd.read_parquet(\"bool_pq.parquet\")\u00a0 \r\npdf_orc.col_bool.dropna()[pdf_orc.col_bool.dropna() != pdf_pq.col_bool.dropna()] \r\n\r\n20002 False \r\n20004 False \r\n20005 True \r\n20007 False \r\n20014 True \r\n... \r\n21973 False \r\n21974 False \r\n21985 True \r\n21988 True \r\n21993 False\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

I will use the official ORC C++ library to read it to verify my hypothesis. If it is the ORC C++ library that is not reading the file correctly then either we need to file an issue there or the file does not satisfy the ORC format specification."
