Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe can do this after the dust settles with the in-flight patches, but it would be good to have `pyarrow._array` instead of `pyarrow.array`. If we need to expose a module \"publicly\" to the user, it would be better to do it in pure Python (as we've done already with `pyarrow._parquet`).",
