        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12558](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12558). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt looks like we conditionally use RE2 (only on RTOOLS 4.0), do we need to do this or can RTOOLS 3.5 compile RE2? https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/configure.win#L59\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-backports/pull/42#issuecomment-827185255\r\n\r\nOK I deployed this, but note that now you need to fix your R package, because you built w/ libre2, but currently in your R package you only link to with -lre2 for rtools40, but not for the backport:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/configure.win#L59\r\n\r\nSo you need to change that to link to -lre2 unconditionally.\r\n\r\nBefore you submit to cran make sure to test on winbuilder, in particular the R-oldrelease flavour, which uses this backport.\r\n",
