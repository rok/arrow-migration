Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe wheel build task in `dev/tasks/python-wheels/github.osx.arm64.yml` uses a hodgepodge of random `arch` calls that currently work but do not have a rational justification.\r\n\r\nSomeone should take a deep look at these and rationalize them: normally, it should be enough to create each Python environment with the right architecture.\r\n\r\nAlso, do note that the self-hosted M1 runner actually runs in x86 mode by default, so it's necessary to issue `arch -arm64` to select ARM64 mode.",
