        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9991](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9991). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimilar to Python str.split and bytes.split, we'd like to have a way to convert str into list[str] (and similarly for bytes).\r\n\r\nWhen the separator is given, the algorithms for both types are the same. Python, however, overloads strip. When given no separator, the algorithm will split considering all whitespace (unicode for str, ascii for bytes)\u00a0as separator.\r\n\r\nI'd rather see not too much overloaded kernels, e.g.\r\n\r\nbinary_split (takes string/binary separator, and maxsplit arg, no special utf8 version needed)\r\n\r\nutf8_split_whitespace (similar to Python's version given no separator)\r\n\r\nascii_split_whitespace (similar to Python's version given no separator, but considering ascii, although this could work on any binary data)\r\n\r\nthere can also be rsplit versions of these, or they could be an argument.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
