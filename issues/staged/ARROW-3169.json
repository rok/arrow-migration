Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo improve readability I suggest splitting array-test.cc into multiple compilation units (which will still be linked into an executable `array-test`). We can do the same thing with array.h/array.cc, while maintaining the `arrow/array.h` public header. Some of these could go into `arrow/columnar` or `arrow/impl`, or something similar. ",
