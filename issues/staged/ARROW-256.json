I would assume that we would add this as the first field in the Message type in\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Message.fbs#L174\n\nAs an aside, for Flatbuffers as a metadata representation in particular, we will obviously have to take care that a v2 message can be received by a v1 consumer (where the internals of the Message differ significantly). My understanding from reading the docs is that as long as the version is at the head of the Message table then the vtable indirection (https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_white_paper.html) makes this safe."
