Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe need tests that ensure that we are supporting all types that should be supported for the various compute kernels.  For example, arithmetic kernels should support any combination of numeric inputs.  I've created a first pass at this (and filed a number of JIRAs for places we are missing support).  This PR is to get the test itself upstreamed into Arrow.",
