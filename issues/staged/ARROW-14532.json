Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm tried to multiply 2 Decimal128 arrays with max precision(38) and it fails because precision is out of range. I expected that result should be converted to Decimal256 in such case, what do you think?\r\n```java\n\r\na = Arrow::Decimal128ArrayBuilder.build(\r\n  Arrow::Decimal128DataType.new(38, 15), [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]\r\n)\r\n\r\nb = Arrow::Decimal128ArrayBuilder.build(\r\n  Arrow::Decimal128DataType.new(38, 15), [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]\r\n)\r\n\r\nArrow::Function.find('multiply').execute([a, b])\r\nArrow::Error::Invalid: [function][execute]: Invalid: Decimal precision out of range: 77\r\n\r\nArrow::Function.find('add').execute([a, b])\r\nArrow::Error::Invalid: [function][execute]: Invalid: Decimal precision out of range: 39\n```",

See ARROW-14110 which also links an ML discussion.\r\n\r\nWe could add options to choose between erroring/rescaling/promoting. That said I think promoting the type is at least a reasonable default."
