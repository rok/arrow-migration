One thing we're missing in C++ is incrementally building up the schema.\n\nFor example we have the use case that we already know 20 columns that shall be written into the Parquet file. We can serialise these columns and free the memory associated with them. But several other columns (of same length of course) will be generated later in a pipeline but that first part of the pipeline is unaware how many and of which type. Currently we build a Pandas DataFrame until we have reached the end of the pipeline. Subsequent jobs also only read a subset of columns (but different combinations thereof). Directly writing out these columns are they are computed would help us save a lot of RAM. Related issue for that: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-749"
