Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is because of:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/metadata.cc#L321\n\nSince the buffer structure of record batches contains only indices, this should be the buffer layout in the IPC metadata.\n\nWe should double check that Java is doing the right thing (I believe it is)\n\ncc [~paul.e.taylor] `[~lmeyerov]`",
