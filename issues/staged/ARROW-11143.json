        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11143). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently MemoryPool::Free has void return: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/e05f032c1e5d590ac56372d13ec637bd28b47a96/cpp/src/arrow/memory_pool.h#L88.\r\n\r\nThis is not enough for some complicated scenarios like in ARROW-7808, we bring some possible JNI calls in the method within class ReservationListenableMemoryPool: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7030/files#diff-ad18b6c937b5960c70ef6825654a98de6ee33ae72127a4af4895afe944966144R582-R604.\r\n\r\nWe can discuss more on this before actually solving this issue in case we think of `Free` is always a error-free behavior comparing to `Allocate`. Anyway if the logic of cod e grows there will always be complicated codes that can throw errors to be brought. Anyway we can expect some more comments to this topic from dev.",

Especially as it will be called implicitly from destructors, which have no way of returning an error. I suggest you architecture your code so as to avoid this issue."

If you need to be able to capture failure information, you probably want to do that via your implementation (or wrapper thereof) of MemoryPool, then add appropriate checks of the captured error information around the known deallocation points where you believe errors are possible.
