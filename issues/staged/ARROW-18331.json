Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt does seem we have not updated conan recipes since 8.0.1: https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes/arrow\r\nThat's why the latest version of arrow appears to be 8.0.1 here: \u00a0https://conan.io/center/arrow\r\n\r\nIs this something that we should do as part of post-release tasks? Should we add 9.0.0 and 10.0.0?",

And all of them are included in 10.0.0. (See also: ARROW-16089)\r\nSo we can do this now. :-)\r\n\r\nWe create a post release script for Conan into `dev/release/` and run it to open a pull request to update the arrow Conan recipe like we did for MSYS2/Homebrew/vcpkg."
