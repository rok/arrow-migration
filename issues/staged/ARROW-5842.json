        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5842](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5842). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `lastSet` member in ListVector seems misleading. According to the name, it should refers to the last index that is actually set. However, from the context of the code, it actually means the next index that will be set.\r\n\r\nWe fix this problem, and make it consistent with the `lastSet` in `BaseVariableWidthVector`.",

Thanks for your reminder.\r\n\r\nSince the methods are declared public. This issue only revises the internal semantics, leaving the external semantics unchanged, only making the methods deprecated. \r\n\r\nChanging the external semantics will be a long process."
