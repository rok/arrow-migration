Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6350.\r\n\r\nPython's setup.py defaults to the \"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64\" CMake generator here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-0.16.0/python/setup.py#L130\r\n\r\nWe found in ARROW-6757 that if VS 2017 or newer was used to build the C++ libraries, then there can be a toolchain conflict causing segfaults. I'm not sure if there's a better way to infer which VS toolchain is \"preferred\" (based on what \"VsDevCmd.bat\" was run), but we should see if we should do something other than what we have now",
