Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should probably make compute function naming more consistent while it's not too late.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- \"isin\", \"minmax\" but \"less_equal\", \"or_kleene\", \"binary_contains_exact\"\n- \"binary_contains_exact\" only works on string types\n- \"ascii_length\" accepts non-ascii input and simply counts the number of bytes\n- \"partition_to_indices\" vs. \"NthToIndices\"",
