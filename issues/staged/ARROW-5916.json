Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n0.13 ignored RecordBatch.length. \u00a00.14 requires that RecordBatch.length and array length be equal. \u00a0As per <https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/2692dd8fe09c92aa313bded2f4c2d4240b9ef75a8604ec214eb02571@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E>\u00a0, we discussed changing this so that RecordBatch.length can be [0,array length].\r\n\r\n\u00a0If RecordBatch.length is less than array length, the reader should ignore the portion of the array(s) beyond RecordBatch.length. \u00a0This will allow partially populated batches to be read in scenarios identified in the above discussion.\r\n\r\n```c++\n\r\n  Status GetFieldMetadata(int field_index, ArrayData* out) {\r\n    auto nodes = metadata_->nodes();\r\n    // pop off a field\r\n    if (field_index >= static_cast<int>(nodes->size())) {\r\n      return Status::Invalid(\"Ran out of field metadata, likely malformed\");\r\n    }\r\n    const flatbuf::FieldNode* node = nodes->Get(field_index);\r\n\r\n*    //out->length = node->length();*\r\n*    out->length = metadata_->length();*\r\n    out->null_count = node->null_count();\r\n    out->offset = 0;\r\n    return Status::OK();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttached is a test IPC File containing a batch with length 1, array length 3.",

The appropriate fix is probably here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/reader.cc#L368\r\n\r\nIf the arrays come back from `LoadArray` longer than `num_rows`, then the record batch should be constructed then sliced.
