Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is useful for doing things like...\r\n\r\nFuture<ItemVector> vec_fut = GetVectorOfThingsAsync();\r\n\r\nFuture<AsyncGenerator<Item>> gen_fut = vec_fut.Then([] (const SomeVector& vec) \\{ return MakeVectorGenerator(vec); };\r\n\r\nAsyncGenerator<Item> item_gen = MakeFutureFirstGenerator(gen_fut);\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe cost of the initial future is just part of the cost of getting the first item from the generator.",
