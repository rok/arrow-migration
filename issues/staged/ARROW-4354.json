One of the contributors on this project, Antoine Pitrou (didn't `at` him but he has commented on the ARROW-4313), has contributed to [Airspeed Velocity (ASV)](https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv)\u00a0which I have been looking at too, and which informed his initial comments on [the mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/278e573445c83bbd8ee66474b9356c5291a16f6b6eca11dbbe4b473a@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E). Here are a benchmarks for a [bunch of pandas-related projects](https://pandas.pydata.org/speed/) using Airspeed Velocity.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can take the best of both worlds, and use the database schema from Codespeed and the mostly static components of ASV. I am very impressed with the functionality of Airspeed Velocity."

I agree the backend is nice and simple is a good thing."

The only problem with L/GPL projects comes when you have a runtime dependency where you use Arrow _at all_ without it. "

We are using it the same way we are using Linux. The changes to the sources should be published if we want the modified Codespeed to be used elsewhere. Otherwise, we are good."

Anyway we can think about that later.\r\n\r\nOnce we have decided on a data model and spun up the database, it may be nice to enable interaction with the database via HTTP, I am interested in exploring\u00a0[postgrapgile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/) for an API; it literally parses the Postgres public schema and presents it as a GraphQL interface with no additional work, and has an existing build ready for [AWS lambda](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile-lambda-example). Then, all the data manipulation could be directly in the database. There is a `--cors` command-line option to enable use on a static site if we go that route. Codespeed also provides (I think) a JSON REST API so, again, the only question is whether we care to have a separate repo for a dynamic webpage."
