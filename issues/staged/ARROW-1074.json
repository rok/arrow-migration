        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1074](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1074). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[Feel free to change issue type because this is probably by design]\n\nI have noticed that that if the one of the columns in the parquet file is of type array, pyarrow table stores it as list\n>>> table[3].type\nDataType(list<element: string>)\nIf I do a .to_pandas() on the column, I get something like this\n>> table[3].to_pandas()\n0         None                                                                                                     \n1          [7]                                                                                                     \n2         [46]  \ndtype: object\n\nHowever, I cant do a pyarrow.Table.from_pandas from a dataframe having the above ndarray as a series/column. I get this error\nInvalid: Python object of type ndarray is not None and is not a string, bool, float, int, date,\ndecimal object\n\nIf to_pandas() can covert a list to ndarray, shouldnt from_pandas also convert an ndarray to type list in the table ?",

Do you have time to work on a patch for this?"
