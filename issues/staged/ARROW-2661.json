        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2661](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2661). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in order to pass HDFS configurations of values down to the underlying libhdfs driver you have to either set HADOOP_HOME (using libhdfs) or LIBHDFS3_CONF (for libhdfs3) to point to a location of an hdfs-site.xml file to use. However the API provided by them allows for calling hdfsBuilderConfSetStr to set arbitrary configuration values on the hdfsBuilder object. This would allow for consumers to programmatically set any arbitrary configurations they want including allowing for encryption and other complex hdfs configurations without needing to provide an hdfs-site.xml file.\r\n\r\n",
