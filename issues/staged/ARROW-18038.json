        "title": "[Archery][CI] Refactor git dependencies used on archery to be more consistent",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18038](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18038). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently archery has the following git related dependencies:\r\n```java\n\r\n  \u00a0 'release': ['gitpython']\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 'crossbow': ['github3.py', 'pygit2>=1.6.0']\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 'crossbow-upload': ['github3.py']\r\n    'bot': ['github3.py', 'pygit2>=1.6.0', 'pygithub']\n```\r\nthat makes difficult to work with archery git related code and makes more difficult code reuse. As an example the comment on this PR: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14033#discussion_r993778812>\r\n```java\n\r\nWhile dev/archery/archery/crossbow/core.py uses pygit2, dev/archery/archery/release/core.py uses GitPython. The Repo class that is used in each module are also not shared. \n```\r\nWe should refactor archery to not require 2 different github libraries (github3 and pygithub) and 2 different git ones (pygit and gitpython).",
