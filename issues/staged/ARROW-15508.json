        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15508](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15508). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe emit warnings in a few places where either we don't want to raise an error, or we simply cannot do so (for example in a destructor, or a void-returning handler to a foreign library). Currently, warnings are printed out in an inflexible log format specific to Arrow C++. It would be much better to make the emission of warnings configurable (for example, PyArrow would probably like to redirect them to the Python warnings machinery).",
