Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`TransferPair` related param checks in different classes have potential problems:\r\n\r\ni. `copyValueSafe`\u00a0do not check from index, if from > valueCount, no error is shown.\r\n\r\nii. `splitAndTansfer`\u00a0has no indices check in classes like `VarcharVector`\r\n\r\niii. `splitAndTranser`\u00a0indices check in classes like UnionVector is not correct\u00a0(Preconditions.checkArgument(startIndex + length <= valueCount)), should check params separately.\r\n\r\niv. some assert usages should be replaced with `Preconditions`.\r\n\r\nv. should add more UT to cover corner cases.",
