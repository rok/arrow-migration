Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis should implement the comparison operators  `>=, >, ==, !=, <, <=` between `arrow::compute::Datum` and `arrow::compute::Scalar`. \r\n\r\nThe result of this kernel will be a boolean type `arrow::compute::Datum` where with True/False set according to the outcome of the operation and NA if a row was not valid.\r\n\r\nA pre-condition to implement this kernel is to have a working implementation of `arrow::compute::Scalar`.",
