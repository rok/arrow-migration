If there are no objections I will create a PR (it is literally just changing the version number in the pom - no code changes required).",

We should move that functionality out of the vector module to a place where people can use it only if they need to (if we even need that functionality). Several core classes are labeled with Jackson but they shouldn't need to be (Field, Schema, DictionaryEncoding).\u00a0JsonFileReader and\u00a0Writer need this stuff but that should really be separate from vector since that isn't\u00a0focused on a real use case from my perspective (or maybe even just move to tests).\u00a0"
