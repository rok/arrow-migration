        "title": "[Python] Support caller-provided filesystem in `ParquetWriter` constructor",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3916](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3916). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently to write files incrementally to S3, the following pattern appears necessary:\r\n\r\n`def write_dfs_to_s3(dfs, fname):`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 first_df = dfs[0]`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 table = pa.Table.from_pandas(first_df, preserve_index=False)`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 fs = s3fs.S3FileSystem()`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 fh = fs.open(fname, 'wb')`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 with pq.ParquetWriter(fh, table.schema) as writer:`\r\n\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 # set file handle on writer so writer manages closing it when it is itself closed`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 writer.file_handle = fh`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 writer.write_table(table=table)`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 for df in dfs[1:]:`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df, preserve_index=False)`\r\n`\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 writer.write_table(table=table)`\r\n\r\nThis works as expected, but is quite roundabout. It would be much easier if `ParquetWriter` supported `filesystem` as a keyword argument in its constructor, in which case the `_get_fs_from_path` would be overriden by the usual pattern of using the kwarg after ensuring it is a proper file system with `_ensure_filesystem`.",
