Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe're having an increasing number of nightly builds which makes the nightly report harder to read. Not mentioning the long URLs we have which is hard to express in a plaintext email.\r\n\r\nThe Apache mailing lists prefer plaintext format [1], though we could make an exception for the nightly build report (assuming it wouldn't bounce).\r\n\r\n[1]: https://infra.apache.org/contrib-email-tips#nohtml",
