Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI discovered by symbol sleuthing that even if the Brotli shared libraries are available on the system, the static libraries will be used for linking. Here's a dump of the symbols on my machine\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/wesm/b7e911424ce3ca3a175b652666fe6f89\r\n\r\nThe largest of these symbols `kBrotliDictionaryData` is 120KB\r\n\r\nSince we statically link everything in our Python wheels, we might consider disabling Brotli in manylinux builds at least since it adds 800KB to libarrow.so",

It's a bit doubtful whether Brotli-compressed files are in wide use, however. I'm fine with leaving it in the wheels but we shouldn't statically link when we have the shared lib available in any case"
