        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9698). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-2275 introduced a `#ifndef NDEBUG` check around a function\u00a0which caused the function to to be omitted during release builds.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, ARROW-2313 added -DNDEBUG flags to the\u00a0[pkg-config cmake definition](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1752) so that anyone using the release build of the package would not run into any issues with the missing code. As a result of this change,`pkg-config arrow --cflags` results in -DNDEBUG being added as a compiler flag, forcing itself on the downstream project whenever the dependency is located using pkg-config --.\r\n\r\nThe original `#ifndef NDEBUG` change was\u00a0[reverted](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1756) with ARROW-2316, but the workaround in ARROW-2313 remains.\r\n\r\nI am proposing to revert the workaround in ARROW-2313 so that downstream projects may link against the release build of arrow without adopting the -DNDEBUG flag unnecessarily.",
