Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis code is growing less maintainable. I think we can remove these backwards compatibility hacks since there are released versions of pyarrow that can be used to read old metadata and \"fix\" Parquet files if need be",

Or at least we have something to communicate about like: \"files written by pyarrow >= xx can be read\""
