Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-3254, I am adding the functionality to create test executables from multiple files that use googletest. So we can continue to have relatively small unit test files, but combine unit tests into groups of semantically-related functionality. ",
