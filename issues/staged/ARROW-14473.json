Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNode may have problems reading and writing files when called using nohup. Directly running \r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\nenv \"TEST_DEFAULT=0\" env \"TEST_JS=1\"  bash dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh source 6.0.0 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nseems to work, but\r\n```bash\n\r\nnohup env \"TEST_DEFAULT=0\" env \"TEST_JS=1\"  bash dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh source 6.0.0 3 > log.out &\r\n```\r\nmay not work [1]. Either document that one can use \r\n```bash\n\r\n(nohup env \"TEST_DEFAULT=0\" env \"TEST_JS=1\"  bash dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh source 6.0.0 3 > log.out & )\r\n```\r\nor modify the javascript implementation so that it can run as a background process and still find files so that the error:\r\n```bash\n\r\nyarn run v1.22.17\r\n$ /tmp/arrow-6.0.0.BDnN3/apache-arrow-6.0.0/js/node_modules/.bin/run-s\r\nclean:all lint build\r\nevents.js:377\r\n        throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event\r\n        ^\r\n\r\nError: EBADF: bad file descriptor, read\r\nEmitted 'error' event on ReadStream instance at:\r\n      at internal/fs/streams.js:173:14\r\n      at FSReqCallback.wrapper [as oncomplete] (fs.js:562:5) {\r\n    errno: -9,\r\n    code: 'EBADF',\r\n    syscall: 'read'\r\n}\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\r\n```\r\nis not obtained.\r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16604176/error-ebadf-bad-file-descriptor-when-running-node-using-nohup-of-forever\r\n",
