Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIs there a way to set specific ACL args to the new written files via the S3FileSystem? We have a situation where the writer/read role groups do not have access unless specified during the write process.\r\n\r\nExample of how we update with `s3fs`:\r\n```python\n\r\ns3fs.S3FileSystem(\r\n s3_additional_kwargs={'ACL': 'bucket-owner-full-control'}\r\n)\n```\r\nor with `boto`:\r\n```python\n\r\nextra_args.update(\\{\"ACL\": \"bucket-owner-full-control\"})\r\nboto3.s3.transfer.S3Transfer(...).upload_file(extra_args=extra_args)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```python\n\r\ns3.Object(my_bucket_name, my_key_path).put(Body=my_body, ACL='bucket-owner-full-control')\r\n```",
