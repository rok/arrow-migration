Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI tried increasing the re2 version to 2020-11-01 in ARROW-11350 but it failed in a few builds with \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n/usr/bin/ar: /root/rpmbuild/BUILD/apache-arrow-3.1.0.dev107/cpp/build/re2_ep-install/lib/libre2.a: No such file or directory\r\nmake[2]: *** [release/libarrow_bundled_dependencies.a] Error 9\r\nmake[1]: *** [src/arrow/CMakeFiles/arrow_bundled_dependencies.dir/all] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n(or similar). My theory is that something changed in their cmake build setup so that either libre2.a is not where we expect it, or it's building a shared library instead, or something.",
