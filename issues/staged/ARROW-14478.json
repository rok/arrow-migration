Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nObserved in [AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/41288964/job/6s4bx6cd2kc6eld6) on the main branch:\r\n```\n\r\n[ RUN      ] TestScan/TestCsvFileFormatScan.ScanBatchSize/0AsyncThreaded16b1024r\r\nunknown file: error: SEH exception with code 0xc00000fd thrown in the test body.\r\n[  FAILED  ] TestScan/TestCsvFileFormatScan.ScanBatchSize/0AsyncThreaded16b1024r, where GetParam() = AsyncThreaded16b1024r (250 ms)\n```\r\nFrom some searching, this code corresponds to a stack overflow. We've previously seen errors similar to this, so it might be good to identify and track this down too. (It seems less likely on Linux due to the larger default stack size.)",
