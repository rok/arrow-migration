Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile looking at some basic instrumentation, I noticed SourceNode calls InputReceived directly in its Loop handler, meaning that we only ever process one batch at a time (barring a pipeline breaker). We should instead submit batches in parallel.",
