        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18354](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18354). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen a user opens a CSV dataset using open_dataset, they can take advantage of a lot of different options which can be specified via `CsvReadOptions$create()` etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, as they are passed in via the ellipses (`...`) argument, it's not particularly clear to users which arguments are supported or not.  They are not documented in the `open_dataset()` docs, and further confused (see the code for `CsvFileFormat$create()` by the fact that we support a mix of Arrow and readr parameters (though users can't use both at the same time).\r\n\r\nWe should better document the arguments we do support.\r\n\r\n",
