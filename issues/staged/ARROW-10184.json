Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOnce basic continuation support is in, if we can add futures to a task group, and a task group completion can be expressed as a future, then we can use task groups in such a way that they will not deadlock.\r\n\r\nThis task focuses on the ability to add a future to a task group instead of spawning a new task.",
