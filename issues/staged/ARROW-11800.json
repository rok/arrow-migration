        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11800](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11800). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently Scan generates an ordered sequence of batches.\u00a0 However, this is not ideal.\u00a0 For example, consider reading four parquet files in parallel from S3.\u00a0 There is no good way to determine which read will finish first.\u00a0 If file 2 finishes before file 1 then we could start parsing the contents of file 2 immediately but we currently do not.\r\n\r\nThere could then be an option provided by Scan whether to preserve ordering or not.\u00a0 Cases that do not care about ordering (e.g. count rows) could take advantage of this to reduce memory pressure.\r\n\r\nNote: This will be an optimization even for cases that do care about ordering.\u00a0 We could still parse / project / etc. out of order and simply reorder at the end.\u00a0 The only difference between unordered and ordered then will be the memory pressure applied.",
