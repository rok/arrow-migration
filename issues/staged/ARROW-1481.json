        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1481](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1481). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollow up to ARROW-229. Some projects may reuse temporary buffers, so presuming you know how much memory to allocate, you will want to be able to invoke the cast closures in generic way.\n\nThe API created in doing this should be deemed experimental as we iterate towards a more generic analytical kernel evaluation model",
