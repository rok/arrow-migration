Including libutf8proc implicitly does that, but it seems ARROW-4065 intentionally removed the transitive dependencies from ArrowTargets.cmake. Instead downstream projects depending on Arrow can use `target_link_directories(..., path/to/conda/env/lib)` (it seems this is really only an issue when using Conda). Closing."
