        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10632](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10632). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the R package will you please export make_readable_file() ?\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe want to interact with Feather files in our R package and are using arrow::FeatherReader$create(), which requires as input an Arrow file connection object. We thought we would follow the lead in read_feather() and use make_readable_file() like\r\n```java\n\r\nf <- function(file) {\r\n  file <- make_readable_file(file)\r\n  on.exit(file$close())\r\n  reader <- FeatherReader$create(file)\r\n# do stuff ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut make_readable_file is not exported by arrow, so this approach might not satisfy CRAN requirements.\r\n\r\nCan you export make_readable_file? Or is there some other preferred way to go from a .feather file to the required inputstream for FeatherReader$create?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

There's not much it can do other than read the data into a Table."

Thank you!\r\n\r\nWe were just trying to have a non-exported function in our package that is basically read_feather with tidy select syntax\r\n```java\n\r\nread_feather_tidyselect <- function(.data, ...) {\r\n  .data <- arrow::mmap_open(.data)\r\n  on.exit(.data$close())\r\n  reader <- arrow::FeatherReader$create(.data)  \r\n  col_select <- rlang::enquos(...)\r\n  columns <- if (length(col_select) != 0) {\r\n    tidyselect::vars_select(names(reader), !!!col_select)\r\n  }  \r\n  out <- reader$Read(columns) %>% as.data.frame()  \r\n  out\r\n}\r\n```\r\nso one could do something like read_feather_tidyselect(file, var1, var2, matches(\"something\")).\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
