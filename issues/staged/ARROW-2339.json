I was wondering if you had any thoughts on using xxHash, MumrurHash or FNV-1a for this? I was going to do some timing this weekend as well as testing for collisions on various ints as you mentioned on the original ticket. Do you know if we can use existing implementations of the hash from C or C++ with wrappers? I didn't know what ASF rules might be on that with regard to licenses (only ASF or MIT/BSD allowed) and adding the Cython wrappers to PyArrow. If it's better just to do a new implementation I'll work on that too, but didn't want to reinvent a wheel if I didn't need to."

Any performance-critical operation should use bulk routines coded in C++ instead of micro-optimizing an inherently slow Python wrapper."
