Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen calling the \"variance\", \"stddev\", \"hash_variance\", and \"hash_stddev\" kernels, there is no option to handle NA values and they are currently ignored - could we have an option added, so that if there are NA values, we get an NA back?",
