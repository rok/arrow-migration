Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis header has grown quite large and any given compilation unit's use of it is likely limited to only a couple of functions or classes. I suspect it would improve compilation time to split up this header into a few headers organized by frequency of code use. ",
