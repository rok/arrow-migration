Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe objective of this change would be to make it easier for toolchain builders to ship bundled thirdparty libraries together with the Arrow libraries in case there is a particular library version that is only used when linking with `libarrow.a`. In theory configuration could be added to arrowTargets.cmake (or pkgconfig) to simplify static linking",
