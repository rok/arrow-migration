        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8710](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8710). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen an Arrow IPC stream is completed, the continuation marker needs to first be written, followed by a series of 4 zero-bytes indicating the end-of-stream. This change ensures this sequence is observed correctly.\r\n\r\nAlso, the underlying stream needs to be flushed otherwise writes can (and do) get lost.",
