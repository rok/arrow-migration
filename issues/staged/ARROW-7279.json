Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis would be consistent with `UnionType::type_codes`. Furthermore, \"type_id\" already means something else in the C++ API, so it would be less confusing as well.",
