        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9386](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9386). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRecordBatch.schema() should not return &Arc<Schema>. It should either return &Schema or Arc<Schema>.\r\n\r\nGiven that the schema could be a large nested structure and other code may want to keep references to it, Arc<Schema> is probably best.\r\n\r\nReturning a reference to an Arc just doesn't make much sense, IMHO, and I think I was responsible for introducing this early on.",
