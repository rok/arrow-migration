        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15299](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15299). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAlthough the `remotes::install_deps()` docs state\u00a0`dependencies == TRUE` is equivalent to `{}dependencies == \"soft\"{`}, I suspect `\"soft\"` is a bit more recursive than `{}TRUE{`}, resulting in the installation of many more packages.\r\n> TRUE is shorthand for \"Depends\", \"Imports\", \"LinkingTo\" and \"Suggests\". NA is shorthand for \"Depends\", \"Imports\" and \"LinkingTo\" and is the default. FALSE is shorthand for no dependencies (i.e. just check this package, not its dependencies).\n> \n> The value \"soft\" means the same as TRUE, \"hard\" means the same as NA.\r\n\r\nI noticed, when using `dependencies = \"soft\"` that my session was being clogged up by package installations lasting well over 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nI would be good to time box this to a couple of hours. \r\n\r\nThe direction in which I would go would be to understand if there is any difference in the size of the dependency trees + come up with a minimal reproducible example. \r\n\r\nEdit (12 January, 2021): the output could be a table comparing  \r\n```r\n\r\nremotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)\r\nremotes::install_deps(dependencies = \"hard\")\r\nremotes::install_deps(dependencies = c(\"hard\", \"Config...\"))\r\nremotes::install_deps(dependencies = \"soft\")\r\nremotes::install_deps(dependencies = c(\"soft\", \"Config...\"))\r\n```",
