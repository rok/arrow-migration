Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLike ARROW-2195, but for Create() instead of Get(). Need creating a new C++ API and using it on the Python side.\r\n \\* Create() currently increments the reference count twice\r\n \\* Both Seal() and Release() decrement the reference count\r\n \\* The returned buffer must also handle the case where Seal() wasn't called : first Release() then Abort()",

This way we get get rid of the Abort() call.\r\n\r\nMove the Seal() method into the MutablePlasmaBuffer and let it return the object ID."
