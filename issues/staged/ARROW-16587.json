Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile working on ARROW-15732 I found that plans which failed partway through often ended up with a segmentation fault or assert instead of calmly reporting the error.  We should probably have more tests in place which test failure in various spots of the execution engine to ensure that we recover more robustly.",
