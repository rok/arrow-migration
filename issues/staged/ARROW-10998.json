        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10998](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10998). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when passing a URI to a filesystem method (except for `from_uri`) or other functions that accept a filesystem object, you can get a rather cryptic error message (eg in this case about \"No response body\" for S3, in the example below). \r\n\r\nIdeally, the filesystem object knows its own prefix \"scheme\", and so can detect if a user is passing a URI instead of file path, and we can provide a nicer error message.\r\n\r\nExample with S3:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\n>>> from pyarrow.fs import S3FileSystem\r\n>>> fs = S3FileSystem(region=\"us-east-2\")\r\n>>> fs.get_file_info('s3://ursa-labs-taxi-data/2016/01/')\r\n...\r\nOSError: When getting information for key '/ursa-labs-taxi-data/2016/01' in bucket 's3:': AWS Error [code 100]: No response body.\r\n\r\n>>> import pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n>>> table = pq.read_table('s3://ursa-labs-taxi-data/2016/01/data.parquet', filesystem=fs)\r\n...\r\nOSError: When getting information for key '/ursa-labs-taxi-data/2016/01/data.parquet' in bucket 's3:': AWS Error [code 100]: No response body.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a local filesystem, you actually get a not found file:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> fs = LocalFileSystem()\r\n>>> fs.get_file_info(\"file:///home\")\r\n<FileInfo for 'file:///home': type=FileType.NotFound>\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc `[~apitrou]`",
