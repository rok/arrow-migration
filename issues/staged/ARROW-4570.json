Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor decimals, overflows can occur at two places :\r\n1. input array can have values that are outside the bound (eg. > 38 digits)\n1. When an operation can result in overflows. eg. add of two decimals of (38, 6) can result in an overflow, if the input numbers are very large.\n   \n   In both the above cases, just verifying that an overflow occurred can be a perf overhead. We should do this based on a conf variable.",
