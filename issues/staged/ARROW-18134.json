        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18134](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18134). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI don't think we are quite ready (need some of the options handling things to stabilize) but pretty soon we should be able to pass (or expected fail) the tests defined at https://github.com/substrait-io/consumer-testing\r\n\r\nWe should add some portion of these tests to our CI as an integration test (nightly is fine) so that we can detect when Substrait definitions change (this should eventually be a rare / non-existent event but in the meantime it is not)",
