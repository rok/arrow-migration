I would think that we would rather go back to a specific commit and would run our docker scripts with this commit than having scripts that checkout Arrow at a specific hash but don't use its scripts. The documentation and its build process will always be bound to code tree. For now I have started in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2856 to build the documentation into a `/latest/` folder. We probably want to be able to parametrize this and build the documentation for releases into a different folder."
