Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`docs/source/developers/archery.rst` says to use the following command to install Archery:\r\n```Java\n\r\npip install -e dev/archery\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this is only going to install the basic dependencies, but depending on the subcommand Archery may need additional dependencies. The command should instead be:\r\n```Java\n\r\npip install -e dev/archery[all]\r\n```\r\n",

This is also discussed in <https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2/issues/999>\u00a0 With the default install this does not happen.\u00a0 Maybe an update should be made to reflect this? Likely ok for 7.0, if so can raise a new issue."
