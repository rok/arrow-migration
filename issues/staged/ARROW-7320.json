Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was building Arrow on bullx Linux (a Linux distribution compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux).\r\n\r\nCMake options:\r\n```Java\n\r\n-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\r\n-DARROW_FLIGHT=ON\r\n-DARROW_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON\r\n```\r\n\r\n`make` failed with the following error message:\r\n```Java\n\r\nScanning dependencies of target arrow-type-benchmark\r\n[ 72%] Building CXX object src/arrow/CMakeFiles/arrow-type-benchmark.dir/type_benchmark.cc.o\r\nmake[2]: *** No rule to make target `gbenchmark_ep/src/gbenchmark_ep-install/lib/libbenchmark_main.a', needed by `debug/arrow-type-benchmark'.  Stop.\r\nmake[1]: *** [src/arrow/CMakeFiles/arrow-type-benchmark.dir/all] Error 2\r\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to the same reason as mentioned in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4246/commits/f6b0bc7f8dc56f02e2778752235e728b7623a9ee):\r\n\r\nIf `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib` is not explicitly set, `libbenchmark_main.a` will be put in `lib64` instead of `lib`.",
