Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe LogicalPlan currently has a TableScan entry which references a Table (any logical plan registered with an ExecutionContext) and is often backed by a Parquet or CSV data source.\r\n\r\nI am finding it increasingly inconvenient that we can't just create a logical plan referencing a Parquet or CSV file, without having to create an execution context first and register the data sources with it.\r\n\r\nThis addition will not remove any existing behavior.",
