Meson supports Visual Studio.\nMeson: http://mesonbuild.com/\n\nThe latest GLib itself has migrated to Meson build system.

You want to know why Meson is better than CMake, right?\n\nMeson has built-in GObject Introspection support: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/blob/master/mesonbuild/modules/gnome.py#L396\nCMake doesn't. If we use CMake, we need to implement GObject Introspection related build configurations.\n\nSo I suggest that we use Meson than CMake."

My biggest hurdle right now is figuring out CMake and Autotools.\n\nAfter a few hours yesterday I'm up and running on Meson, even on windows (normally anything not VS based is painful).  Of course, I still need to learn Autotools if I am to make any impact on this issue...\n\nI think you should consider using Meson throughout, just my opinion."
