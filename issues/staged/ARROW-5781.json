Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFound that ursabot would always compare the PR tip commit with itself via https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4739#issuecomment-506819250 . This is due to buildbot github behavior of using a git-reset --hard local that changes the `master` rev to this new state. ",
