        "title": "[R] [C++] Implement substr/str_sub for dplyr queries",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13188). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would be highly desirable to be able to use (base) substr and/or (stringr) str_sub in dplyr queries, like\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(stringr)\r\n\r\n# get animal products, year 20919\r\nopen_dataset(\r\n  \"../cepii-datasets-arrow/parquet/baci_hs92\",\r\n  partitioning = c(\"year\", \"reporter_iso\")\r\n) %>% \r\n  filter(\r\n    year == 2019,\r\n    str_sub(product_code, 1, 2) == \"01\"\r\n  ) %>% \r\n  collect()\r\n\r\nError: Filter expression not supported for Arrow Datasets: str_sub(product_code, 1, 2) == \"01\"\r\nCall collect() first to pull data into R.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, this needs implementation, but similar to ARROW-13107, points to an easier integration with dplyr.\r\n",
