Because nvidia-cuda-toolkit package isn't available for arm64.\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6715\r\n\r\nNvidia supports Cuda on ARM, so this should be possible in principle?\r\n\r\nPlease also clarify the relation with https://github.com/alibaba/libvineyard Do you intend to continue develop Plasma?",

If you're interested in Ubuntu packages, could you report it (libcuda1 package for arm64 is missing) to Ubuntu?\r\n\r\nDebian: Buster provides nvidia-cuda-toolkit package by backports: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=nvidia-cuda-toolkit\r\nBackports for Buster also provides libcuda1 package: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libcuda\r\nWe can provide packages for Buster with backports."
