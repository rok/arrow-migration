Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- When I using pyarrow flight client get remote data, I encounter the \"assertion failed\" problem:  ![image-2020-11-21-23-32-35-346.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13015790/image-2020-11-21-23-32-35-346.png)\n   \\* I use the flight example code (client.py & server.py): <https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/python/examples/flight>\n   \\* It seems the grpc bug. And it is similar with the previous problem (<font color=\"#ff0000\">also on mac os</font>):\u00a0\n   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7689\u00a0.\n   And the record of grpc is :\u00a0<https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/20311>\n   \\* <font color=\"#ff0000\">In my project, the version of pyarrow is 2.0.0, and the version of grpcio is 1.33.2. Both are the latest version.</font>\n  \n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ![image-2020-11-21-23-33-30-170.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13015789/image-2020-11-21-23-33-30-170.png) \u00a0\n   \\* <font color=\"#ff0000\">When I change the version of pyarrow from 2.0.0 to 0.17.1, the problem disappeared.</font>",
