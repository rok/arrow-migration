        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9960](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9960). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nEncryption key material keeps the information required to recover the keys by Parquet readers. Currently, only \"internal storage mode\" is supported, where the key material is stored inside Parquet file footers, and therefore can't be rotated (re-wrapped with refreshed master keys) in immutable files. The new mechanism in this Jira adds the advanced \"external storage mode\" for the key material, where the key material is stored in separate small files, that enable the key rotation. This mechanism will also implement the key rotation functionality.",
