        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10565](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10565). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe functions `pyarrow.Table.from_batches` and `pyarrow.Table.from_pandas` both allow for passing of `Schema` objects.\r\n\r\nBoth methods currently take in an argument called `Schema_schema`, whereas the documentation describes it should be `schema`, of type `Schema`.\r\n\r\nThe other `.from_XX` methods correctly take the argument as just `schema`.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFixing this just involves changing these two keyword arguments.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI find that I only had type errors, the compiled function that is called already expects the argument to be called `schema`. Thus this is only a documentation issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

In which documentation? Eg looking at https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Table.html#pyarrow.Table.from_pandas, this looks good to me."

Initially I had a TypeError in Python when trying to pass `schema=...`. Later I checked and it showed the argument as `Schema_schema` (through the help function).\r\nNow I'm thinking it may have been my IDE (custom Emacs..) having a hiccup. I guess I will close this and update if and when I experience it again."

(that seems where the \"Schema_schema\" is coming from, as in cython the signature is `Schema schema`)"
