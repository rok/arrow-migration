Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently only parquet is supported. IPC files make a nice test case for multiple file formats since they also have a completely unambiguous physical schema (unlike CSV) and support for reading/writing is already present.",

Ideally nothing breaks and adding IpcFormat takes a week and brings us \"Mixing different file formats\" as a bonus. Otherwise we find pain points in the scanner API **before** we're also using it to test the (probably much more complex) CsvFormat. The same reasoning applies to writing datasets; most of our tests will probably just assume working scanners and do round trips. Finally, although we started by scanning ParquetFormat I think IpcFormat is the ideal format to start working on writing since there is so little impedance mismatch between it and in-memory structures."
