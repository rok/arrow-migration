Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs far as I can tell, fixed size binary is the only non-nullable type when reading a CSV file.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if fixed size binary columns respected the same null values as other columns (those in `ConvertOptions::null_values`).",
