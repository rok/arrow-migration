        "title": "[C++] Multi argument operator kernel behavior for decimal columns",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1761](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1761). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a JIRA to discuss the behavior of operator kernels that require more than one decimal column input where the column types have a different `scale` parameter.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\na: decimal(12, 2)\r\nb: decimal(10, 3)\r\n\r\nc = a + b\r\n```\r\n\r\nArithmetic is the primary use case, but anything that needs to efficiently operate on decimal columns with different scales would require this functionality.\r\n\r\nI imagine that `[~jnadeau]` and folks at Dremio have thought about and solved the problem in Java. If so, we should consider implementing this behavior in C++. Otherwise, I'll do a bit of reading and digging to see how existing systems efficiently handle this problem.",
