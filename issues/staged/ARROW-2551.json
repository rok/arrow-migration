Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are\u00a0a few issues in current Plasma notification code:\r\n \\* When a client subscribes to Plasma, the store pushes notifications about existing objects to ALL subscribers, while it should only push to the new subscriber.\r\n \\* And in the above scenario, it should only push \"sealed\" objects to the new subscriber, while currently it pushes all objects regardless of the state.\r\n \\* When a client disconnects, it will no longer be able to receive notifications, thus the NotificationQueue for the client should be removed from global map.",

Good to know that it fixed your issue:)\r\n\r\nFor the order of notifications, there are two cases:\r\n\r\n1) When a client\u00a0subscribes to plasma store, the store will push notifications for all existing objects to the new client, in this case there's **no specific order**\u00a0among these notifications - the store simply loop through all the objects from an unordered_map and push notification for each of them.\r\n\r\n2) When a new object is sealed, a notification is pushed to all the clients that have subscribed for notifications. In this case, the object notifications are sent in the order of their **sealed** time, instead of creation time."
