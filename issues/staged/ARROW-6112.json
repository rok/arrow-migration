Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe arrow spec allows for 64 bit address range for buffers (and arrays) we should support this at the API level in Java even if the current Netty backing buffers don't support it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee comment below.\u00a0 This work item will focus on allowing 64-bit addressing in buffers.",
