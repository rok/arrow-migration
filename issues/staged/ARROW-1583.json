Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere's enough things that can go wrong in our CI due to external package registries that we can often end up with spurious failures not caused by code changes.\n\nFor example, here is an NPM registry failure:\n\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/277798491#L941\n\nI have seen Maven Central fail or anaconda.org fail in the past, too. Some of these package commands that hit external resources could be wrapped in `travis_retry` to give them another shot at success",
