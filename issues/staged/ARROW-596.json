This might be something like a bytes, bytearray, memoryview, or sequence of those."

Converting to bytes is bad because it is a memory copy\n\nIs there a way to do a zero-copy memory handoff to a memoryview? I can dig into how NumPy provides a zero-copy buffer interface but in case you know off hand the right tool to use"

I've never used it but it looks similar to what you would do in C.\n\nNote that pyarrow.Buffer needs to be a fixed-size buffer for that operation to make sense. If not, then __getbuffer__ should lock the buffer size until __releasebuffer__ is called."
