Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI found there were TableReaders for CSV & JSON formats. It would be very nice if we also supported Protobuf format.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is user passing in both the data file & the protobuf descriptor. The protobuf messages are delimited like CSV or prefixed by (maybe encoded in someway) message length.",
