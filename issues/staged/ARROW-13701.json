Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I load the R package and try to run unit tests (via `devtools::load_all()` and `devtools::test()`, it results in a segfault. \r\n\r\nI've played around with a few commits and I think this is the one after which I get this problem\r\n\r\nI can't copy and paste as it crashes RStudio, but a screenshot is attached - it references process_memory_range.cc\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any more info from me, I'll try to narrow it down a little in the meantime.\r\n\r\n",
