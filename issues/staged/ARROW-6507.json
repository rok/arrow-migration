Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom discussing ARROW-6506, `[~bkietz]` said: an extension type might place more constraints on an array than those implicit in its storage type, and users will probably expect to be able to plug those into `Validate`.\r\n\r\nSo we could have a `ExtensionType::ValidateArray` (resp. `ValidateArrayFull`) that the visitor for `ExtensionArray` can call, similarly like there is also an `ExtensionType::ExtensionEquals` that the visitor calls when extension types are checked for equality.",
