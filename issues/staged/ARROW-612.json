        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-612). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOften when comparing Schemas, I'll see an error message like below because of differing schemas.  The only difference is one is nullable and one is not, but that info is not printed in the `Field.toString` method.\n\n```\n - numeric type conversion *** FAILED *** (118 milliseconds)\n[info]   java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Different schemas:\n[info] Schema<i: Int(32, true)>\n[info] Schema<i: Int(32, true)>\n[info]   at org.apache.arrow.vector.util.Validator.compareSchemas(Validator.java:43)\n```\n\nI would be nice to match the C++ `Field.toString` that prints \" not null \" only if the nullable flag is not set.  Which would then look like this\n```\n[info] Schema<i: Int(32, true) not null>\n[info] Schema<i: Int(32, true)>\n```",
