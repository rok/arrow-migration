Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nEncountered while testing 0.4.0 rc1, but not a blocker. The test `pyarrow.tests.test_hdfs.TestLibHdfs testMethod=test_hdfs_read_multiple_parquet_files` needs to be fixed now that DataFrame indexes are written to Parquet files by default. We should figure out how to test the HDFS integration in some CI",
