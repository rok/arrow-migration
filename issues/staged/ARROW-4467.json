Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a user, I would like to be able to simply `docker pull apache/arrow-datafusion` and run interactive and batch queries against my data sources.\r\n\r\nThis will require `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` to be implemented. I suggest referring to Apache Hive for syntax.\r\n\r\nWith this feature, it will be possible for users to start using DataFusion for some simple real world ETL use cases.",
