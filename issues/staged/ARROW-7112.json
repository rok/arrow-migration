Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen initializing a Table from a boolean pandas.DataFrame\u00a0_that is not in Fortran order_, the contents of the resulting Table is different from the contents of the DataFrame.\r\n\r\nSample:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nmask = np.full((3,3), False)\r\nmask[:,1] = True\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(mask)\r\nprint(df)\r\nprint(pa.table(df).to_pandas()) \r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe output:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```\n\r\n       0     1      2\r\n0  False  True  False\r\n1  False  True  False\r\n2  False  True  False\r\n       0      1      2\r\n0  False   True  False\r\n1  False  False  False\r\n2  False  False  False\r\n```\r\nI.e., column 1 is different before and after roundtripping through pa.Table.\r\n\r\nIf I add **`order='F'`** to the **`np.full`** invocation, the result is as expected. Also, the problem seems to disappear if I use `*dtype=int*`.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
