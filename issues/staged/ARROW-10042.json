Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTwo (byte) buffers are equal if their contents are equal.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently,\u00a0`BufferData` comparison (`PartialEq`) uses its `capacity` as part of the comparison. Therefore, two slices are considered different even when their content is the same but the corresponding `BufferData` has a different capacity.\r\n\r\nSince this equality is used by `Buffer`'s equality, which is used by all our arrays, currently arrays are different when their contents are the same but the underlying capacity is different. I am not sure that this is what we want.",
