Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nProvide a (private api) C function that converts/wraps a C++ `arrow::Table` to a Python `pyarrow.Table`. This can be used so that libraries depending on Arrow can expose their C++ results to Python without the need for a Cython dependency.",
