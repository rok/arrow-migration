Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, `getBufferSizeFor`\u00a0in `BaseRepeatedValueVector`\u00a0implemented as below:\r\n```java\n\r\nif (valueCount == 0) {\r\n\r\n\u00a0 return 0;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn ((valueCount + 1) * OFFSET_WIDTH) + vector.getBufferSizeFor(valueCount);\r\n```\r\nHere vector.getBufferSizeFor(valueCount)\u00a0seems not right which should be\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nint innerVectorValueCount = offsetBuffer.getInt(valueCount * OFFSET_WIDTH);\r\n\r\nvector.getBufferSizeFor(innerVectorValueCount)\r\n```\r\n\u00a0ListVector has the same problem.",
