Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrayDataBuilder allows the user to specify a null count, alternatively calculating it if it is not set.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the user-specified null count is never validated against the actual count of the buffer.\r\n\r\nI suggest removing the ability to specify a null-count, and instead always calculating it.",
