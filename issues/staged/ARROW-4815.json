I have made a bit of progress on this. Made the types, and have been fixing up errors. You say it may be a bit of work so maybe its harder than it seems, but I think I have been doing pretty well so far.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere is my branch so far: <https://github.com/sinistersnare/arrow/commit/ba465f88b9ef9310aec15723756ddfa95a226119>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you think that there is a better issue for me, let me know, I would be happy to help. I just kind of look at the '1.0.0 release' supertask and picked this one."
