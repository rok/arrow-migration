Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm passing these flags to CMake:\n\n\"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\"\n\"-DARROW_WITH_ZSTD=off\"\n\"-DARROW_WITH_LZ4=off\"\n\"-DARROW_BUILD_TESTS=off\"\n\"-DARROW_BUILD_STATIC=off\"\n\nBased on that, I expect arrow to build only shared libraries. However, the build process fails when ld tries to link against 'arrow_static':\n\n> /gnu/store/4iw4r2majarqlm19adaikqw126jxqf2p-gcc-5.4.0/bin/c++    -O3 -DNDEBUG -Wall -std=c++11 -msse3  -fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden -O3 -DNDEBUG   CMakeFiles/file-to-stream.dir/file-to-stream.cc.o  -o ../../../release/file-to-stream -rdynamic -larrow_static -lpthread /gnu/store/viqagcaanr044k1x1mx9kkbg0z5i8ii4-boost-1.63.0/lib/libboost_filesystem.so /gnu/store/viqagcaanr044k1x1mx9kkbg0z5i8ii4-boost-1.63.0/lib/libboost_system.so -ldl\n> ld: cannot find -larrow_static",
