We might collect data on what other projects do in this regard. I would opt for developer control, though, so this might be something we make configurable (whether type inferences tries boolean by default or not)"

Sorry for my ambiguous title.\r\n\r\nI think that specifying type explicitly is very useful. But type inference is also useful even if it may choose wrong type because it's convenient. If type inference is failed, we can specify type explicitly. It's convenience than we specify all types explicitly."
