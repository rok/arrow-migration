Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn arrow dataset, Filter pushdown can improve reading files performance greatly. We notice parquet has implemented, https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/35b3567e73423420a99dbe6116f000e3c77d2a4c/cpp/src/arrow/dataset/file_parquet.cc#L465-L484.\r\nBut ORC fileformat has not supported Filter pushdown. It ignores the \"filter\" of \u00a0ScanOptions now.",

This is similar to Arrow's expressions.  So work would need to be done to convert from an Arrow expression to an Orc \"search argument\".  I see some code for both bloom filters and min/max statistics for stripes so I would presume they are using both under the hood.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we could use this information to attach a guarantee to the resulting batches but that could be a follow-up enhancement.\r\n\r\nWe should ideally test for tricky cases like \"the expression references fields not included in this orc file\" or \"the expression references fields that don't have statistics (I'm not sure if statistics are optional or not in Orc)\""

I'm guessing there is a fair amount of complexity and some tricky test cases that will need to be written."
