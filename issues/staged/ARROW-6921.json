        "title": " Regression: Cannot round-trip IPC files between PyArrow and Arrow JS",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6921](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6921). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOriginally raised by\u00a0[Sarath](https://stackoverflow.com/users/403133/sarath) on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58313254), reporting here as I've run into this issue as well.\r\n\r\nWhen exporting an Arrow table using PyArrow, ArrowJS incorrectly imports it as a 0-row table, skipping any data in the table. The schema is imported correctly, including metadata, but the length of the table is 0.\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pydict( {\"a\": [1, 2, 3], \"b\": [4, 5, 6]} )\r\n\r\nwith pa.RecordBatchFileWriter('file.arrow', table.schema) as writer:\r\n    writer.write_table(table)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `file.arrow` was generated with PyArrow 0.15, the following JS snippet will fail. However, if you generated it with PyArrow 0.14, then the JS snippet will work as expected:\r\n\r\n```javascript\n\r\nconst { readFileSync } = require(\"fs\");\r\nconst { Table } = require(\"apache-arrow\");\r\n\r\nconst data = readFileSync(\"file.arrow\");\r\nconst table = Table.from([ data ]);\r\n\r\nconsole.assert(table.length === 3, \"Table should have 3 rows\");\r\nconsole.assert(table.get(0) != null, \"First row should not be null\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested with PyArrow 0.14.1, 0.15.0, and ArrowJS 0.13.0 and 0.14.1.",

But AFAICT there hasn't been a JS 0.15 release:\u00a0<https://www.npmjs.com/package/apache-arrow>. So maybe this is an operational issue on the JS side of things?"
