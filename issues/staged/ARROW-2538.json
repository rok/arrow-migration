        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2538](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2538). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen a data set has null values in complex data type, it's hard to call proper writeNull method. Because writeNull is declared in AbstractFieldWriter, which is package local, not public. Moreover, UnionListWriter has no implementation of writeNull method, so it falls into AbstractFieldWriter.writeNull, which throws an IllegalArgumentException by default. So BaseWriter.writeNull is required to write null values inside of complex data types.",
