Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowup to ARROW-15271. Among the objectives:\r\n\r\n- Push KVM handling in ExecPlan so that Run() preserves the R metadata we want; also remove the duplicate handling of it for Write()\n- Better encapsulate KVM for the the $metadata and $r_metadata so that as a user/developer, you never have to touch the serialize/deserialize functions, you just have a list to work with\n- Factor out a common utility in r/src for taking cpp11::strings (named character vector) and producing arrow::KeyValueMetadata",
