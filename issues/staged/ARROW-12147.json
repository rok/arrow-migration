Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhi arrow developers,\u00a0\r\n\r\nGandiva supports timestamp related functions already - but it looks like UTC only. It would be nice to support TimestampTZ(timestamp with timezone) also. Pass timestamp w/ timezone to those functions will return wrong result(should consider the timezone offset)\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/gandiva/precompiled/time.cc#L41>\r\n\r\nI guess we could provide a helper func like below to convert to timestamp w/ UTC first, then all existing functions should be working correctly.\u00a0\r\n\r\n`_ConvertTIMESTAMP(timestamp, timezone)_`\r\n\r\nA better way may require re-implement those functions by considering the zone offset when doing calculating, but this may make the code looks complicated.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote, castTIMESTAMP_utf8 supports creating timestamp with timezone already.\u00a0\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/gandiva/precompiled/time.cc#L618-L743>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nthanks, -yuan",
