        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11590](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11590). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current readahead accomplishes its task by using an async reentrant readahead.\u00a0 We get away with this today because the background generator is async reentrant because it runs on a thread pool of size 1 and so the underlying thread pool can only iterate the underlying iterator synchronously.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to move to the I/O thread pool we need a readahead operator that is does not pull reentrantly.\r\n\r\nThis can be done either by submitting the next task as soon as the previous one is done or by creating a \"serial concurrency\" executor that wraps an underlying executor.\u00a0 Both approaches will need a queue so this can be done after ARROW-11588",
