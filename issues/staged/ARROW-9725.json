Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBoth LimitExec and SortExec need to collapse inputs down to a single partition and they both contain similar code for executing their inputs on threads and combining the results. This is exactly what the MergeExec operator does, so they should just use that instead.",
