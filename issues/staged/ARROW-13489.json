        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13489). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom the wiki:\r\n\r\nWe have a CI job that will write parquet and feather files with the development branch and then use previous release of arrow to read them in, testing that we maintain backwards compatibility with these formats (for the features that are tested). When there is a release, add the just-released version of arrow to the CI job (called test-r-version-compatibility) The template for this job is https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/r/github.linux.version.compatibility.yml and you will need to add a new line to the matrix under the read-files job with the version just released as the \"old_arrow_version\" along with the current release R version number. We use the release R version to test this backwards compatibility in order to take advantage of binaries built and hosted by RStudio Package Manager which makes installing the release versions of old arrow releases very easy and we don't have to re-create build environments to match them.
