        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7426](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7426). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter installing the R package for arrow, I get the following error when trying to read or write a parquet file:\u00a0\r\n> > read_parquet(\"example.parquet\")\n> Error in io___MemoryMappedFile__Open(path, mode) : \n> Cannot call io___MemoryMappedFile__Open(). Please use arrow::install_arrow() to install required runtime libraries. \n> > write_parquet(mtcars, \"test.parquet\")\n> Error in Table__from_dots(dots, schema) : \n> Cannot call Table__from_dots(). Please use arrow::install_arrow() to install required runtime libraries.\r\nThe problem occurs with both the latest stable release on CRAN and the latest development version from GitHub. I installed the C++ arrow library through conda as there was no working deb package for Ubuntu 19.10.",
