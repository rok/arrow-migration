Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've seen a few people on the mailing list asking for something like this and I've wanted it myself, so I went ahead and implemented a parser for a lisp-like way of generating Expressions. Calls are of the form `{}(<fn> <args>){`}, scalars are of the form `{}$type:value{`}, and field refs are of the form `{}!<dot path>{`}.",
