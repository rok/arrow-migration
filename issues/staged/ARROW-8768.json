Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAn extra check we added to ensure that the package doesn't write anything to the user's home directory started failing on one of the 5 as-cran checks. It appears that a new feature of texlive2020, which is apparently invoked on checking that the pdf manual can be built, adds some caching junk to the home dir. It is unlikely that this is a real failure, probably just an artifact of the test environment. ",
