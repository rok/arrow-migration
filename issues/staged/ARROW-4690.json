        "title": "[Python] Building TensorFlow compatible wheels for Arrow",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4690). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince\u00a0the inclusion of LLVM, arrow wheels stopped working with TensorFlow again (on some configurations at least).\r\n\r\nWhile we are continuing to discuss a more permanent solution in\u00a0[https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/developers/TMqRaT-H2bI/discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/developers/TMqRaT-H2bI/discussion,), I made some progress in creating tensorflow compatible wheels\u00a0for an unmodified pyarrow.\r\n\r\nThey won't adhere to the manylinux1 standard, but they should be as compatible as the TensorFlow wheels because they use the same\u00a0build environment (ubuntu 14.04).\r\n\r\nI'll create a PR with the necessary changes. I don't\u00a0propose to ship these wheels but it might be a good idea to include the docker image and instructions how to build them in the tree for organizations that want to use tensorflow with pyarrow on top of pip. The official recommendation should probably be to use conda if the average user wants to do this for now.",
