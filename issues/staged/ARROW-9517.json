        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9517](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9517). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to access S3 using temporary credentials (from STS), users must supply a session token in addition to the usual access key and secret key. \r\n\r\nHowever, currently, the S3FileSystem class only accepts access_key and secret_key arguments.  The only workaround is to provide the session token as an environment variable, but this not ideal for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nThis is a request to allow an optional session_token argument when initializing the S3FileSystem.\r\n\r\n",
