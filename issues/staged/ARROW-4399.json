        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4399](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4399). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe aren't using this to any benefit right now (only the simple constructor is being instantiated once, everything else in inline), and the rules about template visibility and linkage vary a lot between compilers, as evidenced by patches such as https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3503\r\n\r\nIn general I think we should try not to use \"extern template class\" at all in the codebase for the problems that come with it",
