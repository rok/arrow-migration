Is there any use case where it is used to represent strings for which the substring kernels make sense? Well, maybe there is an application that uses fixed size strings for some data. Based on this, then all the other string kernels in [ARROW-13879](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13879) also need to be updated to support **FixedSizeBinaryTypes**."

Nevertheless, in the software community the terms binary strings are common, so it would be difficult to provide a consistent nomenclature."
