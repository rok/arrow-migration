Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently there is not really a high-level landing page for Arrow Flight on the Arrow site. The closest thing is the\u00a0[Arrow Flight RPC](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) page under **Specifications and Protocols**\u00a0but that page does not really explain the \"why\" and quickly gets into technical details. Should we consider adding a new **Arrow Flight** page under {**}Subprojects{**}? We could populate the page with some content from the Arrow Flight and Arrow Flight SQL blog posts.",

That could be an opportunity to also highlight things like the contributors guide, cookbook, and so on."
