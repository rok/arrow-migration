        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9750](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9750). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRecent changes in 1.0.0 affected the way pyarrow.Array\u00a0 scalars handle operations such as equality. For example, an equality check will compare object equivalence and return False no matter what the value is. Since this could be confusing to the user, there should be some documentation on this behavior.",
