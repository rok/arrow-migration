Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOriginally mentioned in:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/6243>\r\n\r\nHigh level description:\r\n \\* As of [this commit](https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/df54da211448b5202aa08ed2b245eb78cfd1e50c)\u00a0support to supply a Schema to ConvertOptions in the csv module module was added (I'll add, extremely useful!). Marked as affected in at least 0.12.0 based on the commit history, as well as 0.15.1 (I cannot verify anything between but would assume it is true over the whole version range).\r\n \\* As of 0.15.1 the [published documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.csv.ConvertOptions.html#pyarrow.csv.ConvertOptions) only explains that a dictionary from field name to DataType can be supplied.\r\n\r\nMinimal reproduction: N/A, see link.",

I am just coming back to this and will also respond to comments on the other two issues I filed. I need to get a build environment set up so I can generate the docs/check them out but hopefully will have a PR for this end of week (quick minor change, but I'm still just familiarizing myself with the project layout/build)."
