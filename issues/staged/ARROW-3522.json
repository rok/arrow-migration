        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3522](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3522). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI would request removing `-Wconversion` from the CI build flags. It is overly finicky, generating errors for things such as converting a `size_t` to `double`. Furthermore, `gbenchmark` fails building with it, making it difficult to exercise locally.\r\n\r\nI will mention that MSVC's conversion warnings are vastly more reasonable.",
