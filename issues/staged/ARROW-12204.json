        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12204](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12204). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n1. Rationale\n   \n   The [integration test](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9884/checks?check_run_id=2263730460) has a fixed size builder docker image and has builds from several Arrow implementations.\n   \n   The Rust build artifacts (compiled binaries) in the integration tests still consume ~ 1GB of space even after https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9879 (see `[~apitrou]`'s comment on  https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9884#issuecomment-813037756).\n   \n   It would be nice to reduce this even more (and speed up integration test while we are at it)",
