        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16135](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16135). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe gRPC Flight tests trigger lots of TSAN errors and the UCX Flight tests segfault inside UCX when TSAN is enabled. [This gRPC issue](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/16749) is quite old, but suggests we need to build gRPC itself with TSAN. We should investigate these cases.",
