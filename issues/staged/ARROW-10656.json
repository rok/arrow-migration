        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10656](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10656). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen instanciating a new RecordBatch with `try_new()`, the data types of columns are checked to match their corresponding fields in the schema with `==`.\u00a0The `==` operator will consider all attribues of the two data types and compare strictly if all values are equal.\u00a0However, a code comment above this comparison indicates _[1]_:\r\n\r\n<q>\u00a0list types can have different names, but we only need the data types to be the same</q>\r\n\r\nSince\u00a0ARROW-10261\u00a0([PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8608)) was merged lists contain a `Field` instead of just a `DataType`. Therefore, the values of this field are striclty compared. This behavior contradicts the comment.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe data type comparison in `try_new()` should be changed into only matching data types, including the nested ones, but leaving out other values.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n_[1] src/record_batch.rs:103_",
