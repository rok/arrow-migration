Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe minmax compute function returns a struct with fields \"min\" and \"max\". So to write an R binding for the `min()` method on arrow objects, I call \"minmax\" and then take the \"min\" field from the result. However, at least from my reading of scalar.h compared with array_nested.h, there are no field/GetFieldByName/etc. methods for StructScalar, so I can't get it.",
