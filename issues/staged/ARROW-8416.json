Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI don't know what the plans are on the C++ side (ARROW-7586), but for 0.17, I think it would be nice if we can at least support `ds.dataset(..., format=\"feather\")` (instead of needing to tell people to do `ds.dataset(..., format=\"ipc\")` to read feather files).",
