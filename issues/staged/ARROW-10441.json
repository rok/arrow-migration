        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10441](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10441). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems there may be a mistake in the Java FlightClient where it's possible to create multiple FlightClients from a single ManagedChannel.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/flight/flight-grpc/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/flight/FlightGrpcUtils.java#L55>\u00a0which lets you specify the channel. However, if you do create multiple FlightClients from a single channel, then calling close() (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/flight/flight-core/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/flight/FlightClient.java#L503) on a single FlightClient will close the channel for all of the FlightClients that share that channel, which seems incorrect.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the FlightGrpcUtils was intended only for testing purposes and this should never happen in practice. A few possible options would be to:\r\n \\* This behaviour is intended, no action.\r\n \\* Track if a channel is used by multiple clients and only close on the last client to close.\r\n \\* Disallow creation of a FlightClient with a specified ManagedChannel.",

I'm not sure why this is the case, but it does make using FlightClient slightly easier + Flight by itself tries not to directly expose gRPC as there are hopes for alternate transports in the future.\r\n\r\nOne workaround here would be to implement a proxy ManagedChannel that delegates to the real channel but makes closing a no-op."
