Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed in the ML (https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r19aad8a34f63334d3fcd627106f69be13f689740b83930a4eecc17b3%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E), the current implementation use hard-coded field names. This may cause some problems, for example, when reconstruct a usable schema from a list of FieldVectors.\r\n\r\nSo we resolve this problem by allowing NullVectors to have distinct field names. \r\n\r\nThis also makes the NullVector consistent with other types of vectors.",
