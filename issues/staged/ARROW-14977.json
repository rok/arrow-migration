Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo create a guide tutorial for a simple Python feature I will add a made-up function to `compute.py` in order to demonstrate the process of making a first contribution.\r\n\r\nThe function will call `min_max` and increase the interval for 1 in both directions. I would call the new function `tutorial_example`.",
