        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2046](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2046). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `pyarrow` doesn't seem to support reading from `pathlib.Path` or similar objects. [PEP519](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0519/) introduced `__fspath__` which could be used to transform any `Path` like object to a string.\r\n\r\n[Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/a9d8e04ab68f688f899b4164bfa1ac868c9c1c64/pandas/io/common.py#L120-L160) has a sample implementation, though I think a simpler implementation of it could be used.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pathlib\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\r\n 'Foo': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C'],\r\n 'Bar': ['A1', 'A2', 'B2', 'D3', ''],\r\n})\r\n\r\ntest_dir = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / 'test'\r\ntest_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\npath = test_dir / 'file1.parquet'\r\n\r\n# Doesn't work\r\npq.write_table(table, path)\r\n\r\n# Works\r\npq.write_table(table, str(path))\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/1522>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
