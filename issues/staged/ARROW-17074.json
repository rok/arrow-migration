Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA simple function has been added for merging elements of a hash table into another. At the moment, a warning is logged if this fails; presumably, the elements have already been added to a hash table so the risk should be low.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt some point, we should improve this error handling:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13583#issuecomment-1184460378",
