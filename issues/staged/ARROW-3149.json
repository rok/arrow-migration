Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ngRPC is not available in conda-forge yet. It has a rather complex dependency chain if you want secure RPCs (e.g. Google is maintaining a fork of OpenSSL, BoringSSL). Some of these dependencies will have to be added to conda-forge in turn.",

The vendoring situation with gRPC makes things pretty complicated \u2013 the CMake build for example installs all of the transitive dependencies. It seems that the patch here is intended to undo this logic; there may be some other way to avoid installing the vendored dependencies without having to patch the CMakeLists.txt (which could grow unmaintainable)"
