Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGetting access to hdfs via libhdfs requires the setting of several environment variables. \nMany of these paths should be auto-detectable requiring less or perhaps even no information from the user. This would lower the access barrier to hdfs for a non-dev user.",
