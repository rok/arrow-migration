        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4465](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4465). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a user, I would like to be able to specify an ORDER BY clause on my query.\r\n\r\nWork involved:\r\n \\* Add OrderBy to LogicalPlan enum\r\n \\* Write query planner code to translate SQL AST to OrderBy (SQL parser that we use already supports parsing ORDER BY)\r\n \\* Implement SortRelation\r\n\r\nMy high level thoughts on implementing the SortRelation:\r\n \\* Create Arrow array of uint32 same size as batch and populate such that each element contains its own index i.e. array will be 0, 1, 2, 3....\r\n \\* Find a Rust crate for sorting that allows us to provide our own comparison lambda\r\n \\* Implement the comparison logic (probably can reuse existing execution code - see filter.rs for how it implements comparison expressions)\r\n \\* Use index array to store the result of the sort i.e. no need to rewrite the whole batch, just the index\r\n \\* Rewrite the batch after the sort has completed\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to see how Gandiva has implemented this\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
