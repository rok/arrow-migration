Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```\nenum UnionMode:int { Sparse, Dense }\n\ntable Union {\n  mode: UnionMode;\n  typeIds: [Int32]; // optional, describes typeid of each child.\n}\n```\nThe idea is to enable providing an id different from the child offset (the default)\nThis enables an optimization where we use predefined ids when constructing the type vector of the union but want the children to be only the actually used types.\n",

That makes sense to me."

(typeIds is the same length as the children in the Field)"
