Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`ForeignBuffer` keeps the reference to the Python base object in the Python wrapper class, not in the C++ buffer instance, meaning if the C++ buffer gets passed around but the Python wrapper gets destroyed, the reference to the original Python base object will be released.",
