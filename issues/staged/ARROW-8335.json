        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8335](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8335). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWorkflow: edit version number and rc number in template in `dev/release/github.verify.yml`, make PR, and do \r\n\r\n- `@github-actions crossbow submit -g verify-rc` to run everything\n- `@github-actions crossbow submit -g verify-rc-wheel|source|binary` to run those groups\n- Other groups at `verify-rc-wheel|source-macos|ubuntu|windows`, `verify-rc-source-cpp|csharp|java|etc.`\n- Individual workflows at e.g. `verify-rc-wheel-windows`, `verify-rc-source-macos-csharp`. We could break out the wheel verification by python version (maybe we should), but that requires changes to the verification scripts themselves.\n  \n  Running the main `verify-rc` group will put a ton of workflow svg badges on the PR so we can see at a glance what is passing and failing. If things fail when running all, can push fixes to the verification script to the branch and retry just those that failed.",
