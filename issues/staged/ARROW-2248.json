Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe continue to acquire more functionality related to HDFS and Parquet. Testing this, including tests that involve interoperability with other systems, like Spark, will require some work outside of our normal CI infrastructure.\r\n\r\nI suggest we start with testing the C++/Python HDFS integration, which will help with validating patches like ARROW-1643 https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1668",
