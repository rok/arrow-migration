        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16892](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16892). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe created yesterday a new version 10.0.0 on Jira but the merge script started suggesting the wrong version:\r\n```java\n\r\nEnter comma-separated fix version(s) [10.0.0]:   \n```\r\nThe version has been temporarily removed from Jira to avoid mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe problem is on the sorting we do on the merge_script when selecting the version:\r\n```java\n\r\nunreleased_versions = sorted(unreleased_versions,\r\n                                     key=lambda x: x.name, reverse=True) \n```\r\nOnce the fix is in place we can create the Version 10.0.0 again on JIRA",
