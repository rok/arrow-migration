Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nsee discussion in ARROW-1474\r\n\r\nMy plan is to separate the stylecheck fixes into manageable chunks so they are easier to review.  I'll do this by enabling the build to fail on style, then suppressing all checks but the ones to be fixed.",
