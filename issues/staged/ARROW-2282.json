Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile we will add a more general-purpose functionality in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2281, the interface is more complicate then the constructor that explicitly states all arguments:\u00a0 `StringArray(int64_t length, const std::shared_ptr<Buffer>& value_offsets, \u2026`\r\n\r\nThus I will also expose this explicit constructor.",
