Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI found that generators are generally slower than iterators in most browsers. See [https://observablehq.com/@domoritz/yield-vs-iterator-vs-callback](https://observablehq.com/@domoritz/yield-vs-iterator-vs-callback). I attached the results for Chrome. We should consider using iterators instead of generators for iterating over row proxies and vectors.\u00a0",
