        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11680](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11680). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRationale for vendoring:\r\n\r\nFolly contains hundreds of files, requires boost & C++14.\u00a0 The ProducerConsumerQueue class could be extracted out of three of those files and hasn't been changed since 2018.\u00a0 The queue does not appear to have any open issues.\r\n\r\nComparisons with alternatives:\r\n\r\nI have included a benchmark comparing folly with boost (since boost::lockfree::spsc_queue is already included in arrow, I think).\u00a0 Boost does not support a move workflow for spsc_queue and performs worse.\r\n\r\nI have not compared with any other alternatives but the utility is small and straightforward enough I am doubtful there would be significant differences.",
