It is free for public OSS repos:\r\n\r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/\r\n\r\nThe only reason I suggest it is because it has some really nice built-in capabilities for C# - especially building solutions/projects and reporting xunit test results. To be fair, I've never used Appveyor myself, so I\u00a0don't know how easy it is in that system."
