Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\narrow is available as a port in vcpkg, a C++ library manager that simplifies installation for arrow and other project dependencies. Documenting the install process here will help users get started by providing a single set of commands to build arrow, ready to be included in their projects.\r\n\r\nWe also test whether our library ports build in various configurations (dynamic, static) on various platforms (OSX, Linux, Windows: x86, x64, UWP, ARM) to keep a wide coverage for users.\r\n\r\nI'm a maintainer for vcpkg, and\u00a0[here is what the port script looks like](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/arrow/portfile.cmake). We try to keep the library maintained as close as possible to the original library.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI already have a PR to add docs:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6252>",
