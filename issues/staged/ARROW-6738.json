Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are some problems with the current union comparison logic. For example:\r\n 1. For type check, we should not require fields to be equal. It is possible that two vectors' value ranges are equal but their fields are different.",
