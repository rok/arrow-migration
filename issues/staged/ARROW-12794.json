Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nread_parquet freezes R completely when I run it a modest number of times. I thought it might have been something in the imported data but the fully new reprex included as an attachment below has the same problem.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have tried this on two different computers and the result is the same.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOn the example below the session froze at loop 117 and loop 609 in the most recent test.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
