Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, PyArrow and ArrowCpp need to be provided the region of the S3 file/bucket, else it defaults to using 'us-east-1'. Ideally, PyArrow and ArrowCpp can automatically detect the region and get the files, etc. For instance, s3fs and boto3 can read and write files without having to specify the region explicitly. Similar functionality to auto-detect the region would be great to have in PyArrow and ArrowCpp.",
