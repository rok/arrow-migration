Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nListing files on S3 is slow due to the recursive nature of the algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe following change modifies the behavior of the S3Result to include all objects but no \"grouping\" (directories). This lower dramatically the number of HTTP calls. \r\n```c++\n\r\ndiff --git a/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.cc b/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.cc\r\nindex 70c87f46ec..98a40b17a2 100644\r\n--- a/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.cc\r\n+++ b/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.cc\r\n@@ -986,7 +986,7 @@ class S3FileSystem::Impl {\r\n     if (!prefix.empty()) {\r\n       req.SetPrefix(ToAwsString(prefix) + kSep);\r\n     }\r\n-    req.SetDelimiter(Aws::String() + kSep);\r\n+    // req.SetDelimiter(Aws::String() + kSep);\r\n     req.SetMaxKeys(kListObjectsMaxKeys);\r\n \r\n     while (true) {\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe suggested change is to add an option to Selector, e.g. `no_directory_result` or something like this.\r\n",
