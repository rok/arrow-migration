Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe merge_pr script on the arrow-site repository is still using the old merge workflow. Closing PRs and not using the GITHUB_TOKEN.\r\n\r\nWe probably should update the script to use the same workflow we use on the main arrow repository.\r\n\r\nThis was raised when merging this PR <https://github.com/apache/arrow-site/pull/225>\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
