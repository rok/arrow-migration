Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI discovered this issue using a row's `toJSON()` function. The problem is here: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/fc1d7d44317b20f899928755b05a774715f27ce8/js/src/vector/row.ts#L195>\r\n\r\nWhen `field.name` is \"size\", `this[\"size\"]` will return the value of the size property on the Row instead of the value of the column. I fixed it locally by changing the values function to:\r\n```java\n\r\npublic *values() {\r\n    for (const field of this[kParent].type.children) {\r\n        yield (this as RowLike<T>)[this[kKeyToIdx].get(field.name)];\r\n    }\r\n}\n```\r\n\u00a0",
