Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs part of this refactor, the FileSystem-related classes in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/io/interfaces.h#L51 should be removed. The files should probably be moved also to arrow/filesystem",

It carries more information than fs::FileStats: last access time in addition to last modified time (though in seconds rather than ns since the epoch), block size, replication, and permissions. io-hdfs.pxi passes all of this for `some_hdfs.ls(some_path, detail=True)` but the docstring does not provide specifics about what metadata is guaranteed and test_hdfs.py doesn't even call `ls(... detail=True)`"

The new HDFS implementation still calls into the old one. It would be a welcome cleanup job to reintegrate all the HDFS filesystem code into `arrow/filesystem/hdfs.cc`, but rather low-priority."
