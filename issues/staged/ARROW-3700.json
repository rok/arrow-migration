        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3700](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3700). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a copy/paste of the github issue: https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2883\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI was playing with `pyarrow.csv` `read_csv` and found a rather strange behavior that I'm not sure is normal.\r\n\r\nParsing will fail if the delimiter of the CSV file is a comma and there's a blank line after the header (see `basic_with_blank.csv` example)\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n\r\n`{{Traceback (most recent call last): File \"sorrow.py\", line 14, in <module> table = pa_csv.read_csv(csv) File \"pyarrow/_csv.pyx\", line 198, in pyarrow._csv.read_csv File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 81, in pyarrow.lib.check_status pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: CSV parse error: Expected 2 columns, got 1 `}}\r\n\r\nIf I change the CSV delimiter to semicolon, the error disappears and everything is fine!\r\n\r\nI'm providing python code and CSV samples which compares with pandas (which does not suffer from this).\r\n\r\nHope this helps, thanks",
