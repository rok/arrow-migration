Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe ['packaging' section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apache-arrow#packaging)\u00a0on the Arrow NPM page lists a standalone package targeting typescript.\r\n\r\nBut it seems \"@apache-arrow/ts\" is missing content. As an example, Arrow.dom.ts has imports that are missing after installation. \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport streamAdapters from './io/adapters';\r\nimport { Builder } from './builder/index';\r\n... etc ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstalling the \"apache-arrow\" package seems to works fine. \r\n",
