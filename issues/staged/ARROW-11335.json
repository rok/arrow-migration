Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the C++ JSON table reader does not support the Arrow FixedSizeList type.\r\n\r\nWhen the Arrow schema is not inferred but supplied to the parser, it should attempt to turn JSON arrays into an Arrow FixedSizeList if the schema dictates this for specific fields.\r\n\r\nThis currently results in the JSON table reader returning an error, e.g.:\r\n```java\n\r\nJSON conversion to fixed_size_list<item: uint64 not null>[12] is not supported\n```",
