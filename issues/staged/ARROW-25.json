Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLike Parquet and binary file formats, text files will be an important data medium for converting to and from in-memory Arrow data. \n\npandas has some (Apache-compatible) business logic we can learn from here (as one of the gold-standard CSV readers in production use)\n\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/src/parser/tokenizer.h\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/parser.pyx\n\nWhile very fast, this this should be largely written from scratch to target the Arrow memory layout, but we can reuse certain aspects like the tokenizer DFA (which originally came from the Python interpreter csv module implementation)\n\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/src/parser/tokenizer.c#L713",
