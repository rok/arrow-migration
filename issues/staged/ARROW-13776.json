        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13776](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13776). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe file `cpp/thirdparty/versions.txt` lists third-party dependencies, and the filename `download_dependencies.sh` should use to save them.\r\nA couple of those files, for `aws-checksums` and `aws-c-event-stream`, are missing extensions.\r\nWhen I try to use those files, e.g. with `$ARROW_AWS_CHECKSUMS_URL`, cmake has an error:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nCMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/ExternalProject.cmake:1561 (message):\r\n  error: do not know how to extract\r\n  '/tmp/RtmpuzmuVM/R.INSTALL3f194a9055a6/arrow/arrow-thirdparty/aws-c-event-stream-v0.1.5'\r\n  -- known types are .7z, .tar, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz, .tar.xz, .tbz2, .tgz, .txz\r\n  and .zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error is fixed if I manually add `.tar.gz` to `aws-checksums-v0.1.10` and `aws-c-event-stream-v0.1.5`.",
