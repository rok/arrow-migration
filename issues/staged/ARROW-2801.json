Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the split_row_groups argument in ParquetDataset yields a not implemented error. An easy and efficient way to implement this is by using the summary metadata file instead of\u00a0opening every footer file",
