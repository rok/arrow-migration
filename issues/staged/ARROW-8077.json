Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBecause conda-forge isn't building Python 3.5 packages anymore we need to build the 3.5 wheel in a different way, with most C++ dependencies built in BUNDLED mode. For this build we can disable Gandiva and Flight to keep things simple",
