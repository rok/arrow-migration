        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13943](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13943). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThese functions have been specifically forbidden from being called by python.  An attempt to do so will yield:\r\n\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowNotImplementedError: Direct execution of HASH_AGGREGATE functions\r\n\r\nThe functions should not show up in pc.list_functions at all and pc.get_function should return None if given 'hash_sum'.  Perhaps they could be stored in a different registry?  Or, since we are special casing them anyways, special case them in some way they can be hidden?",
