Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMany scalar string kernels only use ASCII characters in their tests. This should be extended to other UTF-8 codepoints for move coverage.\r\nThis will most likely require changing the **TYPED_TEST_SUITE** used in those tests to only consider _[Large]StringType_.",
