Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe inlined assertion is prone to fail and panic when a user of the method passes anything other than 0..7 range. This is making wrong usages to crash the application that uses Arrow.",
