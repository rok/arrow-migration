Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow C++ library has `tdigest` and `hash_tdigest` kernels that return arrays/lists. We call these from bindings with `q = 0.5` to find the approximate median, but the output is difficult to work with. It would be nice to create kernels wrapping these that would produce scalar output per array/group:\r\n\r\n`appx_median` -->\u00a0`tdigest(q = 0.5)`\r\n\r\n`hash_appx_median` --> `hash_tdigest(q = 0.5)`",
