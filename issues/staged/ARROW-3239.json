Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur various code for generating random datasets for testing and benchmarks is a bit verbose / awkward.\r\n\r\nI suggest defining a nicer API so we can write code like:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nauto arr = random::int32(length, seed);\r\nauto arr = random::varbinary(length, max_value_size, seed);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this is only for test code, we can abort if anything returns error Status to make the API more convenient",
