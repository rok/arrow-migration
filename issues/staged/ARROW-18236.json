        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18236](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18236). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was trying to solve a user issue today and tried to run the following code:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\ndf = tibble(x = c(\"a\",\"b\",  \"\"  , \"d\"))\r\nwrite_tsv(df, \"data.tsv\")\r\nopen_dataset(\"data.tsv\", format=\"tsv\", skip_rows=1, schema=schema(x=string()), skip_empty_rows = TRUE) %>%\r\n  collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n which gives me the error\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nError: Use either Arrow parse options or readr parse options, not both\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is somewhat obnoxious as I have literally no context provided to know which options are being referred to and what the possible options are.\r\n\r\nAlso, like, why can't we have a mix of both? This is a totally valid use-case.  I think both a code update and a more informative error message are needed here.\r\n",
