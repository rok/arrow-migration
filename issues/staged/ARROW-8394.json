Types of property 'new' are incompatible.\r\n\r\n**node_modules/@apache-arrow/es2015-esm/ipc/reader.d.ts:238:5** - error TS2717: Subsequent property declarations must have the same type. Property 'schema' must be of type 'Schema', but here has type 'Schema'.\r\n\r\n238 schema: Schema;\r\n\r\n**node_modules/@apache-arrow/es2015-esm/recordbatch.d.ts:17:18** - error TS2430: Interface 'RecordBatch' incorrectly extends interface 'StructVector'. The types of 'slice(...).clone' are incompatible between these types.\r\n\r\nthe tsconfig.json file looks like\r\n\r\n{\r\n \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n \"target\":\"ES6\",\r\n \"outDir\": \"dist\",\r\n \"baseUrl\": \"src/\"\r\n },\r\n \"exclude\": [\"dist\"],\r\n \"include\": [\"src/\\*.ts\"]\r\n}",

A couple of cases I've found that are invalid:\u00a0\n   1. Extension of static `new()` methods with different typed parameter order (column<T> derived from chunked<T> but changes the signature of `new` to takes `string | Field` as the first param over `Data`\n   1. Not passing template types to fields (e.g. `foo: Schema` to `foo: Schema<T>`)\u00a0\n1. Attempting to upgrade `apache-arrow` to typescript@3.8 (or 3.9-beta) falls afoul of a typescript compiler bug (<https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/35186>); from my understanding, the compiler is on an error path anyway but bails when trying to print error detail. This makes the upgrade difficult as it's a case of whack-a-mole.\u00a0"

I had to do a bunch of weird things to trick the 3.5 compiler into propagating the types, so I'm hoping I can back some of those out to get it working in 3.9 and simplify the typedefs along the way."
