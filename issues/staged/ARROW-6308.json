        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6308](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6308). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer discussions in the following threads, as spec(<http://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/IPC.html#streaming-format>) described, as long as a record batch doesn't reference a dictionary they can be interleaved.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4960>\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5146>\r\n\r\nCurrently it\u2019s able to parse dictionaries and batches which are interleaved via ARROW-6040,\u00a0 But it\u2019s impossible to write data in this format.\r\n\r\ncases below should be supported:\r\n\r\ni. have a record batch of one dictionary encoded column S\r\n1. Schema\n1. RecordBatch: S=[null, null, null, null]\n1. DictionaryBatch: ['abc', 'efg']\n1. Recordbatch: S=[0, 1, 0, 1]\n   \n   ii. have a record batch of two dictionary encoded column S1, S2\n1. Schema\n1. DictionaryBatch S1: ['ab', 'cd']\n1. RecordBatch: S1 = [0,1,0,1] S2 =[null, null, null,]\n1. DictionaryBatch S2: ['cc', 'dd']\n1. RecordBatch: S1 = [0,1,0,1] S2 =[0,1,0,1]\n   \n   This issue is used to record this problem, and should be done after a ML discuss.",

A dictionary-encoded field would have to have all null values. Let's discuss further on the mailing list"
