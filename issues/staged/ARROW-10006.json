        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10006](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10006). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen converting python objects to arrow array currently we always collect the input to a sequence, but this may be memory consuming in certain cases. \r\n\r\nFor unknown sized iterators we could consume and temporarily store the seen items during inference potentially improving both the conversion time and peak memory usage.
