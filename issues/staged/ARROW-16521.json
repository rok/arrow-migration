        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16521](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16521). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIs it possible for the user to increase the timeout allowed on the curl settings when accessing S3 records?\u00a0 The default setting appears to be more aggressive than most other S3 clients I use, which means that I see a lot more failures on arrow-based operations than the other clients see.\u00a0 I'm not seeing how this can be increased though?",
