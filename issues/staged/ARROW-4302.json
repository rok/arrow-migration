Parquet files have become one of the world's most important open source data warehousing formats; having column-level encryption was an inevitable requirement. "

I'm developing the parquet encryption module in C++, but lack of Cmake experience. I will appreciate if someone can help me add OpenSSL as Cmake flexible module, just like boost or other third-party modules of parquet. Thanks!"

We have some experience with this from the Libhdfs++ project. Do you want to share your code first in a PR? We can then add support for OpenSSL."
