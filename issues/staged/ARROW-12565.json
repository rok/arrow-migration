Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-11990 refines kernel error handling. Most kernels performance are not affected. Scalar arithmetic kernels are improved. But some filter kernel performance drops after the refinement. There may be something deserves deeper investigation.",
