Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDense union type is not supported yet in Parquet <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/8e43f23dcc6a9e630516228f110c48b64d13cec6/cpp/src/parquet/arrow/schema.cc#L382>\u00a0. Is it on schedule to support it nearly? If I'd implement this myself, is there any other codes to take care of? Thanks.",

(and based on the ARROW:schema metadata, we could restore the sparse union type on reading) \r\nBut I don't think something similar is possible for _dense_ union? (since that consists of variable-size child arrays) "

For the value offsets data in sparse union array, do you think it's doable to save it in level info and read it back when building the sparse array data?\r\n\u00a0"
