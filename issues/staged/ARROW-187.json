Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently have code sprinkled around constructors that can technically fail because we either do a memcpy/allocation via vector copy constructor (we might be using a move constructor in places) and make_shared<>.\n\nThese are very small memory allocations but they can throw std::bad_alloc.\n\nTechnically, we would need to convert these to use Init or static factories.\n\n(types.h is one place to look)",

I don't have enough experience to know how real the risk is, but it definitely safer to avoid expensive allocations in the constructor (via static factory + Init method)."

I say \"should\" because it seems very likely that if the allocations on these small amounts fail, something in the system would likely fail soon afterwards anyways.  \n\nBut at least it wouldn't be Arrow causing the segfault.   \n\nI don't have much experience here either.  Most of my C++ work has been done assuming exceptions.   I was going to send out an e-mail to the mailing list to see if I could get more of a response."

This is the pattern we currently use in the code base.  I will update documentation to reflect this and then close this issue."
