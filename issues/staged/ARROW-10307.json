        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10307](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10307). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe aim of this issue is to discuss and try to implement async in the Parquet crate for read traits.\r\n\r\nIt focuses on the read part to limit the complexity and impact of the changes. The design choices should also make sense for the write part.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n[ARROW-9275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9275) is a more generic and abstract discussion about async. This issue focuses on Parquet read\r\n\r\n[ARROW-9464](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9464) focuses on threading in datafusion but overlaps with this issue when datafusion reads from parquet\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
