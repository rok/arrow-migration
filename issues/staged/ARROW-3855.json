Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nJSON serde is already implemented but in a non-standard way which prevents referencing Arrow types from structs that implement the serde Serialization/Deserialization traits.\r\n\r\nWe should refactor this code so that the Arrow types implement custom serialization. See <https://serde.rs/custom-serialization.html> for more information.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
