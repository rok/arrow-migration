        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9783](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9783). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen constructing a logical plan either directly or via the DataFrame API, it is not possible to construct an aggregate expression without providing a data type. This makes no sense because the aggregate functions need to determine their own data type.",
