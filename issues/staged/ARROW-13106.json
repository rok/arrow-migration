        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13106](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13106). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImplement a string formatting kernel. There are several possible designs we could consider for this:\r\n- a variadic kernel that works like\u00a0[`fmt::format`](https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html) or [`std::format` in C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format) (probably the best option)\n- something more similar to Python [`str.format`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax)\n- something more like C++ [`printf`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fprintf)",
