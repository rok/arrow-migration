        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13852](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13852). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10992#issuecomment-910598194. Scanner would preserve the schema metadata but ExecPlan does not, and that makes sense in the general case. But this may result in unexpected behavior in R where we keep R attributes in the schema metadata. \r\n\r\nWe could probably determine in ExecPlan$Build which fields in the resulting Table are just carried forward from the underlying Dataset and pull in metadata for them to the result.",
