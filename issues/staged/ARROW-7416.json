        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7416](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7416). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe nightly build started failing when R 3.6.2 came out. I\u2019ve done some digging and debugging.\r\n\r\nHere is the install log from the failure on 3.6.2: https://dl.bintray.com/ursalabs/arrow-r/logs/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6/20191216-00install.out\r\n\r\nHere is the log from success on 3.6.0: https://dl.bintray.com/ursalabs/arrow-r/logs/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6/20191217-00install.out\r\n\r\nOn 3.6.2, there\u2019s a longer temp dir path, with \u201cworking_dir\u201d in it. I traced that to this change: https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/956ea7f7d4db25ad6a2fb32f177e9ec5995d350d\r\nWhen it fails, there\u2019s a bunch of \u201cNote: The post-install step did not complete successfully\u201d messages, and then later \u201cError: too long unix socket path (123bytes given but 104bytes max)\u201c. Which makes me think that the extra `/Rtmpyp98FZ/working_dir/` temp path is pushing us over some limit?",
