Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile working on ARROW-6337, I saw that .Rhistory files are not currently ignored in Arrow's .gitignore. They serve no purpose to the project so I think they should probably be ignored.",
