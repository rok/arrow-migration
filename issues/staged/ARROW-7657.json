Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee ARROW-7639. R factor \"levels\" must be strings, but dictionary \"values\" aren't restricted like that. Provide an option to govern how dictionary arrays with non-string \"values\" are converted to R: keep the dictionary encoding by making the R vector be type factor and coerce the dictionary values to strings, or keep the dictionary values the type they are and generate an R vector of that type, dropping the dictionary encoding.",
