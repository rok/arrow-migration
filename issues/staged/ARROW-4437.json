        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4437](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4437). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is no\u00a0[Array Builder](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/builder.html#_CPPv3N5arrow12ArrayBuilderE)\u00a0API in python bindings. When I generate data from a stream, I have to build a python list (high overhead) or pandas,\u00a0then\u00a0finalize it by call pa.array with copy operation. It seems like that we can build an Array directly from some (two or three) pa.ResizableBuffer in O(1) time.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that maintain these buffers (value buffer, null bitmap, offset buffer) manually by current exported API, but not safe enough.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI found undocumented StringBuilder API in [python/pyarrow/builder.pxi](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/builder.pxi), corresponding to <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/builder.html#classarrow_1_1_string_builder>. Will other ArrayBuilder APIs to be add in python binding?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\nSomething more\r\n\r\na BatchBuilder API is better if possible.",

This is a really good beginner task. Would you like to have some guidance on how to expose them?"
