Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n_Adding this as a separate task as it's a bit involved._\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to read in JSON structs that are children of the JSON record being read.\r\nThe main concern here is deeply nested structures, which will require a performant and reusable basic JSON reader before dealing with recursion.",
