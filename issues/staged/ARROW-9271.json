Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-8899 collects R attributes from the columns of a data.frame (including recursively in data frame columns), adds them to arrow schema metadata, and restores them when pulling a data frame into R. However, any attributes on the outer data frame itself are not preserved. These are lost in some autosplice magic code before `AddMetadataFromDots` can collect it.",
