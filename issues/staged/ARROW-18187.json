        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18187](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18187). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-18025 is a work in progress to expose Backpressure handling to Python API. While working on options, found out that the python program doesn't exit or return an error when invalid backpressure options are passed when the output is not a RecordBatchReader or the PyTest raise is used to validate expected errors.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, if the `output_type` is set to `Table`, the observations is the same.\r\n\r\nSeems like this is out of scope of the ARROW-18025 effort and creating this ticket to tackle the problem.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWay to reproduce,\u00a0\r\n\r\nCreate a test case with invalid Backpressure options and set `output_type=Table`\r\n\r\nEdited:\r\n\r\nMake sure to remove the Python validation logic (backpressure validation) in `_substrait.pyx`.",
