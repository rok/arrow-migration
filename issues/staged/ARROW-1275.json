Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[~Max Risuhin] can you take a look at this? Currently this is hard-coded at \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake#L503\n\nbut in the new conda-forge Windows package (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/snappy/1.1.6/download/win-64/snappy-1.1.6-vc14_1.tar.bz2), it is `snappy_static.lib`, which is more consistent with the other packages. We should change our vendored `SnappyCMakeLists.txt` to use that name. Also, we should utilize the CMake configuration variable for the static library suffix",
