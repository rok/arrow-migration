Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently negative integers are explicitly forbidding in the `Take` kernel. It would be nice to have the option to treat negative integers as NULL instead.",

I am not fully sure this is something that belongs in Arrow? (of course, doing it on the pandas side will not be as efficient, as we first need to pre-process the integer indices to convert -1 to null)"
