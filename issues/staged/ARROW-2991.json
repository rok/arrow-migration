Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAppVeyor builds all jobs serially so it's important not to have too many of them to avoid builds taking too much time and queuing up.\r\n\r\nI suggest to remove the following jobs:\r\n- the Release build with Ninja and VS2015; we already have both a Release build with Ninja and VS2017, and a Debug build with Ninja and VS2015\n- the two NMake builds: we already exercise the Ninja (cross-platform, fastest) and Visual Studio (standard under Windows) build chains\n  \n  [~Max Risuhin] you added some of those jobs, do you have any concerns?\n",
