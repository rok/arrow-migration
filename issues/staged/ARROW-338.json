Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe logic for obtaining buffers and metaata from each array is currently somewhat self-contained in `arrow/ipc/adapter.cc` \u2013 this is somewhat inflexible. See the interface used in the Java implementation: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/FieldVector.java#L52\n\nThis may be better implemented using virtual functions and the visitor pattern, which may yield better user-extensibility in the future",
