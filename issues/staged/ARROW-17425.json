Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince the current unit is fixed to \"s\", an error will occur if a time containing sub-seconds is given.\r\n```r\n\r\n\"1970-01-01T00:00:59.123456789\" |>\r\n  arrow::arrow_table(x = _) |>\r\n  dplyr::mutate(x = lubridate::as_datetime(x, tz = \"UTC\")) |>\r\n  dplyr::collect()\r\n#> Error in `dplyr::collect()`:\r\n#> ! Invalid: Failed to parse string: '1970-01-01T00:00:59.123456789' as a scalar of type timestamp[s]\r\n```\r\nI thought that nanoseconds should be used, but it should be noted that POSIXct is currently supposed to be converted to microseconds, as shown in ARROW-17424.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
