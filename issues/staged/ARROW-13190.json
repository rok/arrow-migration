Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current behavior of the **INITCAP**\u00a0function is to turn the first character of each word uppercase and remains the other as is.\r\n\r\nThe desired behavior is to turn the first letter uppercase and the other lowercase. Any character except the alphanumeric ones should be considered as a word separator.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThat behavior is based on these database systems:\r\n \\* [Oracle](<https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions065.htm>)\r\n \\* [Postgres](<https://w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/initcap-function.php)>\r\n \\* [Redshift](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_INITCAP.html)>\r\n \\* [Splice Machine](<https://doc.splicemachine.com/sqlref_builtinfcns_initcap.html>)",
