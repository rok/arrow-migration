Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs mentioned in https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2842/running-pyarrow-on-pypy-segfaults#comment-50670536, we currently access a `PyDataTime_Date` object with a `PyDataTime_DateTime` cast in `PyDateTime_DATE_GET_SECOND` in our code in two instances. While CPython is able to deal with this wrong usage, PyPy is not able to do so. We should separate the path here into one that deals with dates and another that deals with datetimes.\r\n\r\nReproducible code:\r\n```java\n\r\npa.array([datetime.date(2018, 5, 10)], type=pa.date64())\n```",
