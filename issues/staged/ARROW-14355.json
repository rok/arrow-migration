Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis will simply sum up all of the buffers.  It will overestimate in a few cases:\r\n\r\n \\* If there are offsets it will overestimate\r\n \\* If there are shared buffers it will overestimate\r\n\r\nIt only measures the size of the buffers and will not consider the control data (e.g. the C objects wrapping the data) or, specifically for ExecBatch, it will not count scalars.",
