Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the receiver side of flighting, loading validity buffer is an important operation, as each vector has a validity buffer. \r\n\r\nFor non-nullable vectors, the current implementation of loading the validity buffer is inefficient.  We improve the performance of this operation by efficiently setting the bits of a memory region to 1. \r\n\r\nBenchmark results show that the changes leads to a 35% performance improvement:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nBitVectorHelperBenchmarks.loadValidityBufferAllOne  avgt    5  748.916 \u00b1 23.290  ns/op\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nBitVectorHelperBenchmarks.loadValidityBufferAllOne  avgt    5  487.352 \u00b1 15.046  ns/op\r\n",
