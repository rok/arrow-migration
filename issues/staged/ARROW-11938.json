        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11938](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11938). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently,\u00a0`configure.win`\u00a0and\u00a0`tools/winlibs.R`\u00a0have two ways of finding the Arrow C++ library:\r\n1. If\u00a0`RWINLIB_LOCAL`\u00a0is set, it gets it from that zip file\n1. If not, it downloads it\n   \n   Enable and document a third option for the case when the C++ library has been built locally. This will enable R package developers using Windows machines to make changes to code in the C++ library, build and install it, and then build the R package using it.",
