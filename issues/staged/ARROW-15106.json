        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15106](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15106). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs reported at <https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/11932>, the Python Flight server does not allow control over which signals the Flight server will react to, nor does it respect `{}enable_signal_handlers{`}. The latter is a bit pointless - if the server runs on the main thread, there is no way to handle signals in Python - but allowing control over the signals may be more feasible.",
