        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4796](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4796). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPython segfaults if you implement a Flight server that returns a data stream but does not keep a reference to the underlying data source (the Table, RecordBatch, etc). The Flight bindings themselves do not keep a reference to the object, so the server will segfault as the memory has been reclaimed.",
