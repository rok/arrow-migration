        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14021](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14021). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13772 binds `quantile()` to `tdigest()`\u00a0which returns approximate quantiles and binds `median()` to\u00a0`approximate_median()`\u00a0which returns an approximate median. The bindings issue a warning saying that the median/quantile is approximate. Once ARROW-13309 is implemented, modify the binding to call Arrow functions that returns exact quantiles and medians, and\u00a0remove the warnings.\r\n\r\nWe should keep the approximate quantile and median bindings but rename them.\r\n\r\nWhen doing this, we should also modify the bindings to accept `type` and `interpolation` arguments like we do in the `quantile.ArrowDatum` method: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/170a24fc5f9f6f9c7c7d15a716c5995f03204a4b/r/R/compute.R#L156-L187",
