        "title": "[Python] index / unknown columns in specified schema in Table.from_pandas",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5220](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5220). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `Table.from_pandas` method allows to specify a schema (\"This can be used to indicate the type of columns if we cannot infer it automatically.\").\r\n\r\nBut, if you also want to specify the type of the index, you get an error:\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]})\r\ndf.index = pd.Index(['a', 'b', 'c'], name='index')\r\n\r\nmy_schema = pa.schema([('index', pa.string()),\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ('a', pa.int64()),\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ('b', pa.float64()),\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ])\r\n\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df, schema=my_schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\ngives `KeyError: 'index'` (because it tries to look up the \"column names\" from the schema in the dataframe, and thus does not find column 'index').\r\n\r\nThis also has the consequence that re-using the schema does not work: `table1 = pa.Table.from_pandas(df1);  table2 = pa.Table.from_pandas(df2, schema=table1.schema)`\r\n\r\nExtra note: also unknown columns in general give this error (column specified in the schema that are not in the dataframe).\r\n\r\nAt least in pyarrow 0.11, this did not give an error (eg noticed this from the code in example in ARROW-3861). So before, unknown columns in the specified schema were ignored, while now they raise an error. Was this a conscious change?  \r\nSo before also specifying the index in the schema \"worked\" in the sense that it didn't raise an error, but it was also ignored, so didn't actually do what you would expect)\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n- I think that we should support specifying the index in the passed `schema` ? So that the example above works (although this might be complicated with RangeIndex that is not serialized any more)\n- But what to do in general with additional columns in the schema that are not in the DataFrame? Are we fine with keep raising an error as it is now (the error message could be improved then)? Or do we again want to ignore them? (or, it could actually also add them as all nulls to the table)",

See my comment in\u00a0ARROW-3861.\r\n\r\nSecond Question: For me the schema should be the single source of truth. Thus ignoring a column in the schema is no option. I would go with either raise or NULLs. However adding NULLs might be difficult for any non-nullable dtype such as INTs."

Related discussion in ARROW-5427, an option could be to have `preserve_index=True` force a RangeIndex to always be serialized as actual data instead of the default metadata. That could make the expected schema consistent independent of whether your dataframe has a RangeIndex vs Int64Index, and thus easier to match a specified schema."

So assume we start expecting the index also to be present in the schema, if specified:\r\n\r\n- are we OK with erroring if the index is not in the schema but would be written as a column?

In a sense `preserve_index` has the function of informing the final schema. I think if `preserve_index` is None and the index is RangeIndex, then we can respect the schema and write the index as metadata\r\n\r\n> We should follow the order of the columns in the schema, also for the index?
