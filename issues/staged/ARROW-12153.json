        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12153](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12153). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParquet writers like delta-rs rely on the Parquet metadata to write file-level statistics for file pruning purposes.\r\n\r\nWe currently do not expose these stats, requiring the writer to read the file that has just been written, to get the stats. This is more problematic for in-memory sinks, as there is currently no way of getting the metadata from the sink before it's persisted.\r\n\r\nExplore if we can expose these stats to the writer, to make the above easier.",
