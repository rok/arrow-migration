Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI will be working on a patch to make the initial Arrow C++ `libarrow.so` library callable from Cython (http://cython.org/) extensions. For the uninitiated, Cython is the modern \"gold standard\" for interoperability with C++ libraries. I have used it recently to create Kudu's Python client (https://github.com/apache/incubator-kudu/tree/master/python/kudu).\n\nA significant amount of Python \"glue code\" will be needed to interoperate with pandas, NumPy, and other standard Python libraries (in addition to Python's built-in scalar data types), but these will be the subject of many follow up JIRAs.",

As you will see when I get the patches put together, the extent of the low-level interoperability required to make this work well goes significantly beyond what is possible with CFFI. In particular, significant use of the Python and NumPy C APIs.  "
