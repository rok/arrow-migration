        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14560](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14560). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile trying to replicate an issue in the Flight SQL PR, I found that we can no longer build with tests via vcpkg. The\u00a0[nightly CI](https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/4076479479?check_suite_focus=true) has the same issue. This is because of a [new check](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/21116) added recently in vcpkg; now only the latest GTest package builds (the revised 1.11 package - note they didn't increment the port-version so right now I can't figure out how to get an override in).\r\n\r\nI think the solution is to update our vcpkg baseline and GTest version.\r\n```\n\r\n-- Performing post-build validation\r\nThere should be no pkgconfig directories outside of lib and debug/lib.\r\nThe following misplaced pkgconfig files were found:    /vcpkg/packages/gtest_x64-linux/lib/manual-link/pkgconfig/gtest_main.pc\r\n    /vcpkg/packages/gtest_x64-linux/lib/manual-link/pkgconfig/gmock_main.pc\r\n    /vcpkg/packages/gtest_x64-linux/debug/lib/manual-link/pkgconfig/gtest_main.pc\r\n    /vcpkg/packages/gtest_x64-linux/debug/lib/manual-link/pkgconfig/gmock_main.pcYou can move the pkgconfig files with the following commands:    file(INSTALL \"${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/a/path/pkgconfig/name.pc\" DESTINATION \"${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/a/path/pkgconfig\")\r\n    file(REMOVE_RECURSE \"${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/a/path/pkgconfig\")Found 1 error(s). Please correct the portfile:\r\n    /vcpkg/buildtrees/versioning/versions/gtest/8dd6b8fb34e78fd1646f5d98720dd563d4a38a33/portfile.cmake \n```\r\nThis may be specific to the PR but I also found that updating the vcpkg baseline breaks elsewhere as the version of Boost installed doesn't have the UUID package anymore. (I think that's an issue for the PR, though.)",
