Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSupport inferring a struct type in a `pa.array` call, if a sequence of dicts (or dict of sequences?= is given. Of course, this could mean that the wrong field order may be inferred, though on Python 3.6+ dicts retain ordering until the first deletion.",
