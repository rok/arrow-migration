        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16947](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16947). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~kou]` (re-)added this dependency in ARROW-16721: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13292/files#r890849903. But looking at thrift/transport/TBufferTransports.h, the header we include that uses boost, the class we use from it doesn't seem to require boost itself. So maybe we can pull the class definition out that we need and inline/vendor it, so that we can drop the need for that header, and thus drop the need for boost with thrift.",

Since it will take time for that to get merged and released and for us to update our bundled version, can we apply https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/apache/thrift/pull/2630.diff in a patch step now?"

This approach is for system Thrift not bundled Thrift.\r\n\r\nWe need to use bundled Thrift to use a patch step. But we sill need Boost to build Thrift with the patch.\r\n\r\nAnd there are still some `#include <boost/...>`s in public headers with the patch. e.g.:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/cpp/src/thrift/transport/TTransportException.h#L23\n- https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/cpp/src/thrift/processor/TMultiplexedProcessor.h#L26\n- https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/cpp/src/thrift/protocol/TProtocol.h#L95\n  \n  We need more steps to complete this approach. \n"

It means that we don't need Boost with system Thrift 0.17.0 or later.\r\n\r\nWe need more work to remove Boost dependency for bundled Thrift. Because we still need Boost for building Thrift. But Thrift developers want to remove build-time Boost dependency too: https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2630#issuecomment-1242712937\r\n\r\n> Thanks to you! If you have more such changes, please keep them coming!\r\n\r\nSo, our contributions to remove build-time Boost dependency will be welcome."
