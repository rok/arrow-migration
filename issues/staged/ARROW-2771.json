Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `Table` class would be much easier to interact with if it returned familiar Javascript objects representing a row. As Jeff Heer [demonstrated](https://beta.observablehq.com/@jheer/from-apache-arrow-to-javascript-objects) it's possible to create JS Proxy objects that read directly from Arrow memory. We should generate these types of objects in `Table.get` and in the `Table` iterator.",
