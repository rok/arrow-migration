Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe followup to actually fix this is ARROW-17809 (the first try was ARROW-17643). It is likely a DuckDB problem; however, it's difficult to diagnose and will take some time. In the meantime, we should just skip the test because it is obscuring other failures.",
