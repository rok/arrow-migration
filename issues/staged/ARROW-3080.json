Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimilar to ARROW-2814, we have inconsistent support for converting Arrow nested types back to object sequences. For example, a list of structs fails when calling `to_pandas`",

The conversion is happening in pure Python inside the Cython modules when `to_pylist` or `to_pydict` is called"
