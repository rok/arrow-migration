Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-10640 adds an `if_else` kernel to the C++ library. Add R bindings so users can call `ifelse()` or `if_else()` (the stricter dplyr variant) in dplyr verbs. I believe the C++ kernel requires the second and third arguments to have the same types, just like `dplyr::if_else()`.",
