Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe output order for a Substrait aggregate is:\r\n\r\n> The list of distinct columns from each grouping set (ordered by their first appearance) followed by the list of measures in declaration order\r\n\r\nHowever, the current aggregate node in Acero emits measures first and grouping set second.  This could be fixed with a supplementary project but it seems simpler to modify the aggregate node itself.  However, this would be a backwards incompatible change.",
