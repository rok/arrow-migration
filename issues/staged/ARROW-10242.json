I was unable to reproduce the issue on any of the parquet data sets that I usually test with, but they are simple data sets containing primitive types. My first guess here is that there is something in the files that DataFusion doesn't support and the error message is being suppressed, but this is just a guess. Do your files contain nested types?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDo you see any other errors before the disconnected channel error?"

I'll start by removing all the fields and field types and adding one at a time and see what causes it to explode.\r\n\r\nI'm not seeing any other errors.\r\n\r\nThanks for the swift response!"
