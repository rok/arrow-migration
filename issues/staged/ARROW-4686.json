Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current prompt syntax (\"y/n\" with neither capitalized) implies there's no default, which I think is the right behavior, but it's not implemented that way. Script should retry until either y or n is received.",
