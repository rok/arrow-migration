        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16836](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16836). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe added RecordBatchReader::Close(), should we have an exported ArrowArrayStream call this? \r\n\r\nThe issue is that `release()` can't return errors. We could call `Close()` implicitly after the last batch if the user drains the ArrowArrayStream, and return any error there, but if they don't drain the stream (but call `release`) we'll have no way to return the error. (Or we could make an ABI break\u2026)",
