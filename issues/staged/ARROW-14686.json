Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAlthough the current NumPy converter code tries to detect endian against a given object, it does not work for a built-in object. This is because a build-in object may have `native |` byte order.\r\n\r\nThis issue causes test failure as follows:\r\n```java\n\r\nFAILED pyarrow/tests/test_array.py::test_array_from_numpy_unicode - UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-32-le' codec can't decode bytes in position 0-3: code point not in range(0x110000)\r\nFAILED pyarrow/tests/test_array.py::test_array_from_strided - UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-32-le' codec can't decode bytes in position 0-3: code point not in range(0x110000)\r\nFAILED pyarrow/tests/test_array.py::test_array_from_numpy_str_utf8 - UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-32-le' codec can't decode bytes in position 0-3: code point not in range(0x110000) \n```\r\n\u00a0",
