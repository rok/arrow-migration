Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current implementation of ipc.FileReader does not use the memory.Allocator interface. Reading records from a file results in a large number of allocations since the record body buffer is allocated each time without reuse.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/go/arrow/ipc/metadata.go#L106",
