        "title": "[C++][Parquet] Improve error message in append_row_groups() when appending disjoint metadata",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16431). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently if you try to append together metadata from row groups with different schemas (?), you get the following error: \r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n  File \"/home/mmilton/.conda/envs/mmilton/envs/driverpipe/lib/python3.9/site-packages/dask/dataframe/io/parquet/arrow.py\", line 52, in _append_row_groups\r\n    metadata.append_row_groups(md)\r\n  File \"pyarrow/_parquet.pyx\", line 628, in pyarrow._parquet.FileMetaData.append_row_groups\r\n    self._metadata.AppendRowGroups(deref(c_metadata))\r\nRuntimeError: AppendRowGroups requires equal schemas.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would be useful here is to actually pass the schema difference in the error object in terms of which columns disagree. This information should _also_ be in the error message.\r\n\r\nFor example if it said:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nRuntimeError: AppendRowGroups requires equal schemas. Column \"foo\" was previously an int32 but the latest row group is storing it as an int64\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

That would indeed be a welcome improvement of the error message (or at least we could print the two schemas, if it is not that easy to infer the exact difference between both).\r\n\r\n"
