Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor vector classes, the get method first checks if the value at the given index is null. If it is not null, the method goes ahead to retrieve the value. \r\nFor some scenarios, the first check is redundant, because the application code has already checked the null, before calling the get method. This redundant check may have non-trivial performance overheads. \r\n\r\nSo we add a flag to enable/disable the null checking, so the user can set the flag according to their own specific scenario.
