And so when we have a more general expression API, this function should also be updated to return this new expression type, so that it keeps working for pyarrow.dataset. \r\n_If_ that is the only case for which the function would be used, I don't think there is any risk in increasing the surface area.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could also accept the DNF-like lists of tuples in the pyarrow.dataset functions and methods, so that external projects like dask and cudf don't have to convert this to a pyarrow Expression themselves. \r\nWe decided against it (not wanting to expand support for DNF-like nested lists), but doing this would actually decrease the exposure of the current dataset-specific expressions, as external project would not need to create them to be able to use the filtering functionality."
