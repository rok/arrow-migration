Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis should apply primarly to DataType, Field, and Schema. It should not try to print things like metadata and nullability. This is not meant for serialization but quick glance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ni32\r\nlist<i32>\r\ndict<utf8,i8>\r\nstruct<<a,i32>,<b,struct<<n,utf8>>>>\r\nschema<<a,i32>>\n```\r\nOnce we have that, we can have a small print diagnostic to array/tables like R.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
