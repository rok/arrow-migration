Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf we switch the order of keys in a equijoin this results in an error. It seems that some code assumes that the left key in the expression is in the left input of the join and the right key comes from the right side.\r\n\r\nFor example changing\u00a0l_orderkey = o_orderkey to\r\n o_orderkey = l_orderkey\r\n\r\nin query 12 of\u00a0 the tpch benchmark, we get this error:\r\n \u00a0\r\n `Error: Plan(\"The left or right side of the join does not have all columns on \\\"on\\\": \nMissing on the left: \\{\\\"o_orderkey\\\"}\nMissing on the right: \\{\\\"l_orderkey\\\"}\")`\r\n \u00a0",
