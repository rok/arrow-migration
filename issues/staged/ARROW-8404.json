Wes suggested opening an issue here. The idea is to add metadata to a data frame to store and display information about the data (e.g., variable descriptions, data source, main company contact about data, changes, etc. etc.). For a simple example in R (+ shiny) that uses a \"description\" attribute in markdown format and then renders it in HTML when loaded, see the link below. See the description for the diamonds data.\r\n\r\n<https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/radiant>\r\n\r\nHaving a data format that works for both R and Python **and**\u00a0maintains attributes like a data description would be great!\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/wesm/feather/issues/328>",
