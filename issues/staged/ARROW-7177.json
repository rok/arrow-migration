        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7177](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7177). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nVector loading/unloading transforms a set of vectors to and from a set of buffers with meta data. It is heavily used in flight/IPC.\r\n\r\nIn the loading/unloading operations, only the number of type buffers are really needed. However, the current code logic gets a copy of the type buffers, which is not necessary.\r\n\r\nIn this issue, we provide a utility to get the number of type buffers, given an arrow type. It improves the performance because it removes the following overhead:\r\n\r\n1. creating type buffer objects unnecessarily.\r\n2. creating a list and copying list contents (in TypeLayout#getBufferTypes) for vector unloading.",
