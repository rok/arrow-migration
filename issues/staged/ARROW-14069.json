Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs users can't call hash functions directly in `list_compute_functions()`, we should filter those out so they're not displayed.  Perhaps via a parameter if we still need those for our internal uses of `list_compute_functions()`?",
