Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn pyarrow/adapters/pandas.cc:\nThere looks like there are at least a couple of instances of code of this sort\n`693           out_values[i] = make_pystring(data, length);\n694           if (out_values[i] == nullptr) {\n695             return Status::OK();\n696           }`\n\n\nI believe this should be returning an error status.  `[~wesmckinn]`?\n",
