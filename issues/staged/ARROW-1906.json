Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is similar to ARROW-1680 but slightly different in that an error is not raised but the unit will still remain unchanged only when using a timezone\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nIn [47]: us_with_tz = pa.timestamp('us', tz='America/New_York')\r\n\r\nIn [48]: s = pd.Series([val])\r\n\r\nIn [49]: s_nyc = s.dt.tz_localize('tzlocal()').dt.tz_convert('America/New_York')\r\n\r\nIn [50]: arr = pa.Array.from_pandas(s_nyc, type=us_with_tz)\r\n\r\nIn [51]: arr.type\r\nOut[51]: TimestampType(timestamp[ns, tz=America/New_York])\r\n\r\nIn [52]: arr2 = pa.Array.from_pandas(s, type=pa.timestamp('us'))\r\n\r\nIn [53]: arr2.type\r\nOut[53]: TimestampType(timestamp[us])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is an easy workaround to apply the cast after creating the pyarrow.Array, which seems to work fine\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nIn [54]: arr = pa.Array.from_pandas(s_nyc).cast(us_with_tz, safe=False)\r\n\r\nIn [55]: arr.type\r\nOut[55]: TimestampType(timestamp[us, tz=America/New_York])\r\n```",
