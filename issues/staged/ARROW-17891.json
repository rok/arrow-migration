Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome of the things that are missing/outdated:\r\n \\* `ARROW_HOME` should be same as in Linux&MacOs section (only `dist`)\r\n \\* setting of the `PATH` variable is not needed as Python doesn't use it anymore in the dll search path (3.8+)\r\n \\* use Python 3.10\r\n \\* it seems that invoking cmake in Win is case sensitive as the following\r\n```java\n\r\ncmake --build . --target INSTALL --config Release \n```\r\ndidn't work for me and this did:\r\n```java\n\r\ncmake --build . --target install --config Release \n```\r\nI see the same on [AppVeyor](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/appveyor-cpp-build.bat#L91).\u00a0\r\n\r\nI needed to set `ARROW_STATIC=OFF` to make the Arrow C++ build successful and I see the same in the [AppVeyor build](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/appveyor-cpp-build.bat#L61). Not sure why this is needed, but it should also be added in the docs.\u00a0",
