Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe would use this for alignment with `readr::write_csv()`. There the `escape` argument controls the type of escape to use when quotes are in the data:\r\n- `double`: quotes are escaped by doubling them\n- `backslash`: quotes are escaped by a preceding backslash\n- `none`: quotes are not escaped",
