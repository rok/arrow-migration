Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `lintr` is being run multiple times (on several R versions), with each run taking somewhere around 5-7 minutes (on occasion longer).\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to:\r\n- run lintr once\n- speed up the installation of `lintr` dependencies via caching and / or using `pak::pkg_install()`.",

Seems like we just need to add an `if` to that step and have it only run on one of them."
