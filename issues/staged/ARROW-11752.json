We could also write our own helper something like `expect_r6_class` that uses `expect_s3_class` and then also checks that the object is _also_ an R6 object."

That will run install the current version of the arrow r package, set up some environment variables for the run and run the tests for you. https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/Makefile#L26-L28 for more details on what that's doing."
