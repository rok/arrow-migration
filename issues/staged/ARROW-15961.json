Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAccording to ARROW-15899, it is possible to declare a field non-nullable, associate with data that has nulls, and still pass validation.\r\n\r\nValidation should instead fail in such a situation (at least full validation, since computing the null count can be O\\(n\\)).",
