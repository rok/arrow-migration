        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1459](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1459). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen reading partitioned parquet files (tested with those produced by Spark), that contain lists, the resulting table seems to contain data loaded only from one partition. Primitive types seems to be loaded correctly.\n\nIt can be reproduced using following code (arrow 0.6.0, spark 2.1.1):\n\n\n```\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame(list(zip(np.arange(10).tolist(), np.arange(20).reshape((10,2)).tolist())))\n>>> df.toPandas()\n   _1        _2\n0   0    [0, 1]\n1   1    [2, 3]\n2   2    [4, 5]\n3   3    [6, 7]\n4   4    [8, 9]\n5   5  [10, 11]\n6   6  [12, 13]\n7   7  [14, 15]\n8   8  [16, 17]\n9   9  [18, 19]\n>>> df.repartition(2).write.parquet('df_parts.parquet')\n>>> pq.read_table('df_parts.parquet').to_pandas()\n   _1        _2\n0   0    [0, 1]\n1   2    [4, 5]\n2   4    [8, 9]\n3   6  [12, 13]\n4   8  [16, 17]\n5   1    [0, 1]\n6   3    [4, 5]\n7   5    [8, 9]\n8   7  [12, 13]\n9   9  [16, 17]\n```\n\nWhen the data is loaded using Spark or coalesced into one partition, everything works as expected:\n\n```\n>>> spark.read.parquet('df_parts.parquet').toPandas()\n   _1        _2\n0   1    [2, 3]\n1   3    [6, 7]\n2   5  [10, 11]\n3   7  [14, 15]\n4   9  [18, 19]\n5   0    [0, 1]\n6   2    [4, 5]\n7   4    [8, 9]\n8   6  [12, 13]\n9   8  [16, 17]\n>>> df.coalesce(1).write.parquet('df_single.parquet')\n>>> pq.read_table('df_single.parquet').to_pandas()\n   _1        _2\n0   0    [0, 1]\n1   1    [2, 3]\n2   2    [4, 5]\n3   3    [6, 7]\n4   4    [8, 9]\n5   5  [10, 11]\n6   6  [12, 13]\n7   7  [14, 15]\n8   8  [16, 17]\n9   9  [18, 19]\n```\n",

However it seems that the fix doesn't solve the problem. Using 0.6.1.dev64+g9968d95d only makes thing stranger:\n\n```\n>>> pq.read_table('df_parts.parquet').to_pandas()\n   _1        _2\n0   5  [10, 11]\n1   7  [14, 15]\n2   9  [18, 19]\n3   0    [0, 1]\n4   2    [4, 5]\n5   4    [8, 9]\n6   6    [0, 1]\n7   8    [4, 5]\n8   1    [8, 9]\n9   3  [12, 13]\n```\n"
