Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe synchronous Scanner is not integrated with ExecPlans and doesn't offer better performance in any case than the asynchronous scanner, so we should start migrating away from the extraneous code path so it can be deprecated and then deleted.",

Leave it how it is for 5.0.0, async is an opt-in feature\r\n\r\n\u00a02. Set async to default, leave sync alone, async is an opt-out feature\r\n\r\n\u00a03. Set async to default, deprecate sync, async is an opt-out but strongly recommended feature\r\n\r\nIf I had to vote I'd go for 1 or 2 and probably 2."

The async write is coming along fine and should be available for 6.0.0 but it is not clear to me yet that 6.0.0's async scanner will support back pressure.  If the async scanner does not have that feature then I would be reluctant to make it the default.  I will try and resolve this soon."
