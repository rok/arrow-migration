Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNDEBUG is not shipped in linker flags, so I got a linker error with release build on FixedSizeBinaryBuilder::UnsafeAppend(util::string_view value) call, since it makes a call to CheckValueSize.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat a follow-up of ARROW-2313. I took the same path by removing NDEBUG ifdefs around CheckValueSize definition and declaration.\r\n\r\nI applied the same fix to CheckUTF8Initialized as well after grepping the source code for \"#ifndef NDEBUG\" and figured out it has the same issue.",
