        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15756](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15756). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt can be convenient to use Flight to abstract over communication within a process and between two processes. We should add this case to the benchmark to start. UCX has an in-process loopback transport (`UCX_TLS=self`), and ARROW-15282 will enable implementing a specialized transport if more performance is desired (e.g. possibly based on the C Data Interface).",
