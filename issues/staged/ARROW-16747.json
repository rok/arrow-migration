        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16747](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16747). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere seemed to be consensus on this mailing list thread to drop support for Manylinux 2010.\r\n\r\n<https://lists.apache.org/thread/dfsvcsmrmktgnqz9fyc9ym33zldwklyx>\r\n\r\nThis ticket is to track it. The following was the main rationale to do it copied from the mail:\r\n\r\nCentoOS 6, on which the manylinux2010 image is based, has been EOL for over\r\ntwo years [1].\r\nThere is now also an official announcement by pypa that\r\nmanylinux2010 support will be dropped sometime in 2022 [2] that has not\r\nreceived any feedback on either Github or Discourse. Since the announcement\r\nthe percentage of affected users has dropped from ~7% to ~4% of Python 3.7\r\nusers [3]. ~52% of pyarrow users are on 3.7 so only ~2% of pyarrow users\r\n[4] would potentially be affected by an issue fixed by updating pip [5].\r\n\r\nWe have already had several CI issues with the manylinux2010 builds that\r\nrequired workarounds. There are now also issues with verification as there\r\nare no aarch64 wheels for manylinux2010 [6].\r\n\r\n[1]: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/#Life_Cycle_Dates> \r\n[2]: <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/1281> \r\n[3]: <https://mayeut.github.io/manylinux-timeline/> \r\n[4]: <https://pypistats.org/packages/pyarrow> \r\n[5]: <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v19-3> \r\n[6]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16476 \r\n\r\n\u00a0",

But you're right it's just a matter of installing pip, since basically 99.9% of the user base is glibc-compatible.\r\n"
