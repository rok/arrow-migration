        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-86](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-86). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor this to work, we need:\n\n- a check if the Arrow Array could be represented as Pandas Series using the same memory buffer\n- a `numpy.ndarray` subclass that keeps a reference to the Arrow Array\n\nWith the NumPy C-API it is already possible to create a `numpy.ndarray` instance that uses the Arrow Array memory buffer internally but there is no way to keep track if the `numpy.ndarray` still lives or the underlying memory can be free'd.",

For numeric or boolean data without any nulls, zero-copy would be great."
