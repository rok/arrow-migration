Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile we do not have a formal roadmap per se (beyond our JIRA), it would be helpful to publish a list of high level development areas where we are interested in growing the project. This will be easier to point people to who ask about the project roadmap than going through JIRAs. We can update the roadmap periodically as we progress. ",
