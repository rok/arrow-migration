Can you provide a small reproducible example? \r\n\r\nAlso, what do you mean with \"write ISO strings\". I don't think pyarrow 0.13.0 was actually writing timestamps as strings (rather as integers), so it might be an issue with the representation of the value."

However, there are some compatibility problems where the older ConvertedType is omitted for tz-naive data (see ARROW-5878). \r\n\r\nCould you try with timezone aware data to check if you are encountering the same issue? Because it might be that the S3 parquet reader does not yet understand the new LogicalTypes, and thus the absence of the ConvertedType annotation could lead to interpreting it as just integers (as you see in the output)\r\n\r\nI don't think there is an option to **not** write those new LogicalTypes, but the omission of the ConvertedType annotation is a bug that should be fixed for 0.14.1.\r\n"
