Or did it succeed, and then the arrow build can't find it (similar to ARROW-9532)?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our nightly homebrew formula tests aren't running due to the Travis-CI issues, so we can't tell whether a change we made recently broke this, or whether it is a quirk of homebrew's version of things."
