Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `reset()` method exists in some ValueVectors but not all.  Its meaning is that it will bring the vector to an empty state, but not release any buffers (as opposed to clear() which resets and releases buffers).\r\n\r\nIt should be added to the `ValueVector` interface and implemented in the vector hierarchy where it currently is not.
