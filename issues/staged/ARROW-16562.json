        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16562](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16562). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor scalar functions, `ExecBatchIterator` is used to iterate over batches in smaller units. It is implemented by calling `{}Array::slice(){`}. For small batches, this is unecessary, since only one slice is created. The slice operation still causes some overhead by copying the shrared_ptrs of the ArrayData object, inclung the type pointer, which can lead to contention (ARROW-16161).\r\n\r\nThis Patch checks if the batch size is smaller than the slice size first, and uses std::move in this case.\r\n\r\nI have attached a comparision of the ExecuteScalarExpressionOverhead benchmark here: [avoid-slicing-performance.txt](avoid-slicing-performance.txt)\u00a0\r\n\r\n(created with --benchmark_min_time=20, the standard low runtime tends to be noisy with this, but also shows a positive tendency)",
