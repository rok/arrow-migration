Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the CSV chunker can be the bottleneck in multi-threaded reads (starting from 6 threads, according to my experiments). One way to make it faster is to consider by default that CSV values cannot contain newline characters (overridable via a setting), and then simply search for the last newline character in each block of data.",
