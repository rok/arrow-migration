Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis may be a bit annoying as grpc's CMake files want to also install its third party dependencies. `[~msarahan]` pointed me to a version for AnacondaRecipes where there was an effort to \"unvendor\" these components\r\n\r\ngrpc depends on at least\r\n\r\n- protobuf\n- zlib\n- either boringssl or openssl\n- cares\n- gflags\n  \n  It looks like the grpc developers want to take on Abseil as a dependency eventually, but it is not required yet",

Very painful. I had to override a bunch of environment variables to get it to use the proper toolchain executables instead of using the system compilers\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nLD=$CXX \\\r\nLDXX=$CXX \\\r\nHOST_CC=$CC \\\r\nHOST_CXX=$CXX \\\r\nSTRIP='echo' \\\r\nAR='ar rcs' \\\r\nprefix=$PREFIX make -j8 install\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason the build system is stripping all the static libraries, and so I couldn't get them to link with the Flight C++ executables, the errors looked like this:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:327: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::InsecureServerCredentials()'\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:327: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::ServerBuilder::AddListeningPort(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, std::shared_ptr<grpc::ServerCredentials>, int*)'\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:328: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::ServerBuilder::RegisterService(grpc::Service*)'\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:330: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::ServerBuilder::BuildAndStart()'\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:326: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::ServerBuilder::~ServerBuilder()'\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:326: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::ServerBuilder::~ServerBuilder()'\r\n/home/wesm/cpp-toolchain/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/slice.h:40: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::g_core_codegen_interface'\r\n/home/wesm/cpp-toolchain/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/slice.h:40: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::g_core_codegen_interface'\r\n/home/wesm/cpp-toolchain/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/slice.h:53: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::g_core_codegen_interface'\r\n/home/wesm/cpp-toolchain/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/slice.h:53: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::g_core_codegen_interface'\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:161: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::Status::OK'\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:242: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::Status::OK'\r\n/home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/server.cc:268: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::Status::OK'\r\n/home/wesm/cpp-toolchain/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/grpc_library.h:42: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::g_glip'\r\n/home/wesm/cpp-toolchain/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/grpc_library.h:45: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::g_glip'\r\n/home/wesm/cpp-toolchain/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/grpc_library.h:45: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::g_glip'\r\n/home/wesm/cpp-toolchain/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/grpc_library.h:51: error: undefined reference to 'grpc::g_glip'\r\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n```"
