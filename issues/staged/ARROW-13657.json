You will also get an import error if you attempt to import pyarrow.gandiva, which is also an optional feature. It is turned off for arm64 MacOS here:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/8f0ddc785dd72e950b570f3bc380deb15c124c45/dev/tasks/python-wheels/github.osx.arm64.yml#L26>\r\n\r\nThe Conda-packaged pyarrow has Flight and other optional features enabled. As a workaround, you can either install through conda, or built a custom wheel with the components you want.\r\n\r\nIf you think this should be added to the wheel, you are welcome to open a feature request/or re-classify this as one."

It is really helpful. I created a new ticket (ARROW-16779) in regards for Pyarrow Flight to be shipped in arm64 MacOS version of the wheel.\r\n\r\nWhat is the timeline for the new feature request and who do we reach out to , to get this feature request prioritized?"
