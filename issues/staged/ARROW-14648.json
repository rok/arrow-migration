        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14648](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14648). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the scanner readahead is controlled by \"batch_readahead\" and \"fragment_readahead\" (both specified in the scan options).\u00a0 This was mainly motivated on my work with CSV and the defaults of 32 and 8 will cause the scanner to buffer ~256MB of data (given the default block size of 1MB).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor parquet / IPC this would mean we are buffering 256 row groups which is entirely too high.\r\n\r\nRather than make users figure out complex parameters we should have a single readahead limit that is specified in bytes.\r\n\r\nThis will be \"best effort\".\u00a0 I'm not suggest we support partial reads of row groups / record batches so if the limit is set very small we still might end up with more in RAM just because we can only load entire row groups.",
