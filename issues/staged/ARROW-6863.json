Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor scenarios where the vector is large and the a low response time is required, we need to search the vector in parallel to improve the responsiveness.\r\n\r\nThis issue tries to provide a parallel searcher for the equality semantics (the support for ordering semantics is not ready yet, as we need a way to distribute the comparator).\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on multi-threading.",
