Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be nice if we would get automated comments by <https://pep8speaks.com/>\u00a0on the Python PRs. This should be much better readable than the current `flake8` ouput in the Travis logs. This issue is split up into two tasks:\r\n \\* Create an issue with INFRA kindly asking them for activating pep8speaks for Arrow\r\n \\* Setup `.pep8speaks.yml` to align with our `flake8` config. For reference, see Pandas' config:\u00a0<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/.pep8speaks.yml>\u00a0",

If we find that the feedback isn't fast enough in the future we can look for a way to bubble lint failures into PR comments"
