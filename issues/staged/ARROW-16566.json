Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe are using Arrow in Spark. When the specification is turned on, it is possible for the task to be forcibly killed during the running process. It means, `JniLoader.get().ensureLoaded()` maybe failed with `ClosedByInterruptException` when the task was killed. Meanwhile `NativeMemoryPool` use it as a static code, this leads to an init failure every time the NativeMemroyPool is trying to initialized and can never succeed. It would always fail to init `NativeMemoryPool` with `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.apache.arrow.dataset.jni.NativeMemoryPool`",
