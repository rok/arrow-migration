Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAdd a `warning_msg = NA` or the like as an argument to `expect_dplyr_equal()` that check + ensures we aren't pulling data into R and then running the dplyr query. \r\n\r\nBut will need to re-arrange where warnings like https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/76924612bebb0b3ce0e0cababc5f9be3ce7e6688/r/tests/testthat/test-dplyr-mutate.R#L198 are being expected.",
