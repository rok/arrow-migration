        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5655](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5655). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExample with `from_pydict` (from https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4601#issuecomment-503676534):\r\n\r\n```python\n\r\nIn [15]: table = pa.Table.from_pydict(\r\n    ...:     {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [3, 4, 5]},\r\n    ...:     schema=pa.schema([('a', pa.int64()), ('c', pa.int32())]))\r\n\r\nIn [16]: table\r\nOut[16]: \r\npyarrow.Table\r\na: int64\r\nc: int32\r\n\r\nIn [17]: table.to_pandas()\r\nOut[17]: \r\n   a  c\r\n0  1  3\r\n1  2  0\r\n2  3  4\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the specified schema has 1) different column names and 2) has a non-default type (int32 vs int64) which leads to corrupted values.\r\n\r\nThis is partly due to `Table.from_pydict` not using the type information in the schema to convert the dictionary items to pyarrow arrays. But then it is also `Table.from_arrays` that is not correctly casting the arrays to another dtype if the schema specifies as such.\r\n\r\nAdditional question for `Table.pydict` is whether it actually should override the 'b' key from the dictionary as column 'c' as defined in the schema (this behaviour depends on the order of the dictionary, which is not guaranteed below python 3.6).\r\n",
