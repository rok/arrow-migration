Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently a buffer/array builder is consumed after `finish()` is called. This may not be very convenient as one may want to use the same builder for multiple arrays. This changes the behavior of it to reset the builder instead.",
