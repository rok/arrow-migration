Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe issue is that CC/CXX environment variables are captured on the first invocation of the builder (e.g make or ninja) instead of when CMake is invoked into to build directory. This can lead to compilation errors (notably when compiling with clang in the top directory due to the addition of the `-Qunused-arguments` option).\r\n\r\nThis leads to an issue where I have a script that prepare the build directory and export CXX within the script. When I jump in the build folder, there's a mismatch between the external gbenchmark (and all deps if conda is not used) compiler and the build.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new build directory with clang as compiler, don't build yet\n1. In a new shell (without the compiler environment variable), go into directory invoke make/ninja",

Instead, we should encourage developers to keep their environment variables consistent (through the use of files that are sourced on each shell initialization, here is mine: https://github.com/wesm/dev-toolchain/blob/master/toolchain/arrow-toolchain.sh) while they are developing"
