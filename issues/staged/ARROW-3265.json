(I just list packages what we are interested in.)\r\n\r\nFor .deb and .rpm, we already have them. And we can't use CPack based packages in the official Debian/Fedora repository. For example, MariaDB can use CPack for .rpm\u00a0https://mariadb.org/get-involved/packaging/ but Fedora doesn't use MariaDB's one: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mariadb/tree/master\r\n\r\nFor .tar.gz, we already have it.\r\n\r\nFor .zip (Windows binary package), we don't have it. CPack may be useful for this case. For example, I'm using CPack to generate .zip for PGroonga https://github.com/pgroonga/pgroonga/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L199 .\r\nBut we can do the same thing by `cmake --build . --target install` and `7z a %INSTALL_FOLDER%`:\r\nhttps://github.com/groonga/groonga/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L94\r\nhttps://github.com/groonga/groonga/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L119\r\nIn Groonga, I'm creating .zip for each commit on AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/groonga/groonga/builds/22159025/job/p6h7qxqgh2txgb9c/artifacts\r\nFor MSYS2 users, .zip is not needed. We should maintain https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/tree/master/mingw-w64-arrow than .zip.\r\nFor Visual C++ users, vcpkg https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg support may be useful. But I don't use it yet.\r\n\r\nFor .exe (Windows installer), we don't have it. But I think that it's needless. Because Apache Arrow is a library not an application."
