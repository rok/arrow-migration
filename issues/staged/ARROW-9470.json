Is it important to enable RAT checks in the Java build system? We already have a custom CI run, as well as `archery lint --rat` to check for RAT issues.\r\n\r\ncc `[~lidavidm]` `[~emkornfield]` `[~rymurr]`"

So does the fmpp plugin that generates the vector code from templates. So even if we could turn off RAT we still have to sort out that plugin. If I had to bet I would guess they are both thread safe but we would have to check the code to be certain (here is RAT plugin for those of you who like spelunking through svn repos: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur/rat/tags/apache-rat-project-0.13/apache-rat-plugin/src/)\r\n\r\nThe parallel build is a bit faster on my development machine (3 min vs 4min) so not drastic and I expect the CI machines are smaller/less parallel. Maybe something to investigate if the Java project gets bigger?"
