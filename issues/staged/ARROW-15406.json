        "title": "[Python] Change the default read partitioning flavor to hive",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15406](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15406). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the default for reading datasets is to do no partitioning.  So given the dataset:\r\n\r\n/foo=1/part0.parquet\r\n/foo=2/part0.parquet\r\n\r\nit will not detect the \"foo\" partition.  Changing the default to hive should be harmless in most cases (the only way it could be a problem is if a user had x=y in their directory name and it wasn't intended to be a partition).\r\n\r\nThis may put us at odds with the default partitioning for writes (ARROW-15407) but specifying \"partitioning=hive\" on a directory partitioned dataset is no worse than specifying \"partitioning=None\" on a  directory partitioned dataset which is what we do today.",
