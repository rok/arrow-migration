        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1464](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1464). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I built Arrow GLib on macOS and Ubuntu-16.04, some tweaks listed below were required on my environment. I want to share them because they may help other users. Is there suitable place to describe them in the web site or source tree? Or, are there any other way to fix them?\n\n#### make install and ldconfig\nArrow GLib depends on Arrow C++, so it must be installed with `sudo make install` before building Arrow GLib. In addition, on linux, `sudo ldconfig` is also needed.\n\n#### configure script failed because of AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11 macro (macOS)\n1. Check whether `autoconf-archive` is installed.\n1. Run `brew install autoconf-archive` again. If it shows like the following message, run `brew link autoconf-acrhive`.\n   ```Java\n   $ brew install autoconf-archive\n   Warning: autoconf-archive 2017.03.21 is already installed, it's just not linked.\n   You can use `brew link autoconf-archive` to link this version.\n   ```\n\nNote that some packages (e.g. gnome-common) conflict with autoconf-archive. If you see like the following message, run `brew unlink <pkgname>`.\n```Java\n$ brew link autoconf-archive\nLinking /usr/local/Cellar/autoconf-archive/2017.03.21... \nError: Could not symlink share/aclocal/ax_check_enable_debug.m4\nTarget /usr/local/share/aclocal/ax_check_enable_debug.m4\nis a symlink belonging to gnome-common. You can unlink it:\n  brew unlink gnome-common\n```\n\n#### configure script can't find gobject-introspection-1.0 (macOS)\ngobject-introspection requires libffi, and it's automatically installed with gobject-introspection. However it can't be found because it's [keg-only](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ.html#what-does-keg-only-mean). You need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH when executing `configure`.\n```Java\n$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(brew --prefix libffi)/lib/pkgconfig ./configure\n```",

The page only has \"how to install by package\" information for now. It may be better that the page have \"how to install from source\" too.\n"
