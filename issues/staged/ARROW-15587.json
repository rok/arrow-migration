Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Substrait read operator defines files with LocalFiles::FileOrFiles.  These elements can take one of several forms:\r\n\r\nuri_path (can be a file or a folder)\r\nuri_path_glob (a glob expression)\r\nuri_file (file only)\r\nuri_folder (folder only)\r\n\r\nThe C++ Substrait consumer currently only supports uri_file.  We should add support for the other options.",

If there are multiple filesystems we could just return an error today (in the future we could maybe create multiple datasets and union them together).\r\n \\* Once we have a filesystem we can extract the path part from the URIs.  I'm pretty sure paths can be folders or files.\r\n \\* If we want to add glob support we should add that in the FileSystemDatasetFactory.  That can be done in a follow-up PR if we want to keep things simpler.\r\n"
