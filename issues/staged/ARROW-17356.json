Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-15260 adds a function which allows the user to add the filename as an output field.  This function only makes sense to use with datasets and not tables.  Currently, the error generated from using it with a table is handled by `handle_augmented_field_misuse()`.  Instead, we should follow [one of the suggestions from the PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12826#issuecomment-1192007298) to detect this when the function is called.",
