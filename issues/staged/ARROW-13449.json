Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFlightRPC.proto is ambiguous about whether schemas are meant to be the raw Flatbuffer or IPC-encapsulated, but all implementations choose the latter and it was intended to be encapsulated. We should update the comments.\r\n\r\nSee ML discussion: <https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rd3538bb70753661b33fb37ebde895bbf6859d044e5cc4c4f4353534c%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E>",

Is there something to change on the C++/Java side?\r\n\r\nI suppose the integration tests do not cover this so we could/should fix that, if you want to file a new issue"
