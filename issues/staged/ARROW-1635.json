Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow release process has grown increasingly complex and time consuming, and there are many manual steps that a release manager must undertake before, during, and after a release vote. I will write a document to list all of these. Some of them desperately need to be more automated (like updating the online API documentation and website). Binary packaging is still not as automated as it could be.",
