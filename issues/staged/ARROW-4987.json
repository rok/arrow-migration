Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of always building our vendored ORC from source, we should use the result of https://github.com/conda-forge/orc-feedstock. It would be even better when there were also windows builds for this but currently ORC doesn't build on Windows.",
