        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9733](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9733). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n## Reproducer:\r\n\r\nCreate a table with a string column:\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n```Java\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE repro(a INT, b VARCHAR)\r\nSTORED AS CSV\r\nWITH HEADER ROW\r\nLOCATION 'repro.csv';\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contents of repro.csv are as follows (also attached):\r\n```Java\n\r\na,b\r\n1,One\r\n1,Two\r\n2,One\r\n2,Two\r\n2,Two\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, run a query that tries to aggregate that column:\r\n```Java\n\r\nselect a, count(b) from repro group by a;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**:\r\n```Java\n\r\n> select a, count(b) from repro group by a;\r\nArrowError(ExternalError(ExecutionError(\"Unsupported data type Utf8 for result of aggregate expression\")))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nThe query runs and produces results\r\n```Java\n\r\na, count(b)\r\n1,2\r\n2,3\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nUsing Min/Max aggregates on varchar also doesn't work (but should):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n\r\n> select a, min(b) from repro group by a;\r\nArrowError(ExternalError(ExecutionError(\"Unsupported data type Utf8 for result of aggregate expression\")))\r\n> select a, max(b) from repro group by a;\r\nArrowError(ExternalError(ExecutionError(\"Unsupported data type Utf8 for result of aggregate expression\")))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFascinatingly these formulations work fine:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n> select a, count(a) from repro group by a;\r\n+---+----------+\r\n| a | count(a) |\r\n+---+----------+\r\n| 2 | 3        |\r\n| 1 | 2        |\r\n+---+----------+\r\n2 row in set. Query took 0 seconds.\r\n> select a, count(1) from repro group by a;\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n| a | count(UInt8(1)) |\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n| 2 | 3               |\r\n| 1 | 2               |\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n2 row in set. Query took 0 seconds.\r\n```\r\n",
