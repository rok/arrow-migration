Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowup to ARROW-9856. Use list_compute_functions (added here) to make all Arrow C++ compute functions available directly by name (in case you want to use the non-checked arithmetic, or an ascii specific kernel, or something without a natural R analogue). Will require a bit more refactoring to handle variable numbers of args, as well as some additional options handling.",
