Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOne thing that would make development more pleasant would be to speed up the s3fs tests. Currently, each test waits for the launch of a new Minio child process. Instead, we may launch several of them in advance (listening on different ports and targetting different temporary directories), so that most tests don't bear the launch cost.",
