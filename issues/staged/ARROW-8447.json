        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8447](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8447). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis can be refactored with a little effort in Scanner::ToTable:\r\n\r\n1. Change `batches` to `std::vector<RecordBatchVector>`\n1. When pushing the closure to the TaskGroup, also track an incrementing integer, e.g. scan_task_id\n1. In the closure, store the RecordBatches for this ScanTask in a local vector, when all batches are consumed, move the local vector in the `batches` at the right index, resizing and emplacing with mutex\n1. After waiting for the task group completion either\n- Flatten into a single vector and call `Table::FromRecordBatch` or\n- Write a RecordBatchReader that supports vector<vector<RecordBatch> and add method `Table::FromRecordBatchReader`\n  \n  The later involves more work but is the clean way, the other FromRecordBatch method can be implemented from it and support \"streaming\".",
