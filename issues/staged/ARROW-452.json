Since we've made no guarantees of file forward compatibility this should be OK. "

This is a true merging of implementations, which the intent of eventually deprecating the more limited Feather file format and moving Python/R users to use the more general Arrow file format. Performance with the current Feather format will be much higher for Python because the integration with pandas has gotten considerably more development in Arrow in the last few months"
