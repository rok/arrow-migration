Even though I call the function to do uncompressed compression. I still get an error Snappy codec support not built. How do I overcome this error and read a parquet file without snappy codec on linux?\r\nread_parquet(file,as_data_frame=TRUE,compression='UNCOMPRESSED')\r\n\r\nError in parquet___arrow___FileReader__ReadTable1(self) : IOError: NotImplemented: Snappy codec support not built",

So it sounds like you're trying to read a snappy-compressed file and thus need a build with snappy enabled. \r\n\r\nTo get that, since you already have arrow you could call `arrow::install_arrow()` and it should just work, installing a more complete version. Or you could set `LIBARROW_MINIMAL=FALSE` and reinstall by the usual ways. See https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html for more. "

In that new issue it would be helpful if you could also send what commands you're calling + the output (for even more verbose output which will help debug this, you can set the environment variable `ARROW_R_DEV` to true)  "
