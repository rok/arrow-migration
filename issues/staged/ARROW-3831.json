Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe can't know decompressed data size when we only have compressed data. The current `arrow::util::Codec::Decompress()` doesn't return decompressed data size. So we can't know which data in `output_buffer` can be used.\r\n\r\nFYI: `arrow::util::Codec::Compress()` returns compressed data size.",

If the actual decompressed size and the expected one is different, the compressed data will be broken (or decompress logic is broken).\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, zlib, LZ4 and Zstandard return the actual decompressed size."
