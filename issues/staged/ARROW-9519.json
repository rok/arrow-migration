        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9519](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9519). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when a name that does not exist on the Schema is passed to\u00a0`Schema::index_of`, the error message is just the name itself. This makes it a bit difficult to debug.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI propose that we change the that error message to something like\r\n\r\n`Unable to get field named \"nickname\". Valid fields: [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"address\"]`\r\n\r\nto make it easier to understand.",
