Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen buffers are transferred one vector to another, the ownership of the buffers needs to be transferred to the target vectors allocator. This is done in all of the other vectors, but BitVector, which is not generated using the freemarker templates, does not have this code implemented.\n\nThis causes memory accounting to be incorrect.",
