        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8537](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8537). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI optimized BitmapReader in [this PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6986) and see performance uplift of BitmapReader test case. I didn't check other test cases as this change looks trivial.\r\nI reviewed all test cases just now and see big performance drop of 4 cases, details at [PR link](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6986#issuecomment-616915079).\r\nI also compared performance of code using BitmapReader, no obvious changes found. Looks we should revert that PR.",
