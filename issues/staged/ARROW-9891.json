Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGiven a math function `g`, we compute g(f32) using g(cast(f32 AS f64)).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to make the operation be cast(g(f32) AS f64) instead.\r\n\r\nSince computations on f32 are faster than on f64, this is a simple optimization.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
