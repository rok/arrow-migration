        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14164](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14164). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe dataset writer currently groups incoming batches into large files which are controlled by max_rows_per_file.  In the PR for this work `[~jorisvandenbossche]` recommended an option where each incoming batch creates a new file.\r\n\r\nThis would give the user fine grained control over how many files are created (provided they are doing a very basic scan/filter/project and not using any more sophisticated nodes which may resize batches.)",
