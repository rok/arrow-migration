Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSSE4.2 has CRC32 intrinsics that can be used to compute hash values. It seems it may be acceptable to use `-msse4.2` on isolated compilation units, but if this object code is used on a machine without support for the SIMD instructions, then it will crash",
