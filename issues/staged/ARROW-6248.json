Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen file is absent pyarrow throws\u00a0\r\n```python\n\r\nArrowIOError('HDFS file does not exist: ...')\r\n```\r\nwhich inherits from `IOError` and `pyarrow.lib.ArrowException`, it would be better if that was `FileNotFoundError` a subclass of `IOError` for this particular purpose. Also, `.errno` property is empty (should be 2) so one needs to match by error message to check for particular error.\r\n\r\n**P.S.** There is no  `FileNotFoundError` in Python 2, but there is `.errno` property there.",
