        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16639](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16639). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFedora 36 includes both a 'libarrow' and a 'libarrow-dataset' package under pkg-config names 'arrow' and 'arrow-dataset', respectively. When we do `install.packages(\"arrow\")` on Fedora 36, the pkg-config for 'arrow' gets picked up first, and we get a minimal arrow install. Installing with `NOT_CRAN=true ARROW_USE_PKG_CONFIG=false` results in a full compiled installation because binaries are not available for fedora-36 (according to the install output).\r\n\r\nReported by Roger Bivand (while testing GDAL + Arrow support since Fedora 36 is the easiest place to do that due to system Arrow): https://github.com/paleolimbot/narrow/issues/7\r\n\r\nReproducble using the `fedora:36` docker container:\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\n# docker run --rm -it fedora:36\r\ndnf install -y R libarrow-dataset-devel cmake\r\nR -e 'install.packages(\"arrow\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org/\")'\r\nR -e 'arrow::arrow_info()$capabilities'\r\n```\r\n",

(I know that's easier said than done). One could also skip the pkg-config check if it's legal to download the binaries?"
