Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing a pandas dataframe to feather using its to_feather method, sometimes a single column's conversion fails in\u00a0pandas_compat.convert_column, which leads the whole method to fail. The error message should include\u00a0the name of the column that failed for easier debugging.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEg instead of:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nArrowInvalid: Error converting from Python objects to String/UTF8: Got Python object of type int but can only handle these types: str, bytes.\r\n\u00a0\r\n```\r\nThrow:\r\n```java\n\r\nArrowInvalid: Error converting from Python objects to String/UTF8: Got Python object of type int but can only handle these types: str, bytes. (column \"user_id\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOriginally opened on Github Issues:\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2072",
