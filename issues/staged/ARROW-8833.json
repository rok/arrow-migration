Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe binary arrow-json-integration-test.rs already supports converting arrow files to json, and json to arrow.\r\n\r\nWe now need to implement the VALIDATE command, which should read an Arrow and a JSON file and ensure that they contain the same batches.\r\n\r\nSee the Java implementation at java/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/tools/Integration.java for an example.",
