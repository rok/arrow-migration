Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNot sure if there is any plan to support groupby in arrow?\r\n\r\nHere is some to do in my mind:\r\n1. To make current arrow/compute/kernels/hash supporting received a memo_table as input, so multiple array will be able to get dictencode and valuecount based on same hashmap with a unified index.\n1. To add a split array function instead of using take multiple time to split one array to several ones.\n1. so the output array can use current funcs under compute/kernels, such as sum/count/sort to support group by.\n   \n   But this is some of my basic idea, wanna know if there is a on going plan on this?\u00a0\u00a0",
