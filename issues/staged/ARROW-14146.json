        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14146](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14146). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the script in `dev/merge_arrow_pr.py` requires modifying to run on any machines/environments where the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python` finds the system Python 2 instead of Python 3.\r\n\r\nUpdating the shebang line to read `python3` instead of `python` would fix this.\r\n\r\n`[~thisisnic]` \u00a0did the same for the linting and formatting scripts in\u00a0ARROW-13759. Perhaps it is not as important to do this for the merge script because there is a wrapper script `dev/merge_arrow_pr.sh` that creates a virtual env and runs the Python script in it, but some Arrow devs (I for one) call the Python script directly.",
