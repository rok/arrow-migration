However, I believe other built-in file implementations might also return an error status in Tell().",

I'll take a look; it's a bit harder to do so as I'm only implementing a subset of the FS interface, and we're writing prototype-quality code for now (plus we use a different build system). I'll try to split out patches from my project if possible though, and see if its useful to upstream."
