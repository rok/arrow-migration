Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNow `timeZoneList` in\u00a0`DateUtility` belongs to Joda time.\r\n\r\nSince we have replace Joda time with Java time in ARROW-2015, this should also be changed.\r\n\r\n`TimeStampXXTZVectors` have a timezone member which seems not used now and its `getObject` returns Long(different with that in `TimeStampXXVectors` which returns `LocalDateTime`), should it return `LocalDateTime` with its timezone?\r\n\r\nIs it reasonable if we do as follows:\r\n1. remove\u00a0Joda `timezoneList`\u00a0in `DateUtility`\n1. add method like\u00a0`getLocalDateTimeFromEpochMilli(long epochMillis, String timezone)` in DateUtility\n1. Not sure make `TimeStampXXTZVectors` return `LocalDateTime`\uff1f\n   \n   cc [~emkornfield@gmail.com]\u00a0 `[~bryanc]` \u00a0 `[~siddteotia]`",
