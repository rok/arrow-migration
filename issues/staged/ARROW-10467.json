Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'd like to propose the addition of the ability to pass arbitrary client properties to the server as headers in the RPC calls.\r\n\r\nThis would allow clients to pass additional context to the servers in an opt-in manner, using CallOptions in Java (to be replicated in the C++/Python clients).",
