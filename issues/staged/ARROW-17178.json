Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-16444 and ARROW-16703 we will have some arrow_dplyr_query objects whose pipeline can't contain `head()` after the part that calls R code. This is a very big feature not to support and we need to find a workaround. The full-on solution is to make sure that we support an R-level RecordBatchReader, but there may be a workaround that we can support in the meantime.",
