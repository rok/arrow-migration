Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, there is not a built-in mechanism to allow for data integrity checks for FlightData messages. This issue is to discuss and see if there may be a way to add this to Flight without making things more complicated for the non-checksummed use case",

Otherwise I agree with Antoine that it makes more sense as part of IPC."
