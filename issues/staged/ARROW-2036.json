Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf `NativeFile` supported most/all of the standard IOBase methods (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase),> then it'd be easier to use arrow files with other python libraries. Would at least be nice to support enough operations to use `io.TextIOWrapper`.",
