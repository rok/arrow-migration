Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`encoding.h` and `encoding.cc` are difficult to read and rewrite. I think there's also lost opportunities for more generic implementations. Simplify/winnow the interfaces while keeping an eye on the benchmarks for performance regressions",
