        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8160](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8160). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```\n\r\nC:/projects/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/flight_test.cc(1261): error: Value of: status.message()\r\nExpected: has substring \"Invalid token\"\r\n  Actual: \"Could not write record batch to stream: \"\r\n[  FAILED  ] TestBasicAuthHandler.FailUnauthenticatedCalls (17 ms)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because `Close()` calls `RecordBatchPayloadWriter::Close()`, which calls `CheckStarted`, which in turn tries to write data. If the data gets flushed and the server responds in time, we'll see a failure during writing, causing us to never check the server status (which is the last part of `DoPutPayloadWriter::Close`). We need to reliably check and expose the gRPC status.",
