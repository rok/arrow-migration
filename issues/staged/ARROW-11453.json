Reverting to 0.5.9 fixes the issue, but I am not sure what the cause is - posting this here in case there were filesystem changes in pyarrow recently which are incompatible with changes made in adlfs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n  File \"pyarrow/_dataset.pyx\", line 2343, in pyarrow._dataset._filesystemdataset_write\r\n  File \"pyarrow/_fs.pyx\", line 1032, in pyarrow._fs._cb_create_dir\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pyarrow/fs.py\", line 259, in create_dir\r\n    self.fs.mkdir(path, create_parents=recursive)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/fsspec/asyn.py\", line 121, in wrapper\r\n    return maybe_sync(func, self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/fsspec/asyn.py\", line 100, in maybe_sync\r\n    return sync(loop, func, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/fsspec/asyn.py\", line 71, in sync\r\n    raise exc.with_traceback(tb)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/fsspec/asyn.py\", line 55, in f\r\n    result[0] = await future\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/adlfs/spec.py\", line 1033, in _mkdir\r\n    raise FileExistsError(\r\nFileExistsError: Cannot overwrite existing Azure container -- dev already exists.  \r\n```\r\n",
