Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we simply uses Rust's native types as primitive types, and relies on macros such as [this](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/rust/src/array.rs#L298) to link the Arrow data type with the native type. A better approach may be to define richer primitive types which contain both the Arrow type and the Rust native type, as well as other information such as type's bit width, precision, etc.",
