Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be great to have a suite of relevant benchmarks for the Python serialization code in ARROW-759. These could be used to guide profiling and performance improvements.\n\nRelevant use cases include:\n- dictionaries of large numpy arrays that are used to represent weights of a neural network\n- long lists of primitive types like ints, floats or strings\n- lists of user defined python objects\n\n",
