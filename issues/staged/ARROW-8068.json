        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8068](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8068). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI ran into an esoteric situation in ARROW-8015 where I built the C++ library with all bundled dependencies including zlib. I then built a Python wheel, but the Python build failed when using `PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP=1` because it could not find `zlib.dll`. The failure points were both in CMakeLists.txt and in setup.py.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this situation will only arise esoterically, but we may want to add a flag to toggle off the zlib bundling behavior",
