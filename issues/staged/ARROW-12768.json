Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are special cases in arithmetic kernels with floating-point arguments that can result in signed values which are equivalent to their unsigned counterpart when compared with the equality operator. To make the comparisons correct, one needs to also compare the sign bit. For example,\u00a0**-0.0 == 0.0** is true while **std::signbit(-0.0) == std::signbit(0.0)** is false. This issue also applies to **Inf** and **NaN** values.",
