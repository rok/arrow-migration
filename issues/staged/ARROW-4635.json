Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nreAlloc method inside StructVector.java is growing validity buffer and growing capacity of children.\r\n\r\nWhen validity buffer already has enough capacity to accommodate new size of children, growing validity buffer can be avoided.\u00a0",

In allocateNewSafe()\r\n \\* Prior to my change, the FixedWidthVectors were allocating buffers equal to the last known size.\r\n \\* Post my change, the FixedWidthVectors are allocating buffers equal to the initial size (INITIAL_VALUE_ALLOCATION).\r\n\r\nSo, in a sequence of\r\n1. allocateNewSafe()\n1. reAlloc()\n1. reAlloc()\n1. allocateNewSafe()\n   \n   \u00a0\n   \n   Prior to my change, the 4th step would do an allocation of 4 \\*\u00a0 INITIAL_VALUE_ALLOCATION. Post my change, the 4th step does an allocation of\u00a0 INITIAL_VALUE_ALLOCATION.\n   \n   \u00a0\n   \n   This behavior is happening in the child vectors (i.e primitive vectors) but the complex vectors still have the old behavior, This mismatch is causing the bug."
