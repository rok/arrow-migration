Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in `BitVectorHelper.loadValidityBuffer`, we always allocate memory when the source vector contains only null or non-null values. However, as the format also allows allocating validity buffer even if all values are null or not-null, the method should also consider whether the input validity buffer is null or not, and avoiding allocating new buffer when it is latter.",
