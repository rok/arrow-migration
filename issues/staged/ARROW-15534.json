        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15534](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15534). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a follow-up to ARROW-15238\r\n\r\nThe current API for Substrait is:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nResult<std::vector<compute::Declaration>> DeserializePlan(\r\n    const Buffer&, const ConsumerFactory&, ExtensionSet* ext_set = NULLPTR)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis converts a plan into a vector of declarations (one per root-relation in the Substrait plan)\r\nThese declarations then have to be added to an exec plan to run.\r\n\r\nAs a convenience we could alter the API:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nResult<std::vector<compute::Declaration>> DeserializePlans(\r\n    const Buffer&, const ConsumerFactory&, ExtensionSet* ext_set = NULLPTR)\r\nresult<compute::ExecPlan> DeserializePlan(const Buffer&, const ConsumerFactory&, ExtensionSet* ext_set = NULLPTR)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would save the user from needing to create an empty exec plan (and it could return an error if the substrait plan had multiple root relations).",

It's not clear what the semantics of such a construct would be."
