Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've spent some time trying to figure out why this is, playing with different dependency orderings and file properties.\r\n\r\nI don't see why this command is fundamentally different from our Flatbuffers-generated files which are basically doing the same thing\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/dbi/hiveserver2/thrift/CMakeLists.txt#L65\r\n\r\nThe code to generate the Thrift bindings originally came from Impala so there might be some small bug. We could take a look if the bug is present in Impala (with Ninja) and see if not, see how what they have is different and if that will fix it",
