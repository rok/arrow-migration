        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9572](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9572). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-9086 enabled Gandiva in our Homebrew formula, but when I tried to add that to the official Homebrew formula at release time, it failed. See some discussion at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/58581, though unfortunately the build logs are gone. \r\n\r\nIt turns out that the testing that Homebrew does is more thorough than the install/audit we do in CI. See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/58581/checks?check_run_id=915732878 for example. They install, build the bottle, then remove all dependencies and reinstall the bottle. Since this failed, what I think it means is that `llvm` is not a build-only dependency for Gandiva--it built but couldn't run successfully because `llvm` had been removed.\r\n\r\ncc `[~kou]`",
