        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9542](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9542). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nResolveColumnsRule does not resolve columns for inputs to aggregate queries. This makes it impossible to apply a filter before an aggregate, for example.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple. The following code around line 52 ...\r\n```java\n\r\nLogicalPlanBuilder::from(input) \n```\r\nShould be ...\r\n```java\n\r\nLogicalPlanBuilder::from(&self.optimize(input.as_ref())? \n```\r\nIt looks like the same applies for Selection and we should review this carefully and add tests.",
