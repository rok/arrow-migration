Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nKeyError and AlreadyExists don't fully round-trip, instead becoming UNKNOWN. There are others, but we don't attempt to map all the Arrow status to a gRPC status, only the ones that closely correspond to a gRPC error.\u00a0",
