Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nopen_dataset() provides the very helpful optional argument to set unify_schemas=FALSE, which should allow arrow to inspect a single parquet file instead of touching potentially thousands or more parquet files to determine a consistent unified schema.\u00a0 This ought to provide a substantial performance increase in contexts where the schema is known in advance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in my tests it seems to have no impact on performance.\u00a0 Consider the following reprexes:\r\n\r\n\u00a0default, unify_schemas=TRUE\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nex <- s3_bucket(\"neon4cast-scores/parquet/terrestrial_30min\", endpoint_override = \"data.ecoforecast.org\", anonymous=TRUE)\r\nbench::bench_time(\r\n{ open_dataset(ex) }\r\n)\n```\r\nabout 32 seconds for me.\r\n\r\n\u00a0manual, unify_schemas=FALSE:\u00a0\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nbench::bench_time({\r\nopen_dataset(ex, unify_schemas = FALSE)\r\n})\n```\r\ntakes about 32 seconds as well.\u00a0",
