Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeveral pattern matches can be rewritten directly using a combinator on either `Option` or `Result`, in a\u00a0 manner similar to\u00a0[ARROW-7692]. The pattern-match equivalent often takes a lot more real estate ton convey the same meaning, especially since the combinators in question (`flat_map`, `map`, et al.) are defined in the same way across languages (Scala, Python ...).",
