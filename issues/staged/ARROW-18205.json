        "title": "[C++] Substrait consumer is not converting right side references correctly on joins",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18205](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18205). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Substrait plan expresses a join condition as a logical expression like:\r\n\r\n`field(0) == field(3)` where `0` and `3` are indices into the **combined** schema.  These are then passed down to Acero which expects:\r\n\r\n`HashJoinNodeOptions(std::vector<FieldRef> in_left_keys, std::vector<FieldRef> in_right_keys)`\r\n\r\nHowever, `in_left_keys` are field references into the **left** schema and `in_right_keys` are field references into the **right** schema.\r\n\r\nIn other words, given the above expression (`field(0) == field(3)` if the schema were:\r\n\r\nleft:\r\n  key: int32\r\n  y: int32\r\n  z: int32\r\n\r\nright:\r\n  key: int32\r\n  x: int32\r\n\r\nThen `in_left_keys` should be `field(0)` (works correct today) and `in_right_keys` should be `field(0)` (today we are sending in `field(3)`).",
