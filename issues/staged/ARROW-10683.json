        "title": "[Rust] Remove Array.data method in favor of .data_ref to make performance impact of clone more obvious",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10683](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10683). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `Array.data()` method is a real performance foot-gun since it involves cloning an `Arc` which is not obvious to users. When used in innner loops that can cause big performance impacts. The cloning itself might not be a problem, but I think it sometimes prohibits other compiler optimizations.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to remove this method and let users call `array_ref()` and only clone when really needed.\r\n\r\nMost of the current usages seem to be in test assertions which should be easy to refactor.\r\n\r\n",

My rationale was that removing the method without renaming would give a better error message for external users upgrading to a new version."
