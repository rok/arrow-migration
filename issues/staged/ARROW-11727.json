        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11727](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11727). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn Flight benchmark, boost accumulator is used to estimate latency quantiles (0.5, 0.95, 0.99). Internally, boost adopts P-Square algorithm [1]. P-Square is very bad at estimating skewed quantiles like 0.99, where TDigest shines.\r\n\r\nTest result shows 0.99 latency is much better than what current code tells us. We should switch to TDigest.\r\n - run flight-benchmark with default parameters\r\n - calculate 0.99 quantile of latencies\r\n - compare exact value (store all data points), value from tdigest, and value from boost\r\n - test 5 rounds\r\n```\n\r\nExact Tdigest Boost-P2\r\n86    93      2130\r\n175   235     1526\r\n151   165     1926\r\n147   153     302\r\n251   313     561\r\n```\r\n\r\nTDigest gives more accurate values for all quantiles. For 0.5 quantiles, both TDigest and Boost gives very accurate result. For 0.95 quantiles, TDigest gives almost exact value, Boost has a bit deviation.\r\n\r\n[1] <https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/papers/ftp/psqr.pdf>",
