        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10333](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10333). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe\u00a0 java package (org.apache.arrow.util) is provided in two different artifacts\r\n \\* arrow-memory-core: ([Link to GitHub](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/java/memory/memory-core/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/util))\r\n \\* arrow-vectors: ([Link to GitHub](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/util))\r\nThis is causing trouble when using OSGI dependency management. After converting the maven artifacts to OSGI bundles the package is available via two chains (which is not allowed).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Java 9+ module system (JPMS) does not allow for split packages either. See [here](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/core-java-tutorial/modules/split-packages.html).\r\n\r\nThis was mentioned in the [mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r750c627757a7d6739651a73bd51c36fc9ade7c819eb509ed99fd03c0%40%3Cuser.arrow.apache.org%3E).\r\n\r\nPossible solutions are:\r\n- Renaming the packages to `org.apache.arrow.vector.util` and `org.apache.arrow.memory.util`\n- Moving the classes from vector to memory-core",
