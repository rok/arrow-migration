Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`copy_files()` is a pretty handy function for working between local and remote interfaces, particularly for any file type arrow doesn't handle (arvo, ncdf, h5, etc etc).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems to work only from directory-to-directory, at least in the direction of copying S3 -> local file system.\u00a0 e.g. this reprex:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nlocal_dir <- tempfile()\r\nfs::dir_delete(local_dir)\r\nfs::dir_create(local_dir) # create dir if it doesn't exist\r\nl3 <- SubTreeFileSystem$create(local_dir)\r\nl3$ls() #empty\r\n\r\ns3 <- s3_bucket(\"neon4cast-targets/aquatics\", endpoint_override = \"data.ecoforecast.org\", anonymous=TRUE)\r\ns3$ls() #not empty, good\r\n\r\ncopy_files(s3$path(\"aquatics-targets.csv.gz\"), l3$path(\"aquatics-targets.csv.gz\"))\r\nl3$ls() # darn, nothing!\r\n\r\ncopy_files(s3$path(\"aquatics-targets.csv.gz\"), l3)\r\nl3$ls() # darn, nothing!\r\n\r\ncopy_files(s3, l3)\r\nl3$ls() \u00a0# Finally! only this works\r\n```",
