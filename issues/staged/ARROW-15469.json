What OS are you on and how did you install Python?\r\n\r\nIt looks like you are specifying the path the executable and that is working. However, it looks like it's missing numpy (`pip install numpy`) and the Python development libraries (usually called `python-devel` or `python-dev` in most linux package managers). If you install both of those that should fix that error."

Unclear if that will work if the library files are empty.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, it might be worth taking a look at our manywheel dockerfile here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/docker/python-wheel-manylinux-201x.dockerfile#L86-L89"
