Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe recently moved Dremio to LE Decimal format (similar to Arrow). As part of that we introduces some APIs in decimal vector which take a big endian data and swap the bytes while writing into the ArrowBuf of decimal vector.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of these APIs is that caller would not have to allocate an additional memory and write( and read) source big endian twice for swapping into new memory and using that to write into the vector.\r\n\r\nWe can directly swap bytes while writing into the vector \u2013 just read once and swap while writing.",
