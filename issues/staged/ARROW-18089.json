        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18089](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18089). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\nu <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/arrow/master/r/inst/v0.7.1.parquet\"\r\nread_parquet(u)\r\n# Error: file must be a \"RandomAccessFile\"\r\nread_parquet(url(u))\r\n# Error: file must be a \"RandomAccessFile\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that urls get turned into InputStream by `make_readable_file`, and parquet requires RandomAccessFile. \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\narrow:::make_readable_file(u)\r\n# InputStream\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two relevant codepaths in make_readable_file: if given a string URL, it tries `FileSystem$from_uri()` and falls back to `MakeRConnectionInputStream`, which returns InputStream not RandomAccessFile. If provided a connection object (i.e. `url(u)`), it tries MakeRConnectionRandomAccessFile first and falls back to MakeRConnectionInputStream. If you provide a `url()` it does fall back to InputStream: \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\narrow:::MakeRConnectionRandomAccessFile(url(u))\r\n# Error: Tell() returned an error\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we truly can't work with a HTTP URL in read_parquet, we should at least document that. We could also do the workaround of downloading to a tempfile first.",
