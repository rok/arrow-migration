Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAnother thing to do is to change the signagure of LogicalPlanBuilder\r\nfrom taking slices of owned things &[Expr] to just taking Vec<Expr> entirely \r\n\r\nThe rationale is that at all callsites you need to have an owned vec and Datafusion is going to copy anyways, so it would better to allow the caller to give up ownership",
