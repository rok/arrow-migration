Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCompute layer describes ternary functions but the scalar API is missing support for this. Specifically, generator dispatchers and structs with ternary-based\u00a0**Exec** methods. Refer to [\u00a0](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/api_scalar.cc) <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/codegen_internal.h> and <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/scalar_arithmetic.cc>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[This `Between` kernel PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11882) adds some of the ternary functionalities.",

The only one that comes to mind is multiply-accumulate (aka fused-multiply add). Actually, now that I know more of Arrow's codebase, the missing support is not in **api_scalar.cc** but rather in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/codegen_internal.h> and <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/scalar_arithmetic.cc> where there are no generator dispatchers for ternary functions nor structs with ternary-based **Exec** methods.\r\n\r\nI encountered a similar situation when adding the first scalar unary arithmetic function, **negate**, and added this support in the same PR. If you think that this Jira is not meaningful and it is better to let the ternary support be added along with its corresponding functions/kernels, then we can remove it."

No, I think it would be useful to have such helpers and we can keep this open, I just wanted to double-check what exactly was missing here.\r\n\r\nThough as you point out, there are relatively few of these and so they may end up being just done ad-hoc."
