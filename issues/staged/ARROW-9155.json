        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9155](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9155). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe default settings for \"archery benchmark\" in my opinion are a bit too exhaustive in their attempt to produce high precision numbers. I suggest that the default sacrifice precision for speed, while leaving the \"neurotic\" / high-precision mode as something that users can opt in to. \r\n\r\nThis would ease interactive use for developers",
