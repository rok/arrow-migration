Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello again! I have another minor R arrow issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe `ParquetFileWriter` docs say that the `sink` argument can be a \"string which is interpreted as a file path\". However, when I try to use a string, I get a segfault because the memory isn't mapped.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMaybe this is a separate request, but it would also be helpful to have documentation for the methods of the writer created by `ParquetFileWriter$create()`.\r\n\r\nDocs link: <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/ParquetFileWriter.html>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\n\r\nsch = schema(a = float32())\r\nwriter = ParquetFileWriter$create(schema = sch, sink = \"test.parquet\")\r\n\r\n#> *** caught segfault ***\r\n#> address 0x14100007d, cause 'memory not mapped'\r\n#> \r\n#> Traceback:\r\n#> 1: parquet___arrow___ParquetFileWriter__Open(schema, sink, properties,     arrow_properties)\r\n#> 2: shared_ptr_is_null(xp)\r\n#> 3: shared_ptr(ParquetFileWriter, parquet___arrow___ParquetFileWriter__Open(schema,     sink, properties, arrow_properties))\r\n#> 4: ParquetFileWriter$create(schema = sch, sink = \"test.parquet\")\r\n\r\n\r\n# This works as expected:\r\nsink = FileOutputStream$create(\"test.parquet\")\r\nwriter = ParquetFileWriter$create(schema = sch, sink = sink)\r\n```",

Would you be interested in submitting a PR to fix that? Could also add in brief docstrings for ParquetFileWriter's two methods while you're there, it's all within the same 10 lines of parquet.R."
