Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm running into various exceptions (often: \"Invalid flatbuffers message\") when attempting to de-serialize RecordBatch's in Python that were generated in C++.\r\n\r\nThe same batch can be de-serialized back within C++.\r\n\r\n**Example (C++)** (status checks omitted, but they are check in real code)**:**\r\n```java\n\r\nconst auto stream = arrow::io::BufferOutputStream::Create();\r\n\r\n{\r\n  const auto writer = arrow::ipc::MakeStreamWriter(*stream, schema);\r\n  const auto writeRes = (*writer)->WriteRecordBatch(batch);\r\n  (*writer)->Close();\r\n}\r\n\r\nauto buffer = (*stream)->Finish();\r\n\r\nstd::ofstream ofs(\"record-batch-large.arrow\"); // we'll read this in Python\r\nofs.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>((*buffer)->data()), (*buffer)->size());\r\nofs.close();\r\n\r\nauto backAgain = DeserializeRecordBatch((*buffer)); // all good\r\n```\r\n**Then in Python**:\r\n```java\n\r\nwith open(\"record-batch-large.arrow\", \"rb\") as f:\r\n\tdata = f.read()\r\n\r\nreader = pa.RecordBatchStreamReader(data) // throws here - \"Invalid flatbuffers message\"\r\n```\r\nPlease see the attached .arrow file (produced above).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?",
