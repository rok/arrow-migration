        "title": "[PYTHON] Remove index column from subschema in write_to_dataframe",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4538](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4538). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen using `pa.Table.from_pandas()` with preserve_index=True and dataframe.index.name!=None the prefix `__index_level_` is not added to the respective schema name. This breaks `write_to_dataset` with active partition columns.\r\n```Java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\r\nimport os\r\nimport shutil\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nPATH_PYARROW_MANUAL = '/tmp/pyarrow_manual.pa/'\r\n\r\nif os.path.exists(PATH_PYARROW_MANUAL):\r\n    shutil.rmtree(PATH_PYARROW_MANUAL)\r\nos.mkdir(PATH_PYARROW_MANUAL)\r\n\r\narrays = np.array([np.array([0, 1, 2]), np.array([3, 4]), np.nan, np.nan])\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame([0, 0, 1, 1], columns=['partition_column'])\r\ndf['arrays'] = pd.Series(arrays)\r\n\r\ndf.index.name='ID'\r\n\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df, preserve_index=True)\r\nprint(table.schema.names)\r\n\r\npq.write_to_dataset(table, root_path=PATH_PYARROW_MANUAL, \r\n                    partition_cols=['partition_column'],\r\n                    preserve_index=True\r\n                   )\r\n```\r\nRemoving `df.index.name='ID'` works. Also disabling `partition_cols` in `write_to_dataset` works.",

Hence we should remove the schema for index columns in `write_to_dataset`. I have a working version and will create a pull request in github.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nPR on [github](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3744)\r\n\r\n\u00a0"

I don't think we should attempt to preserve pandas indexes through `write_to_dataset`. I'll comment in the PR I'm about to put up"
