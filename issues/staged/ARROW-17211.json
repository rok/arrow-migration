Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[ARROW-16943] added clean up to `java_full_build.sh` to fix issues with multiple jars when the job was run on a self-hosted (aka non-ephemeral) runner. This does fails when `.~/m2` does not exists.\r\n\r\nI marked this as a blocker because this prevents us from building the release Jars.\r\ncc: `[~kszucs]` `[~raulcd]`",
