        "title": "[Rust]: SIMD implementation of arithmetic kernels reads out of bounds",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10914](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10914). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe simd arithmetic kernels use the following pattern repeatedly:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n    for i in (0..left.len()).step_by(lanes) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf len is not a multiple of the number of lanes, this would read out of bounds in the last iteration. Currently, all buffers have an additional padding of 64 bytes (equal to the simd width), which masks this problem in most tests. As soon as we use a slice of an array, it should however be reproducible even with this padding.\r\n\r\nEven without a crash, the issue is detectable with valgrind:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n==31106== Invalid read of size 32\r\n==31106==    at 0x1ECEE1: arrow::compute::kernels::arithmetic::add::hfded8b2c06cf22de (in /home/joernhorstmann/Source/github/apache/arrow/rust/target/release/deps/arrow-205580f93d58d5a9)\r\n==31106==    by 0x2650EF: arrow::compute::kernels::arithmetic::tests::test_arithmetic_kernel_should_not_rely_on_padding::hacb7c7921dc38e6a (in /home/joernhorstmann/Source/github/apache/arrow/rust/target/release/deps/arrow-205580f93d58d5a9)\r\n```",
