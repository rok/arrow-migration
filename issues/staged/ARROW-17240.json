        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17240](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17240). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed during the Release of the 9.0.0 Release the binary verification tasks are not exercised on a nightly basis. This caused some required fixes for the Release which should have been caught prior to the release.\r\n\r\nLink to the relevant [discussion on Zulip](https://ursalabs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/180245-dev/topic/Release.209.2E0.2E0.20status/near/291181703)\r\n\r\nWe have to take into account that we would need to download the binaries from crossbow instead of artifactory and only trigger the verification tasks after the binaries build tasks have finished.",
