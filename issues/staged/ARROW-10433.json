But do you have an example failure? Because we are actually testing (or should be testing) with s3fs, and so I find it strange that our tests are then not failing .."

The change is that fsspec stopped subclassing pyarrow.filesystem.FileSystem when pyarrow >= 2.0 is installed (because we now better handle fsspec filesystems, and because pyarrow.filesystem is deprecated). \r\n\r\nBut so the code path that you are moving in the PR only occurs when the passed filesystem is _not_ a pyarrow filesystem subclass. So in pyarrow 1.0 (where fsspec-based filesystems subclassed pyarrow), this code was never run in practice ..\r\n\r\nStill trying to see where this is not covered by our tests, though .."

I am adding a bunch in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8573. There is another problem related to nested directories that causes failing tests, but the `test_read_directory_s3fs` added in that PR should be fixed by your PR."
