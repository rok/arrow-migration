Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing a dataset with hive_style = TRUE, now the default, that dataset has to be opened without an explicit definition of the partitions to work as expected. Even if the correct partition is specified, any query to the dataset on the partition field returns 0 rows.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFrom my eyes as a user, I'd want this to error out specifically (not just warn), probably when first calling open_dataset().\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\ndata(\"mtcars\")\r\narrow::write_dataset(\r\n    dataset = mtcars, path = \"mtcarstest\", partitioning = \"cyl\",\r\n    format = \"parquet\", hive_style = TRUE)\r\n\r\nmtc1 <- arrow::open_dataset(\"mtcarstest\", partitioning = \"cyl\")\r\nmtc2 <- arrow::open_dataset(\"mtcarstest\")\r\n\r\nmtc1 %>%\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 dplyr::filter(cyl == 4) %>%\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 collect()\r\n\r\nmtc2 %>%\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 dplyr::filter(cyl == 4) %>%\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 collect()\r\n\r\n \n```",

When reading with a **directory** partitioning (which what results when a character vector is specified), this results in string values like \"cyl=4\" for field \"cyl\"; obviously suspect to a human but technically valid. If you construct a `HivePartitioning` explicitly this issue should not arise\r\n\u00a0"

It's not unreasonable to expect that `open_dataset(\"mtcarstest\", partitioning = \"cyl\")` should do the right thing if the column name matches the hive key. As it turns out, that's not so trivial, and supporting that introduces some other API ambiguities. We'll need to think about this some more."
