        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8265](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8265). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Table API requires the context to be passed into the collect() method which leads to this odd code.\r\n```java\n\r\nlet results = ctx.table(\"alltypes_plain\")?\r\n    .filter(col(\"c12\").gt(&lit_f64(0.5)))?\r\n    .aggregate(vec![col(\"c1\")], vec![min(col(\"c12\"))])?\r\n    .collect(&mut ctx, 1024)?; \n```\r\nSince the table comes from the context, it should not be necessary to pass the context back in.",
