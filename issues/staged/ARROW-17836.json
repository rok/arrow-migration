The task is to augment MemoryPool to allow for specifying alignment explicitly when allocating (but keep the default the same).",

The difference with spilling is that we are already doing a memcpy higher up in the chain.  When we spill, we take the data we need to spill and partition it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we want to add spill to sorting, and we pretend we are sorting by date, and we've accumulated too much data we might then partition into decade sized buckets and persist to disk.  Then, once all the data has arrived, we can process a single decade at a time (with the hope that one decade of data is small enough to fit in memory).\r\n\r\nThat's a rough description, and there are corner cases, but the point is we already have to do a memcpy in order to handle the partitioning (partitioning is unfortunately a rather row-oriented operation) and so we want to go ahead and satisfy the alignment requirement at that point.  This way, when we are ready to spill, we don't have to worry about alignment and we can just use direct I/O without any extra memcpy."
