        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-378](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-378). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we convert columns irrespectively of their timezone directly to timestamps in Arrow. While in Pandas you are able to specify timezones, in Arrow we have the assumptions that a Timestamp is always the time of the specified unit since 00:00:00.000 on 1 January 1970, UTC. Thus we have to check if `df['column\u2018].tz`\u00a0is set and convert if necessary to UTC before converting to an Arrow column. ",

I'm happy to do so, but please consider taking the current pull request as this 'implicit conversion' to UTC by numpy is documented and explicitly tested.  It may help others in the future avoid being fooled in a similar manner.  :)"
