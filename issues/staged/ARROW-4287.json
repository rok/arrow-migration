Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThrift currently just uses the first bison it finds but needs actually a newer one. We should look for the minimal version required and fall back explicitly to homebrew and use the newer version if it is available there.\r\n\r\nNote: I'll add a fix in our CMake toolchain but will also try to upstream this to Thrift.",
