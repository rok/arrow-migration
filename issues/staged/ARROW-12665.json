The arrow version 4.0.0 binary packages for macOS that are currently on CRAN have two capabilities disabled (Datasets and Parquet). We are working quickly to fix this. We hope to have a new version of the arrow R package on CRAN in\u00a0the next few days. In the meantime, two possible workarounds for macOS users are:\r\n - Install from source:\r\n`install.packages(\"arrow\", type = \"source\")`\r\n \u00a0\r\n - Install a nightly build:\r\n `install.packages(\"arrow\", repos = \"https://arrow-r-nightly.s3.amazonaws.com\")`"
