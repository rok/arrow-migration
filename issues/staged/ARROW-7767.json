Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a special case for R and other cases where the null value is represented by a sentinel. This would read the data pointer and return a null bitmap buffer where bits are activate for every row where the value is not the sentinel value. If no sentinel is encountered, return nullptr. \r\n\r\n\r\n```c++\n\r\ntemplate <typename ArrowType, typename CType = ArrowType::c_type>\r\nResult<std::shared_ptr<Buffer>> NullBitmapFromSentinelData(MemoryPool* pool, const CType* data, size_t n_values, CType sentinel_value);\r\n```\r\n",
