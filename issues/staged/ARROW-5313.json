Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently Schema.fbs has two different explanations of `Field.children`\r\n\r\nOne says \"children is only for nested Arrow arrays\" and the other says \"children apply only to nested data types like Struct, List and Union\". I think both are technically correct but the latter is much more explicit, we should remove the former.",
