        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13435). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the arrow R package, there is a function `record_batch()` that is an alias for `RecordBatch$create()`. It would be nice to have a similar friendly alias for the even more commonly used `Table$create()`. Obviously we can't use `table()`\u00a0for this, but how about `arrow_table()`?",

For historical context, the constructor used to be called `table` (and there was also `array`), which led to annoying packageStartupMessages."

For that reason alone I think this is worth it."
