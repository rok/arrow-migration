        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4457](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4457). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere appears to have been a regression introduced in 0.11.0 such that we can no longer create a `Decimal128` array using integers.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pyarrow\r\ncolumn = pyarrow.decimal128(16, 4)\r\narray = pyarrow.array([1], column)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected result: Behavior same as 0.10.0 and earlier; a `Decimal128` array would be created with no problems.\r\n\r\nActual result: an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 175, in pyarrow.lib.array\r\n    return _sequence_to_array(obj, mask, size, type, pool, from_pandas)\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 36, in pyarrow.lib._sequence_to_array\r\n    check_status(ConvertPySequence(sequence, mask, options, &out))\r\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 81, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\n    raise ArrowInvalid(message)\r\nArrowInvalid: Could not convert 1 with type int: converting to Decimal128\r\nCould not convert 1 with type int: converting to Decimal128\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe crash doesn't occur if we use a `decimal.Decimal` object instead.",
