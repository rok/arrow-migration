Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp> is a neat single-header library which allows capture of very expressive stack traces. It is compatible with c++11 and is cross platform, I think it would greatly improve error reporting in arrow.\r\n\r\n![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bombela/backward-cpp/master/doc/pretty.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bombela/backward-cpp/master/doc/pretty.png)\r\n\r\nIn particular, the stack traces provided by a failed DCHECK are much less expressive than they could be and don't include file/line information, while the traces added to statuses by `ARROW_EXTRA_ERROR_CONTEXT` don't include the frame in which the status was constructed- which is frequently the frame which we most need information from. Backward addresses these shortcomings and then some.",
