        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1647](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1647). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we write the \"length\" field, it is an `int64_t`. See https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/dc129d60fbffbf3a5b71b1f7987f7dab948b3d61/cpp/src/plasma/io.cc#L63.\n\nHowever, when we read the \"length\" field, it is a `size_t`. See https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/dc129d60fbffbf3a5b71b1f7987f7dab948b3d61/cpp/src/plasma/io.cc#L98.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug, but it looks like it might be. And I suspect there is an issue somewhere in this area because a couple Ray users on non-standard platforms have reported issues with a check failure at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/dc129d60fbffbf3a5b71b1f7987f7dab948b3d61/cpp/src/plasma/io.cc#L94.\n\nSee https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/1008.",
