Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere's a list of \"common\" error codes we should handle: <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html#error-handling>\r\n\r\nWe should also try to refactor common utilities out of the individual transports (at least as much as reasonably possible). We should also introduce a common test.",
