On those cases we should use the URL we used to use before ARROW-18028 was merged:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18028\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/1e481b5d6dc6537e1994a4ff03334e95c7cfca93>\r\n\r\nOn the case of GitHub:\r\n```java\n\r\nhttps://github.com/{repo}/actions?query=branch:{branch} \n```",

We can't find the task URL from the page...\r\n\r\nBTW, I think that the current URL isn't so bad. We can go to the task URL with 2 clicks: \u2713 -> Details\r\nSee also: ![task-url-link.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13051101/task-url-link.png) "
