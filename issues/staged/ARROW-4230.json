Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now Flight assumes that gRPC is vendored or that it is installed with CMake. It would be easier to build if it accepted other installations of gRPC, such as ones from Conda (eventually) or system package managers.",
