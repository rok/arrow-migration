Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLinked issues:\r\n \\* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14663\u00a0- discussion on exposing the number of threads to the read and write CSV functionality in R.\r\n \\* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14702\u00a0- issue on improving the C++ documentation on how Arrow does multithreading. We should link to these docs from the R side.\u00a0\r\n\r\n> We should probably add details to the read_csv_arrow documentation linking to cpu_count()/set_cpu_count as the way to control multi-threading. And possibly refine the documentation about the others (or set them to keywords-internal if we don't expect users to need to or want to set them).",
