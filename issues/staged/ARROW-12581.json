        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12581](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12581). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFlight benchmark program is using random test data as payload. Random data is hard to compress. Per my test, the compressed payload (zstd default level) is actually a bit larger than the original uncompressed payload. So compression is a pure loss in current benchmark.\r\n\r\nIt's better to use real world test set for a more reasonable benchmark about how compression influences FlightRPC performance. Perhaps the benchmark (both client/server) could accept a path to an IPC file as an option.",
