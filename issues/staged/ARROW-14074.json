Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-14062 adds a basic compute Intermediate Representation. Allowing c++ compute to consume this and produce ExecPlans will allow more straightforward and less tightly coupled usage of ExecPlans from bindings.",
