Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nChange the wording of the intro sentence of the **Class Structure and Package Conventions** section in the Arrow vignette. https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/arrow.html#class-structure-and-package-conventions.\r\nI think the confusion stems from both **R6** and **reference classes** being OOP paradigms in R.",
