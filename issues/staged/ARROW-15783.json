Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInitPandasStaticData is only called on python/pandas -> Arrow and not the reverse path\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis causes the DCHECK to make sure the Pandas type is not null to fail if import code is never used.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA workaround to users of the library is to call pa.array([1]) which would avoid this issue.",
