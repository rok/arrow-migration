And if so, what are some of the details I should consider while implementing it?\r\n\r\nThanks."

Given that the AWS SDK has lots of proxy options, perhaps it would be nice to put them in a nested struct, e.g.:\r\n```c++\n\r\nstruct {\r\n  std::string scheme;\r\n  std::string host;\r\n  int port;\r\n  std::string username;\r\n  std::string password;\r\n} proxy_options;\r\n```\r\n"
