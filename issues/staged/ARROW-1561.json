Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nisin determines whether each element in the left array is contained in the values in the right array. This function must handle the case where the right array has nulls (so that null in the left array will return true)\n\n```Java\nisin(['a', 'b', null], ['a', 'c'])\nreturns [true, false, null]\n\nisin(['a', 'b', null], ['a', 'c', null])\nreturns [true, false, true]\n```\n\nMay need an option to return false for null instead of null",
