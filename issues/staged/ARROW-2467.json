Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGenerate flatbuffers code for Schema, File, Message, and Tensor and add to project. It would be nice to generate on the fly as part of the build process but this doesn't seem feasible today because:\r\n \\* We would have to download and compile Flatbuffers first\r\n \\* The Rust implementation of Flatbuffers has a couple minor issues that required manually fixing the generated code",
