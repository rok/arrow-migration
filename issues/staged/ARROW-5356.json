Looking into the code, it seems that the Duration type is only partially implemented in javascript/typescript. For example, it fails to decode the duration type because it is missing in this switch case: \u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-9.0.0.dev/js/src/ipc/metadata/message.ts#L440>\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is intentional, a bug, or just not implemented yet?"
