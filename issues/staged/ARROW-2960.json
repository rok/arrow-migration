Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe binary package verification function isn't correct, as it is not downloading packages and associated checksums and signatures at all.\r\n\r\nWe also need to set `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` in the source release creation script because cmake uses `lib64` instead of `lib` (and the script assumes `lib`) on platforms whose install libdir it doesn't know about a priori.",
