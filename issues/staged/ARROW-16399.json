Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12536> I found that locales other than \"C\" and \"POSIX\" didn't seem to be supported in the RTools environment (a MSYS2 fork). I saw some indications this might apply to any MINGW toolchain (https://stackoverflow.com/a/4497266/2048858), but nothing very recent or definitive.\r\n\r\nIs there a way we can enable this support?",

IIRC, this will error in C++:\r\n\r\n```C++\n\r\nstd::locale(\"English_United States.1252\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like it may be possible get support for other locales, based on the documentation here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/msys2/msys2-runtime/blob/c0250d576e39d603248d10e7bb2f396c9bc6a56c/newlib/libc/locale/locale.c#L29-L41"
