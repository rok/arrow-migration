        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5211](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5211). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFirst time throwing up an issue here so let me know if there's anything I missed / more details I can provide.\r\n\r\nJust going through the arrow documentation at\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/>\u00a0and I noticed that there's a section that is currently blank.\u00a0From what I can tell the section\u00a0<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Metadata.html#dictionary-encoding>\u00a0currently contains nothing in it. Is that intended? It\u00a0was confusing\u00a0to see a blank section, but that is just my opinion so it may not be worth changing.\r\n\r\nIf this is something work fixing / improving, then it's probably worth either filling out that section or simply removing header to avoid future confusion.",
