If I understand correctly Pandas and R/lubridate both infer a format on a subset of rows and use that format to parse the rest. Perhaps we can directly use that logic for now (I believe this was `[~dragosmg]`'s idea too) and see if we actually need this in C++?"

While convenient for users, the maintenance burden can be quite significant since inference tends to have an indefinite scope, leading to more custom logic, edge cases, etc"

Same for lubridate in R."
