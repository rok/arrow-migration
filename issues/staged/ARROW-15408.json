Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn Python, there is a [`log_memory_allocations` function](https://github.com/wesm/arrow/blob/33111644be84f84ce4601889fee06c6d17f05279/python/pyarrow/memory.pxi#L63) to change to use the LoggingMemoryPool. It would be nice to be able to do this in C++ and one very convenient way would be through an environment variable, since we already support `ARROW_DEFAULT_MEMORY_POOL`. Should probably be named something like `ARROW_LOG_MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS`.",
