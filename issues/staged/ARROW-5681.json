Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of requiring users to catch/throw StatusRuntimeException in Flight services/clients, and thereby leaking gRPC details, we should provide our own set of exceptions and status codes. This way, services can provide proper error messages and error codes to clients, which can catch the exception and respond properly.",
