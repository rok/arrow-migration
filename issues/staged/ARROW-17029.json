Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTopics I can think of right now:\r\n \\* introducing some utility functions for working with RLE data that I'm collecting currently as rle_util.h on my filter branch\r\n \\* how physical/logical indices work, especially in combination with arrow offsets\r\n \\* how common kinds of kernels can be converted to RLE. E.g scalar kernels with a single input could automatically be run on the internal data array of RLE. Scalar with multiple inputs and some kinds of vector algorithms should use VisitMergedRuns...",
