I'm replacing it with the \"official\" way to find TensorFlow as of <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#approximating-importlib-import-module.>\r\n\r\nThat should make the workaround work iff \"import tensorflow\" works (on systems that support importlib etc.\". On Python 2 we will fall back to \"import tensorflow\"."
