        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11645](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11645). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe DataType interval is currently implemented as a i32 or i64. However, that is incorrect and does not follow the spec.\r\n```java\n\r\n// DAY_TIME - Indicates the number of elapsed days and milliseconds,\r\n//   stored as 2 contiguous 32-bit integers (8-bytes in total).  Support\r\n//   of this IntervalUnit is not required for full arrow compatibility.\r\n```\r\nSee <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Schema.fbs>\r\n\r\nE.g. I think that IntervalDayTimeType should be a `struct(i32,i32)` with a C representation or something, which is how it is defined in the spec.\r\n\r\nThis would also make it easier to read from and write to, as we do not need to transmute or bitmask the values to get the correct values.",
