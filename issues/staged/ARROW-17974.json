        "title": "[C++] random function can't actually be used",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17974](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17974). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nrandom() is currently implemented as a nullary function. It doesn't let you specify the number of values you want to generate because it's designed to generate however many the given ExecBatch has. The only option RandomOptions takes seems to be an optional seed value. Unfortunately, the result is that the function is not usable, AFAICT.\r\n\r\nCalling the compute function directly, you get 0 values (all examples from R): \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\ncall_function(\"random\")\r\n# Array\r\n# <double>\r\n# []\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling it from within an ExecPlan, it errors because it is not a proper scalar function, despite what the filenames say (scalar_random.cc, etc.):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\nmtcars %>% \r\n  arrow_table() %>% \r\n  mutate(x = arrow_random()) %>% \r\n  collect()\r\n# Error in `collect()`:\r\n# ! Invalid: ExecuteScalarExpression cannot Execute non-scalar expression Array[double]\r\n```\r\n",
