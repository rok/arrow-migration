        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6653](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6653). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/7bb9e646832390d207393f064d7934e54c6cb010e30ea9f39f3ed1ce@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nI frequently do the following little bit bothersome steps for opening\r\nJIRA tickets when I watch a GitHub pull-request:\r\n\r\n1. Select the \"ARROW-XXXX\" text in the title and copy it\r\n2. Open JIRA if I haven't open it\r\n3. Select a ticket to open it\r\n4. Alter the URL by pasting text that copied at the step-1\r\n5. Hit the enter key\r\n\r\nI think it is better if these steps become easier.\r\n\r\nWe already have a mechanism to inject a GitHub pull-request URL into\r\nthe corresponding JIRA ticket. How about making the similar mechanism\r\nfor the reverse link?  I guess it is possible to automate making a\r\ncomment of JIRA ticket URL to the pull-request when the \"ARROW-XXXX\"\r\ntext is injected in the title field by using GitHub Actions.",
