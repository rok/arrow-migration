        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15764](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15764). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nListFlights serializes flights each time it is called. If we have many flights and ListFlights is called often this can produce a significant load on the server. We could have an optional cache server side to avoid this.",
