Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTest scenario :\r\n\r\nI read the same attched csv file in pandas and pyarrow to make a comparison,\r\n1. With pandas it reads it into a df without problems and result is as follows:\n   ```java\n   \n   import pandas as pd\n   \n   df = pd.read_csv('test.csv', names=['col1', 'col2', 'col3', 'col4', 'col5','col6'])\n   \n   >>df\n          col1   col2    col3  col4  col5  col6\n   0  20210317  julie   23434  test  data   1.0\n   1  20210316   adam  232423  test   NaN   NaN\n   ```\n   \n   \u00a02.\u00a0 With pyarrow csv, I get a parse error:\n   ```java\n   \n   from pyarrow import csv\n   import pyarrow as pa\n   \n   read_options = csv.ReadOptions(column_names=['col1', 'col2', 'col3', 'col4', 'col5', 'col6'])\n   convert_options = csv.ConvertOptions(column_types=pa.schema(fields))\n   table = csv.read_csv('test.csv', read_options=read_options,                     convert_options=convert_options)\n   \n   ERROR:\n   \n   Traceback (most recent call last):\n     File \".../test_pyarr.py\", line 71, in <module>\n       table = csv.read_csv('test.csv',\n     File \"pyarrow/_csv.pyx\", line 714, in pyarrow._csv.read_csv\n     File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 122, in pyarrow.lib.pyarrow_internal_check_status\n     File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 84, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\n   pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: CSV parse error: Expected 6 columns, got 4\n   ```\n   Is there a parameter that can be set to fill null values in case the column values are missing for the specified schema?",

It would probably be doable to add one, but would add non-trivial complexity to the CSV reader, so I'm rather reluctant. Which source is the data coming from?"

How do we know? Generally, it's not a good idea to let errors pass silently.\r\n\r\nIn any case, as I said, this would add complication in the core of the CSV reader, which is why it hasn't been done (yet?)."
