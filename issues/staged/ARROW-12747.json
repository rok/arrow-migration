Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow vector library depends on netty, which throws the exception\u00a0**java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: sun.misc.Unsafe or java.nio.DirectByteBuffer.(long, int) not available.**\u00a0In the documentation, [it's stated that s](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/README.md)etting\u00a0\"-Dio.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true\" fixes the issue. This is true with all java versions except with usage of the latest JDK16. The exception gets thrown regardless of this system property setting when using JDK16.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs there a fix for this?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
