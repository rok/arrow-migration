Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt appears that `sum` and `avg` have an optional enum argument to specify overflow behavior.  I'm not certain if I just missed this or if it is new.  Either way the current function mapping does not account for this.",
