Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\n----> 2 data = dataset.drop(\"Churn\") \r\n\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pyarrow/table.pxi in pyarrow.lib.Table.drop()\r\n    KeyError: \"Column 'C' not found\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, for consistency, it would probably be good to have a `Table.drop_column` alias, as all the other methods are named `Table.add_column`, `Table.append_column` and `Table.set_column`",
