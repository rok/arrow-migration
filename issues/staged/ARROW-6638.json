Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nEnabling jemalloc is relevant for developers and packagers, who will want to use this allocator to achieve much better performance. We should very clearly advise average users of Apache Arrow to build core libraries with jemalloc inside but not necessarily force its use out of the box",
