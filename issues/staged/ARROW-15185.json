Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI use to configure ARROW C++ using lowercase flag names `\"on\"` instead of `{}\"ON\"{`}, that works fine with the C++ library and Python library, but leads to build errors on R.\r\n\r\nThat's because the R build process looks for compile flags in `ArrowOptions.cmake` and those compile flags are compared with the uppercase ones.\r\n\r\nSo in my `ArrowOptions.cmake` I had\r\n```java\n\r\n### Build the Parquet libraries\r\nset(ARROW_PARQUET \"on\") \n```\r\nwhile the R build script was looking for\r\n```java\n\r\ngrep 'set(ARROW_PARQUET \"ON\")' $ARROW_OPTS_CMAKE \n```\r\nthis can be addressed by making those greps case insensitive",
