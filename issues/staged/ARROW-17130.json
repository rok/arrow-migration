Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRead_CSV ParseOptions allows only a single character delimiter.   Single character delimiters are highly susceptible to the candidate value existing within the data to be loaded, negating the ability to serve as a delimiter.\r\n\r\nIf a double character delimiter is used, the current limit of a single character returns  \"only single character unicode strings can be converted to Py_UCS4, got length 2\"",
