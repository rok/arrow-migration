Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis only impacts columns that are not zero-copyable. The GIL only needs to be held while invoking C API functions like `PyArray_SimpleNew` or `PyString_FromStringAndSize`. If there are many string columns, we may be concerned over GIL contention",
