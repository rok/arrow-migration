Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSimplify the creation of bit buffers in the comparison kernel by introducing a standard Iterator<Item=bool> -> Buffer function.\r\n\r\nMost null-buffer logic can rely on byte-level boolean operations, so it may not have much utility outside of the comparison kernel?",
