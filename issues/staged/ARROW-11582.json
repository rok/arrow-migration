Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'd like to use the R package interface to access data distributed in a tab-separated text file that is much larger than available RAM.\u00a0 I understand that in principle this is possible using `open_datatset()` in text mode and then streaming data out to parquet via `write_dataset()`, but this strategy fails even on small text files with an unexpected error:\r\n\r\nHere's a minimal reproducible example.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nfs::dir_create(\"import_dir\")\r\nreadr::write_tsv(mtcars, \"import_dir/mtcars.tsv\")\r\nds <- arrow::open_dataset(\"import_dir\", format=\"text\", delim=\"\\t\")\r\narrow::write_dataset(ds, \"parquet_dir\")\r\nThe error I get occurs only on the last line (`write_dataset()`), saying: \r\nError in options$update(...) : attempt to apply non-function\r\n\u00a0",

Not sure if that qualifies for a separate issue?\n  \n- It would be sweet if write_dataset() could merely fall back on a valid format rather than throwing an error message?\u00a0"

I was working with a symlinked dataset last week and it was fine.\n- Regarding compressed CSV datasets, we have ARROW-10372 for that. Agreed it would be nice.\n- We'll also make it so you can open_dataset() on a single file or list of files, not just a whole directory. ARROW-9657 should cover that."
