Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn September 10 the **test-build-vcpkg-win**\u00a0nightly Crossbow job began to fail.\r\n\r\nThis job uses the current\u00a0`windows-2019`\u00a0GHA runner image, so it often catches build errors associated with Visual Studio/MSVC updates.\r\n\r\nThe logs show these error messages (simplified for readability):\r\n```java\n\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,20): warning C4003: not enough arguments for function-like macro invocation 'RtlZeroMemory'\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,20): error C2146: syntax error: missing ')' before identifier 'buffer'\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,20): error C2065: 'buffer': undeclared identifier\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,20): error C2182: 'memset': illegal use of type 'void'\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,20): error C7525: inline variables require at least '/std:c++17'\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,20): error C2059: syntax error: 'constant'\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,20): error C2059: syntax error: ')'\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,47): error C2143: syntax error: missing ';' before '{'\r\ncompute/util_internal.h(26,47): error C2447: '{': missing function header (old-style formal list?)\n```\r\nHere is a link to the logs when they first began to fail on September 10: <https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/3564248552#step:4:2985>\r\n The error messages have remained the same since then.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the logs from the previous day (September 9) before they began to fail:\r\n <https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/3552742330>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPossible causes include:\r\n\r\nUpdates to MSVC that were applied to the\u00a0 `windows-2019`\u00a0GHA runner image on September 9:\r\n <https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/pull/3452>\r\n\r\nOne of these commits on September 9:\r\n <https://github.com/apache/arrow/search?o=desc&p=1&q=committer-date%3A2021-09-09&s=author-date&type=commits>\r\n\r\nChanges to one of the vcpkg-installed Arrow dependencies on September 9 (but I don't see any such changes in the `microsoft/vcpkg` repo commit history).",
