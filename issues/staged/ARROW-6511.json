Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\ndev/run_docker_compose.sh and Makefile.docker perform fundamentally the same function: run docker-compose conveniently. Consolidating them is probably worthwhile, and since Makefile.docker also builds dependencies it seems the natural choice.\r\n\r\nupdate dev/README.md as well",
