        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15341](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15341). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nipc.Reader produces records whose columns have a reference count of two. As a result, once the reference count of Records produced by the Reader goes to zero, the column arrays will still have a reference count of one and won't be properly accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe loading of the columns in the record is driven from this loop:\r\nhttps://github.com/influxdata/idpe/blob/185d09d8250c456e6b8417fde622f921b8850c06/vendor/github.com/apache/arrow/go/arrow/ipc/file_reader.go#L338\r\n\r\nThe memory for the array buffers is allocated here:\r\nhttps://github.com/influxdata/idpe/blob/185d09d8250c456e6b8417fde622f921b8850c06/vendor/github.com/apache/arrow/go/arrow/ipc/file_reader.go#L361\r\n\r\nctx.loadArray ultimately calls array.MakeFromData which returns an array with a reference count already set to one.\r\n\r\nFinally, array.NewRecord retains each of its columns:\r\nhttps://github.com/influxdata/idpe/blob/cd8adab2c1d512f68376064cb7089067d4df567f/vendor/github.com/apache/arrow/go/arrow/array/record.go#L156\r\n\r\nit seems like the code in ipc.Reader that constructs the column arrays needs to release them once the Record has ownership.",
