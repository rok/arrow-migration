Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNoticed while playing with a Flight client. This snippet inadvertently suppresses all errors that come from the underlying MessageReader since `next` sets `done` after an error is encountered.\r\n```go\n\r\nfunc (r *Reader) Read() (array.Record, error) {\r\n\tif r.rec != nil {\r\n\t\tr.rec.Release()\r\n\t\tr.rec = nil\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif !r.next() {\r\n                // r.done is set if next() errors, so we always\r\n                // return EOF instead of the actual error\r\n\t\tif r.done {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, io.EOF\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn nil, r.err\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn r.rec, nil\r\n}\n```",
