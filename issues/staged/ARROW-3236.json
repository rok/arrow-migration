Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `position_` field is initialized as -1, but the file writer class begins writing and aligning the format without updating the position, so this results in an extra byte written. This was reported in https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2559. A bit disturbing that this was not caught in unit tests",

We never read this first message in the C++ reader library. Patch incoming to make code more robust"
