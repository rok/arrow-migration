        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8782](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8782). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI plan on adding a new benchmarks folder beneatch the datafusion crate, containing benchmarks based on the NYC Taxi data set. The benchmark will be a CLI and will support running a number of different queries against CSV and Parquet.\r\n\r\nThe README will contain instructions for downloading the data set.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark will produce CSV files containing results.\r\n\r\nThese benchmarks will allow us to manually verify performance before major releases and on an ongoing basis as we make changes to Arrow/Parquet/DataFusion.\r\n\r\nI will be basing this on existing benchmarks I recently built in Ballista [1] (I am the only contributor to these benchmarks so far).\r\n\r\nA dockerfile will be provided, making it easy to restrict CPU and RAM when running these benchmarks.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista/tree/master/rust/benchmarks\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

There are a couple of things specifically that I wanted your opinion on.\r\n1. Could you confirm that it is OK to reference public data sets like this from the repo (we wouldn't be including any data files, just instructions on how to download them)\n1. Do you think there is any value in the future on having common data sets like this that we can use across implementations to get an idea of comparative performance and to have examples that are similar between implementations?"

Yes, also sounds fine (and a good idea, for comparison purposes). We could collect some example data download and preparation scripts (e.g. downloading NYC taxi datasets and converting them to Parquet in a common location)\r\n\r\ncc `[~npr]`"
