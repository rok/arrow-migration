        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9749](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9749). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently format specific scan options are embedded as members of the corresponding subclass of FileFormat. Extracting these to an options struct would provide better separation of concerns; currently the only way to scan a parquet formatted dataset with different options is to reconstruct it in a differently optioned format from its component files.\r\n\r\nCsvFileFormat could retain ParseOptions as a member, since (for example) tab-separated vs comma-separated values can justifiably be considered different formats.",
