This is also known by the (new) project maintainers. Due to complications they continued the project under a new name: `packed_simd_2`.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\npacked_simd = { version = \"0.3.4\", package = \"packed_simd_2\" }\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/packed_simd",

I'm aware of the packed_simd_2 change, and was planning on addressing it.\r\n\r\nWhile we use an old nightly (call it a six-monthly at this stage), this issue will definitely break a lot of code for users."
