        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-809](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-809). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe bug can be triggered through python:\n```Java\nimport pyarrow.parquet\narray = pyarrow.array.from_pylist([1] * 1000000)\n\nrb = pyarrow.RecordBatch.from_arrays([array], ['a'])\nrb2 = rb.slice(0,2)\n\nwith open('/tmp/t.arrow', 'wb') as f:\n  w = pyarrow.ipc.FileWriter(f, rb.schema)\n  w.write_batch(rb2)\n  w.close()\n```\n\nwhich will result in a big file:\n```Java\n$ ll /tmp/t.arrow \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 itai itai 800618 Apr 12 13:22 /tmp/t.arrow\n```\n",

This could be either by a simple boolean, the original dimensions or a reference to the original array.\n"

There may be other instances as well that i'm not aware of.\n\nSeems to me that adding a private boolean `IsSliced` to the array is the cleanest way.\n"
