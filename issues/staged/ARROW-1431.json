Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOne example is for ListVector, the JsonFileReader sets the validity, offset and data, but doesn't set `lastSet` variable in the ListVector instance.\n\nArrowFileReader works correct before it invokes `loadFieldBuffers` and intialize `lastSet` correctly:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/complex/ListVector.java#L120\n\nThis doesn't break integration tests but can cause weird bugs when people call methods on the vector read from json.",
