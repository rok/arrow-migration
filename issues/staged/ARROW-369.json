        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-369](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-369). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of only being able to only convert single single record batches and tables that consist only of single ColumnChunks, we should also support the construction of Pandas DataFrames from multiple RecordBatches. In the most simple way, we would convert each batch to a Pandas DataFrame and then concat them all together. A second (and preferred) implementation would extend the C++ function `ConvertColumnToPandas` in `python/src/pyarrow/adapters/pandas.*` to work on chunked columns.",
