        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16337](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16337). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a `store_schema` flag that determines whether we store the Arrow schema in the Parquet metadata (under the `ARROW:schema` key) or not. This is exposed in the C++, but not in the Python interface. It would be good to also expose this in the Python layer, to more easily experiment with this (eg to check the impact of having the schema available or not when reading a file)",
