Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI wasn't sure if this was deliberate but it appeared while writing unit tests and so wanted to check what was the intention before changing it. Arrays compare equal when null slots are respectively null so this seems inconsistent.",
