Get them back in sync and consider automating some method of checking that they are in sync, e.g. by failing the `homebrew-cpp` and\u00a0\r\n `homebrew-r-autobrew`\u00a0nightly tests if our copies don't match what's in the Homebrew and autobrew repos (but only if there were changes there that weren't made in our repo, and not the inverse).\r\n\r\nUpdate the instructions at\u00a0\r\n <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW/Release+Management+Guide#ReleaseManagementGuide-UpdatingHomebrewpackages>\u00a0as needed.",

The current repo is mostly intended to build libarrow for macos 10.11 and 10.13. For newer versions of macos we use this tap to build arrow: https://github.com/autobrew/homebrew-cran\r\n\r\nAlso, the CRAN package now uses a much simpler script to fetch a suitable binary of libarrow (https://github.com/autobrew/scripts/blob/master/apache-arrow), it no longer has to bootstrap a homebrew installation like we did early on."

Also keep in mind that CRAN checks use 10.13.\r\n\r\nYes, we definitely still need to test this, I thought (though I \\***have not**\\* dug into this) the new autobrew scripts did the right thing for each version (Jeroen has a few different repos and his comment made it seem like our setup was always trying to pull out of backports, when it should only do that on old macOSes, but pull out of one of the newer ones on newer macOSes)"

So these changes should clearly be synced in both directions.\r\n\r\nThere are some other changes that should obviously be excluded (download url/version + sha) but also some where I am unsure if we should also sync them down:\r\n- a patch step to change the mimalloc version in versions.txt\n- an addition to the test step (running the cpp tests?)"

It is ok that the autobrew and the homebrew formulae are different (since in the newest versions of the autobrew setup, if we are on a modern enough system we _just use brew_).\r\n\r\nIf I'm remembering correctly, https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12157/files#diff-4b112dbca2ece7c78e15eb8aff3218e21dd6f4b1fab7cfc9182830488f68ca58R22-R30 was basically the operative code that fixes this. If I were you, I would take the commits on my branch there and create a new branch and push forward with that since it will let you run it in CI. Though the R tests will probably segfault with the simd issue in ARROW-15678. Maybe that's fine (since it's \"only\" a limited number of computers that this happens on \u2014 just so happens the GH runners are one of those, apparently) or maybe we'll need to actually resolve ARROW-15678?
