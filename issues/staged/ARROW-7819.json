Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe tool should take a protobuf expression from stdin and dump the IR to stdout. This might require some though as the schema is not always known. It could mean a refactor to support plain array, especially for the Filter kernel.",
