Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am planning on tackling this soon. The basic plan is to change the table scan() method to return multiple scanners (one per partition) so that the query execution can process each partition on a separate thread.\r\n\r\nThis will involve changing some of the DataFusion APIs to use Arc instead of Rc.",
