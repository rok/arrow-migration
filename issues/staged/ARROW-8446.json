        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8446](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8446). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/6047#discussion_r402391318\r\n\r\nWhen specifying a directory to `ParquetDataset`, we will detect if a `_metadata` file is present in the directory and use that to populate the `metadata` attribute (and not include this file in the list of \"pieces\", since it does not include any data).\r\n \r\nHowever, when passing a list of files to `ParquetDataset`, with one being \"_metadata\", the metadata attribute is not populated, and the \"_metadata\" path is included as one of the ParquetDatasetPiece objects instead (which leads to an ArrowIOError during the read of that piece).\r\n\r\nWe _could_ detect it in a list of paths as well.\r\n\r\nNote, I mentioned `ParquetDataset`, but if working on this, we should probably directly do it in the datasets API-based version.  \r\nAlso, I labeled this as Python and not C++ for now, as this might be something that can be handled on the Python side (once the C++ side knows how to process this kind of metadata -> ARROW-8062)",
