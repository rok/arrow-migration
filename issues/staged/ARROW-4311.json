        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4311](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4311). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the latest changes to filesystem.py some new functions have been added to check the source string when calling pq.ParquetWriter. With the current implementation some assumptions are done about the format of the string which means that if the string is provided following some of these patterns it will be automatically split/formatted and changed to something else.\r\n\r\nTo give you a specific example, if I provide a string like\u00a0`directory/level1#level2.parquet`\u00a0it will be written to disk as\u00a0`directory/level1`. The behaviour has changed on 0.12.0 from 0.11.1 and nothing is stated in the documentation.",
