        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17270](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17270). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13755#pullrequestreview-1056673168\r\n\r\n> BTW, can we move the \"Installing Nightly Packages\" section to development documents (in a follow-up task)? It seems that this doesn't follow the ASF policy (It seems that \"Use them at your own risk\" isn't suitable for the ASF policy):\n> \n> https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#publication\n> \n> Projects SHALL publish official releases and SHALL NOT publish unreleased materials outside the development community.\n> \n> During the process of developing software and preparing a release, various packages are made available to the development community for testing purposes. Projects MUST direct outsiders towards official releases rather than raw source repositories, nightly builds, snapshots, release candidates, or any other similar packages. Projects SHOULD make available developer resources to support individuals actively participating in development or following the dev list and thus aware of the conditions placed on unreleased materials.",
