Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen the Int64Builder is used in a context without BigNum, appending two numbers combines them into a single Int64:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n> v = Arrow.Builder.new({type: new Arrow.Int64()}).append(1).append(2).finish().toVector()\r\n> v.get(0)\r\nInt32Array [ 1, 2 ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas the same process with BigNum creates two new Int64s.",
