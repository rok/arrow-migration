Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Java implementation doesn't seem to have any documentation or examples on how to get started with basic operations such as creating an array. Javadocs exist but how do new users even know which class to look for?\r\n\r\nI would like to create an examples module and one simple example as a starting point. I hope to have a PR soon.",
