        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10455](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10455). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the CI for windows is not correctly caching. Specifically, the key used to cache is always the same, irrespectively of the files that were changed. Consequently, the build is not leveraging cache.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExample: https://github.com/apache/arrow/runs/1336703057\r\n```java\n\r\nRun actions/cache@v1\r\nwith:\r\n    path: rust/target\r\n    key: windows-rust-\r\n    restore-keys: windows-rust-\r\n```\r\nnote how the `key` does not contain the files hash.",
