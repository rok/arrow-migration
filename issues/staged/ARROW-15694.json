        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15694](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15694). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs part of the transition away from using the name `master` for the default Git branch, we need to update the GitHub Actions website deployment workflow trigger.\r\n\r\nSince there does not appear to be any way to dynamically compute the default Git branch name in a GitHub Actions push trigger condition, a temporary workaround would be to add support for pushing to either `master` or `{}main{`}.\r\n\r\nOnce Apache Infra switches the default Git branch for `apache/arrow-site` to `{}main{`}, we can completely remove support for triggering the GitHub Actions website deployment workflow on pushes to `master` from `{}.github/workflows/deploy.yml{`}. This follow up work is tracked by ARROW-15988.\r\n\r\nThe main file that will need updating is `{}.github/workflows/deploy.yml{`}.",
