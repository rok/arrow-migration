Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe purpose of this JIRA is to decouple the physical structure of the stream from the StreamReader API. So if we wanted to put the stream components into different physical files on disk, this would permit the construction of a different kind of StreamIterator that knows how to read the respective stream components from files",

We may want to have other implementations of `StreamReader` to provide a uniform C++ interface to streaming Arrow data. The current StreamReader presumes a particular byte stream representation"
