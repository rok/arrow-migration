Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom `[~kszucs]`: We need to define a more pythonic API for the dataset bindings, because the current one is pretty low-level.\r\n\r\nOne option is to provide a \"open_dataset\" function similar as what is available in R.\r\n\r\nA short-cut to go from a Dataset to a Table might also be useful.",
