Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://www.mail-archive.com/user@arrow.apache.org/msg00680.html, and my answer to it (experimentation in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/jorisvandenbossche/9382de2eb96db5db2ef801f63a359082). \r\nIt seems we support that the partition field is also present in the actual data, but it's probably good to add some explicit tests to ensure the expected behaviour.",
