        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-719](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-719). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nc_glib/ uses GNU Autotools (autoconf, libtool and so on) build system.\nNormally, source archive that uses GNU Autotools build system includes configure script. Because users don't need GNU Autotools if source archive includes configure script.\n\nconfigure script is generated by running autogen.sh (autoreconf) with configure.ac and Makefile.ams.\n\nThe current Apache Arrow release script (dev/02-source.sh) just runs \"git archive\". The generated archive doesn't include configure script. So users need GNU Autotools.\n\nI hope that c_glib/ source archive includes configure script. Normally, source archive is generated by \"make dist\" for package that uses GNU Autotools. The generated source archive includes configure script and all needed files.\n\nHow should I change the current release script? Should I change dev/02-source.sh, create a new file or choose other approach? \n",
