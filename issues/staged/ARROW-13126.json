Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe LZ4 compressed feather format works really well and is quite nice and fast than Parquet when reading all the columns out. For single columns, looks like feather format does not yet support the capability to read out only the required columns from the disk. Are there any plans to add support for this? Here are some numbers to support my claim from an experiment with a table with 17 columns and 5 million rows in uncompressed parquet and LZ4 compressed feather format. No memory mapping involved.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\npq_all_cols: 0.4179724836349487 ms\r\nfeather_all_cols: 0.26202451705932617 ms\r\npq_single_col: 0.10951032638549804 ms\r\nfeather_single_col: 0.2119576358795166 ms",

That makes sense now. That is probably the reason for the slightly lesser time taken to read a single column as compared to all the columns in a feather file.\u00a0\r\n> ARROW-12683\u00a0describes the needed optimization, essentially.\r\n\r\nGood to see that this issue is already getting attention."
