        "title": "[Python] Should the new field_ argument on Table.set_column() be optional? (Unnecessary breaking change)",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6805](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6805). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe new **field_** argument (Table.set_column() on version 0.15.0) helps to add extra information on the column metadata. But it should not be mandatory, in some cases it is simply redundant like that:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```python\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"foo\": [1, 2, 3]})\r\ntbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df=df, preserve_index=False)\r\n\r\nif pa.__version__ == \"0.15.0\":\r\n    field = pa.field(name=\"foo\", type=\"double\")\r\n    tbl = tbl.set_column(0, field, tbl.column(\"foo\").cast(\"double\"))\r\nelse:\r\n    tbl = tbl.set_column(0, tbl.column(\"foo\").cast(\"double\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that this argument should be optional to avoid redundant code and to keep compatibility with version <0.15.0.
