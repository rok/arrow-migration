Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Structs_vs._Classes. I have suspected that the types in `type.h` should be classes, but this suggests it pretty strongly. It would be better to address this sooner rather than later. \n\nWe should also make the member access functions instead of bare attributes, e.g. `type->id()` instead of `type->type`",
