        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11441](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11441). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`readr::read_csv()` lets you read in data from a character vector, useful for (e.g.) taking the results of a system call and reading it in as a data.frame. \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n> readr::read_csv(c(\"a,b\", \"1,2\", \"3,4\"))\r\n# A tibble: 2 x 2\r\n      a     b\r\n  <dbl> <dbl>\r\n1     1     2\r\n2     3     4\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne solution would be similar to ARROW-9235, perhaps, treating it as a textConnection. \r\n\r\nAnother solution is to write to a tempfile.",

There's surely a more efficient way to do that, but this would work."
