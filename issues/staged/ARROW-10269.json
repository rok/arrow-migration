Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should update to a more recent nighly after the 2.0.0 release. It carries some clippy annoyances, which will mean that I have to revert much of what I did around float comparisons.\r\n\r\nMight also be preferable to do this sooner, so that we can complete the clippy integration and throw away the carrot in favour of the stick.",
