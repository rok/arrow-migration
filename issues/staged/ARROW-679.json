Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is based on the discussion in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/404 for ARROW-661. \n\nThe idea is that the C++ implementation will not permit lengths over INT32_MAX by default (you will still need to use an extra option), but we will permit them in the serialized metadata. Arrow implementations shall not be required to support \"large\" fields.",
