Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn order to deprecate the \"legacy\" pa.hdfs.HadoopFileSystem and pa.hdfs.connect(), we should ensure that the documentation for the new filesystem interface is fully up to date:\r\n\r\n- The docstring of pyarrow.fs.HadoopFileSystem misses some keywords (that are included in the docstring of pa.hdfs.HaddopFileSystem)\n- The user guide about the legacy one (https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/filesystems_deprecated.html) contains more content, which should be added to the new user guide page as well (if still correct for the new filesystem)\n  \n",

Looking at the docstring, I think the content for `user` and `extra_conf` params can still be copied from pa.hdfs.connect to the new implementation."
