The test seems to fail on something that already failed in the past as well (`pa.array(np.array(['', '0', '0\\ud800', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7'], dtype='<U2'))` fails with released version of pyarrow as well), and is a hypothesis test, so it might be a rare error due to the random parametrization of hypothesis. \r\n\r\nhttps://crossbow.voltrondata.com/ says the test is failing for 4 days, although there is only 1 failure link.\r\n\r\n(that said, the project doesn't seem actively maintained anymore, so we should maybe consider removing or disabling it in our nightly integration builds)"

Failures that started two days ago appear as not having a successful build on the last 4 days (even though it's only two days). The failed action:\r\n\r\n![image-2022-09-12-16-55-12-149.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13049181/image-2022-09-12-16-55-12-149.png)\r\n\r\nI am not sure why it only appears one link on the crossbow report page though, there should be two. I'll investigate if we can retry generating reports if there is a missing one to have more accurate data on those cases.\r\n\r\nAs per this specific failure Kartothek does not seem to have activity during the last year: <https://github.com/JDASoftwareGroup/kartothek/>\r\n\r\nI agree with removing the nightly tests, should I send an email to the mailing list in case someone wants to keep it before proceeding?"
