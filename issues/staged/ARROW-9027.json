Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current `test_parquet.py` file is already above 4000 lines of code, and it is becoming a bit unwieldy to work with. \r\nBetter structuring it, and maybe splitting it in multiple files, would help (separate test files could cover tests for basic reading/writing, tests for metadata/statistics objects, tests for multi-file datasets)\r\n\r\n",
