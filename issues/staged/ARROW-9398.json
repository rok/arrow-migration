Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPer the review comments of\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7607>\r\n\r\n\"Instead, we should add all the kernel variants to the same\u00a0`Function`\u00a0instance and then the\u00a0`Dispatch*`\u00a0methods should select the kernel with the maximum SIMD level as set on the Kernel object. That was the idea of the\u00a0`simd_level`\u00a0parameter\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe should delegate the SIMD sum kernels to function instance",
