Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI've seen that Pandas sparse series was not supported in pyarrow since it was planned to be deprecated.\u00a0 In Pandas 1.0.1 they released a stable version of sparse array and as far as I know it is not planned to be deprecated anymore. Are you planning to support sparse series in next versions of pyarrow ?",

Or in which part of pyarrow to you want to see it supported?\r\n\r\nEg when converting a pandas DataFrame with sparse columns to a pyarrow Table, we could densify the sparse array (since Arrow has no support for sparse arrays in its columnar format), but I am not sure this is what users would expect.\r\n\r\nSupport for conversion to one of the sparse tensors in pyarrow could indeed be added.

We can't use scipy sparse matrices since they support compression on zeros only and not nans and we want the data to be sparse in the whole flow - dataframe->pyarrow->plasma store. \r\n\r\nSupport for conversion to one of the sparse tensors in pyarrow could indeed be added - can you please point me to the part where this conversion is happening?\u00a0"
