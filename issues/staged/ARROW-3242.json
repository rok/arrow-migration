        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3242](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3242). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe way that we dispatch to SSE4 hash functions is a remnant from the Impala codebase, which checks CpuInfo on every iteration in debug builds:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/util/hash-util.h#L43\r\n\r\nHowever, the static `model_name_` member is causing some non-determinism related to static member lifetime as reported in ARROW-3241. \r\n\r\nI'm proposing to refactor CpuInfo into a singleton pattern and handle SIMD vs non-SIMD dispatch at a higher level rather than at the lowest level like it is now. This should hopefully make the issue in ARROW-3241 go away",
