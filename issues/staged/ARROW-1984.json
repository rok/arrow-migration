Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nNullableDateMilliVector.getObject() today returns a LocalDateTime. However, this vector is used to store date information, and thus, getObject() should return a LocalDate. \r\n\r\nPlease note: there already exists a vector that returns LocalDateTime \u2013\r\n the NullableTimestampMilliVector.\r\n",
