        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15048](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15048). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/autobrew/homebrew-core/issues/89#issuecomment-990141387\r\n\r\nHowever the underlying problem here may be that we need to update the script (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/HEAD/r/tools/autobrew) in apache arrow that uses this repo to build a version of apache-arrow. The current repo is mostly intended to build libarrow for macos 10.11 and 10.13. For newer versions of macos we use this tap to build arrow: https://github.com/autobrew/homebrew-cran\r\n\r\nAlso, the CRAN package now uses a much simpler script to fetch a suitable binary of libarrow (https://github.com/autobrew/scripts/blob/master/apache-arrow), it no longer has to bootstrap a homebrew installation like we did early on.",
