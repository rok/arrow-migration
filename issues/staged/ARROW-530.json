Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we can only track the amount of bytes allocated by the main memory pool or the alternative jemalloc implementation. To better understand certain situation, we should provide a MemoryPool proxy implementation that tracks only the amount of memory that was made through its direct calls but delegates the actual allocation to an underlying pool.",
