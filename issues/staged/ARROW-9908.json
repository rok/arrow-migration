        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9908](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9908). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the JSON reader does not support any temporal data types. Columns with **numerical**\u00a0data should be interpretable as temporal type when defined accordingly in the schema. Currently this would throw an error with a misleading message (\"struct types are not yet supported\").\r\n\r\nrelated issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4803 focuses on parsing temporal data based on strings inputs.\u00a0",
