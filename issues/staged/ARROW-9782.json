        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9782](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9782). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith the new dataset writing bindings, one can do `ds.write_dataset(data, format=\"feather\")` (Python) or `write_dataset(data, format = \"feather\")` (R) to write a dataset to feather files. \r\n\r\nHowever, because \"feather\" is just an alias for the IpcFileFormat, it will currently write all files with the `.ipc` extension.   \r\nI think this can be a bit confusing, since many people will be more familiar with \"feather\" and expect such an extension. \r\n\r\n(more generally, \".ipc\" is maybe not the best default, since it's not very descriptive extension. Something like \".arrow\" might be better?)\r\n\r\ncc `[~npr]` `[~bkietz]`\r\n",
