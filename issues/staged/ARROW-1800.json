Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`UniformDecimalDistribution` currently generates values outside the range specified for the given precision in cases where the number of bytes required to represent a decimal value was less than or equal to 8.\r\n\r\nFor example, for a 1 byte value the range is -128, 127 for the low bits and -1, 0 for the high bits. In cases where the low bits generated a negative number and the high bits generated a zero value the number can end up being much larger than desired.\r\n\r\nIt's much easier to just generate `N` random bytes and sign extend based on the sign bit of the last byte.",
