        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13168](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13168). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n Note: currently timezone database is not available on windows so timezone aware operations will fail.\r\n\r\nWe're using tz.h library which needs an updated timezone database to correctly handle timezoned timestamps. See [installation instructions](https://howardhinnant.github.io/date/tz.html#Installation).\r\n\r\nWe have the following options for getting a timezone database:\r\n1. local (non-windows) OS timezone database - no work required.\n1. arrow bundled folder - we could bundle the database at build time for windows. Database would slowly go stale.\n1. download it from IANA Time Zone Database at runtime - tz.h gets the database at runtime, but curl (and 7-zip on windows) are required.\n1. local user-provided folder - user could provide a location at buildtime. Nice to have.\n1. allow runtime configuration - at runtime say: \"the tzdata can be found at this location\"\n   \n   For more context see: [ARROW-12980](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10457) and [PEP 615](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/#sources-for-time-zone-data).",

In R we have the [tzdb package](https://github.com/r-lib/tzdb). Currently it only provides the text format of the IANA database but we could use that approach if we need something different (maintained sepaerately to keep it up to date). I'm less familiar with Python but I imagine something similar exist there, too.\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\nlist.files(tzdb::tzdb_path(\"text\"))\r\n#>  [1] \"africa\"            \"antarctica\"        \"asia\"             \r\n#>  [4] \"australasia\"       \"backward\"          \"backzone\"         \r\n#>  [7] \"calendars\"         \"checklinks.awk\"    \"checktab.awk\"     \r\n#> [10] \"CONTRIBUTING\"      \"etcetera\"          \"europe\"           \r\n#> [13] \"factory\"           \"iso3166.tab\"       \"leap-seconds.list\"\r\n#> [16] \"leapseconds\"       \"leapseconds.awk\"   \"LICENSE\"          \r\n#> [19] \"Makefile\"          \"NEWS\"              \"northamerica\"     \r\n#> [22] \"README\"            \"southamerica\"      \"theory.html\"      \r\n#> [25] \"version\"           \"windowsZones.xml\"  \"ziguard.awk\"      \r\n#> [28] \"zishrink.awk\"      \"zone.tab\"          \"zone1970.tab\"     \r\n#> [31] \"zoneinfo2tdf.pl\"\r\n```\r\n"

From our end on the R bindings, though, it means we can support Windows through the tzdb R package (if C+ lets us point at a directory with a database in the right format)."

Personally I think that a reasonable solution would be to pass to C++ the \"path\" to the directory containing the database. So that both R and Py and pass their own dir and C++ can embedd files and provide them at install time. What do you think?"

My thought was we might be able to achieve setting this at runtime using `set_install` and `reload_tzdb()` ([See these lines](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/dea502da05363666464e5d441cc7b5428fd964c8/cpp/src/arrow/vendored/datetime/tz.h#L1307-L1308)). Not 100% sure this will work; there seems to be [some issue that this supports the text format and not some binary format](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/issues/626) (I have some more investigating to do)."
