        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14650](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14650). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed in ARROW-10901, 64 bit integer vectors have values64 getters available for systems with support for BigInt typed arrays. Column-oriented dataframe libraries (such as UW's [arquero](https://github.com/uwdata/arquero)) generally use the Chunked::toArray convenience method in favour of directly dealing with chunks or vectors, and therefore always receive the int32/uint32 data.\r\n\r\nI think there are a few alternatives for improving high level access to a 64 bit column's values:\r\n \\* An optional bit width (or is64Bit, like the <T>::from variants) parameter in Chunked::toArray, IntVector::toArray.\r\n \\* A new Chunked::toArray64 method, and the same on IntVector (or at least, the 64 bit variants).\r\n \\* Use values64 directly in the consuming library (loop over the chunks, copy into a destination typed array).\r\n\r\nThe toArray64 option would probably be a bit of a mess (requiring a fallback to toArray on BaseVector), an optional parameter might be the cleanest approach.",
