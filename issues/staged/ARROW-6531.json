Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`BufferedOutputStream::Close` closes the raw file handle unconditionally. This may be undesirable in some circumstances.\r\n\r\nSome alternatives:\r\n\r\n- Do not close it\n- Only close it if the `use_count` of the `shared_ptr` is 1, so we know that no one else has a copy of the shared_ptr",
