        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7906](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7906). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nJust like parquet format, ORC has a large group of fans in Bigdata area, it has better\u00a0performance than parquet in some use cases.\r\n But there is a problem in python is that it doesn't have the standard write function.\r\n\r\nSeems the ORC team itself\u00a0maintains the standard C++ code(<https://github.com/apache/orc/tree/master/c%2B%2B>)\u00a0, so I think it won't take too much effort to integrate into Arrow(C++) and build the hook for python.",
