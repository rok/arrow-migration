Once we're sure that we want to fully remove the wrapping, \r\n\r\n- Remove all references to ARROW_R_WITH_ARROW\n- Remove arrow_available() function and all references to it (arrow must always be available)\n- Update docs to remove mention of the possibility that you could have a package installation that doesn't do anything\n- Remove all references to TEST_R_WITH_ARROW environment variable and remove the r_only() test wrapper",
