Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThought we did this already. For the avoidance of ambiguity we should encourage the use of `pyarrow.ipc.open_file` instead of `pyarrow.open_file`. So the latter will print a deprecation warning. Since many people use these methods we'd need to keep the deprecated versions around for a while",
