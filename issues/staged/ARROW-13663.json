Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur custom `Iterator<T>` has support for STL-like iteration (allowing natural for loops), but `RecordBatchReader` doesn't. Adding STL-like iteration would be a significant quality of life improvement for developers",
