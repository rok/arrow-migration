Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMost of async_generator.h uses std::function to store the operator functions.\u00a0 Primarily this was to simplify the implementation.\u00a0 However, now that it is being used more it ends up being somewhat wordy because lambda cannot be implicitly assigned to std::function.\u00a0 This has gotten to the point where we have created templated overloads that wrap the lambdas in functions.\r\n\r\nIt may be time to take a second look at this decision and converting over to templated callable types.",
