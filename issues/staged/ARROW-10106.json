        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10106](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10106). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOutboundStreamListener has a method isReady() that FlightProducers need to poll during implementations of getStream() to avoid buffering too much data.\r\n\r\nAn enhancement would be to allow setting a callback to run (for example, notifying a CountdownLatch) so that FlightProducer implementations don't need to busy wait.",

I also think having a gRPC-style async API with a StreamObserver-like API would be useful for applications that are concerned with efficiency; FlightStream/FlightProducer is a very convenient API, but the internals do quite a bit of work on behalf of the user to achieve that.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"

The reason is that the unit test implementations of getStream() block until all data has been sent to the client via putNext().\r\n\r\nIn practice, I would think implementers of FlightProducers would make getStream() asynchronous themselves, so it might be better to instead make the unit test FlightProducers have the same behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso, doAction() could have the same problems."
