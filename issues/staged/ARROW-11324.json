        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11324](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11324). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a number (~ hundreds of thousands) of Parquet files that have embedded Arrow schemas in them that have time-valued columns with the type DateTime(TimeUnit::Nanosecond, Some(\"UTC\")).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne of the changes in the Arrow 2 -> 3 working window was to make the Parquet loader prefer the Arrow schema compared to the one generated from the columns.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut because DataFusion has the timezone field of the DateTime variant hardcoded as None, we can't load any of our data after this upgrade; we get errors like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`SELECT * FROM parquet_table WHERE (\"timestamp\" >= to_timestamp('2010-03-24T13:00:00.000000Z') AND \"timestamp\" <= to_timestamp('2010-03-25T00:00:00.000000Z')) ORDER BY timestamp ASC NULLS LAST;`\r\n`Plan(\"\\'Timestamp(Nanosecond, Some(\\\"UTC\\\")) >= Timestamp(Nanosecond, None)\\' can\\'t be evaluated because there isn\\'t a common type to coerce the types to\")`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny ideas/thoughts?\u00a0",
