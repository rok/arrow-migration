Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe FunctionRegistry class provides support for consumers of the library to define their own compute functions and add them to the registry for usage in filter expressions, projections, etc. We don't have any documentation on how to do this, and it'd be worthwhile to add an example too.",
