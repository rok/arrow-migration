        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7972](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7972). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in the Python API you can read a CSV using [`pyarrow.csv.read_csv(\"big.csv\")`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/csv.html). There are some settings for the reader that you can pass in [`pyarrow.csv.ReadOptions`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.csv.ReadOptions.html#pyarrow.csv.ReadOptions), but I don't see an option to read a part of the CSV file instead of the whole (or starting from `skip_rows`). As a result if I have a big CSV file that cannot be fit into memory, I cannot process it with this API.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to implement a chunked iterator in the similar way that [Pandas allows it](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#io-chunking):\r\n```python\n\r\nfrom pyarrow import csv\r\nfor table_chunk in csv.read_csv(\"big.csv\", read_options=csv.ReadOptions(chunksize=1_000_000)):\r\n# do something with the table_chunk, e.g. filter and save to disk\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your reaction.",
