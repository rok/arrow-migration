Trying it with [Podman](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-docker-compose). extends only seems to be used in one location in the [docker-compose file](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). Maybe extends should be removed completely, or used consistently, perhaps by defining base configurations and then adjusting these as needed?\r\n\r\nDocker [extends documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends)."
