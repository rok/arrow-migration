Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe method that add the stubs functions in Gandiva to be exported is huge and it is leading to some errors in the repository\u2019s lint builds in CI, as it showed here: [ARROW-15661: [Gandiva][C++] Add SHA512 function \u00b7 apache/arrow@dbc615a|https://github.com/apache/arrow/runs/5532621946?check_suite_focus=true] \r\n\r\nIt is necessary to break that method in smaller components or disable the lint verification for this specific file.\r\n\r\nThat error blocks the addition of new functions that must be created in stubs files.",
