Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI believe that there is a way to specify a starting template for github issues so that when new issues are opened the template to fill out is already in the issue body.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis could be a useful way to explain the purpose of github issues versus Jira issues with regard to this project with a section marked as \"if you are still unsure if your issue warrants a new Jira issue, delete this section and report your issue\" or similiar.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis might reduce the number of times maintainers have to direct people to open an issue on jira, as the project grows this is going to happen more and more.",
