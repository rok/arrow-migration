If\u00a0`ignore_empty_lines` is false and there are empty lines, it fails to parse (again, with `Invalid: Empty CSV file`).\r\n\r\nCorrect behavior should be to fill those empty lines with missing data for all columns.",

I know CSV is not an extremely well-specified format, but that sounds to me a bit far-fetched. It's also a bit problematic: how do you deal with empty lines at the beginning of a file? You don't know the number of columns yet.\r\n\r\n`[~wesmckinn]`"
