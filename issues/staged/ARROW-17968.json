            "body": "***Note**: [Comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17968?focusedCommentId=17617315) by Casey Carter (caseycarter):*\nThe\u00a0TestSwapEndianArrayData.RandomData is failing due to a combination of poor design and a change we made to the MSVC STL's `<random>` header which shipped in Visual Studio 2022 17.4 Preview 3. This test case generates an array of lengths that are NULL with very low probability (1%) and then asserts that the first and last entries in the array are not NULLs. Assuming a proper PRNG at least one of those asserts will fail for 1.99% of PRNG seeds. Our change to <random>'s `std::uniform_int_distribution` makes that distribution use random bits more efficiently, so the test case observes a different sequence of random numbers from the same seed which now fails. I validated this hypothesis with a quick hack: changing the seed used in the test case from 42 to 1729 results in the test passing.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this test case could be properly fixed, not by picking a different PRNG seed value that happens to succeed, but by forcing the first and last array entries to be non-NULL instead of choosing randomly."
