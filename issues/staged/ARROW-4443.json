How do I disable emails? I've looked all over the Jira UI and can't find anything. Can you double check I'm not involved in a Jira group that always gets emails?\r\n\r\nI'm getting an email for every new ticket created.\r\n\r\n![image-2019-01-31-13-31-59-606.png](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12957173/image-2019-01-31-13-31-59-606.png)",
