Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nShort version: Given a way to convert a vector of rows and a schema to a RecordBatch, we can derive methods for efficiently converting a vector of rows to a Table or even an iterator of rows to a Record Batch Reader. Similarly, we could go the other way: given a way to convert a RecordBatch to a vector of rows, we can derive methods for converting from Tables or RBRs.\r\n\r\nLong version: https://docs.google.com/document/d/174tldmQLMCvOtjxGtFPeoLBefyE1x26_xntwfSzDXFA/edit?usp=sharing",
