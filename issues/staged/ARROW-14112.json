        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14112](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14112). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe index_in / is_in functions should only require the value type be equatable.  Timestamps with a time zone are equatable and therefore we should support these types.\r\n\r\nSince we do support timestamps without a time zone I suspect this was an oversight and not a real limitation.",
