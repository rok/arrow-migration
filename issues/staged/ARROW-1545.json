Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe first line in the [Getting Started](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/) example uses a `Int64Builder` like this:\n```java\nInt64Builder builder(arrow::default_memory_pool(), arrow::int64());\n```\nThe example works, but the `arrow::int64()` argument is not required.",
