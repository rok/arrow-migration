Add /dev/conbench_envs/benchmarks.env  to apache/arrow repo that will have a list env vars to be used to create and activate conda env for build Arrow C++ and running benchmarks\r\n2. If Arrow contributor wants to override a build env var, he/she will need to \r\ncreate apache/arrow PR\r\n- update/add build env var value in /dev/conbench_envs/benchmarks.env\n- add @Ursabot please benchmark comment to PR\n  3. Once benchmarks are done, Arrow contributor will be able to view results via compare/runs links in the PR comment where \n- baseline = PR base HEAD commit with default (master branch version) /dev/conbench_envs/benchmarks.env\n- contender = PR branch HEAD commit with overridden /dev/conbench_envs/benchmarks.env"
