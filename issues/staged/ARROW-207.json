Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n    Currently AllocationManager needs BufferAllocator instance reference for accounting purposes.\n    Having a decorator around the BufferAllocator distrubs the accounting in AllocationManager.\n    Add an unwrap method to allow getting the reference to inner BufferAllocator instance and use\n    this method in AllocationManager to get the actual BufferAllocator.\n\n```java\n      /**\n       * Unwrap the class so that exposes the provided interface, if possible. Otherwise, throw Exception.\n       * @param c\n       *          The class or interface that you want this class to implement/extend.\n       * @return The instance of that class related to 'this'\n       */\n      <T> T unwrap(Class<T> c);\n```",
