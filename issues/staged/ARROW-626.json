This is, of course, one of them, but do we actually want to enumerate each individual change or should there be a broader (or series of broader) issues addressing these kinds of things?"

A number of things in io.pyx may be able to be cleaned up further, but I wanted to get your eyes on it to make sure I'm not going off the rails."
