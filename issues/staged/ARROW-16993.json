When that fails it tries to build Boost as a subproject but by then we've already found a Boost installation and so CMake errors when we try to (re)define the Boost targets.\r\n\r\nARROW-16947 will fix this. I would vote that this is a duplicate/symptom of that unless there's something I missed here."

You have system Boost but it doesn't include system and filesystem components. So `Boost::headers` is loaded but system Boost detection is failed. If system Boost detection is failed, we use bundled Boost and create `Boost::headers` for bundled Boost but `Boost::headers` already exists. It causes this error.\r\n\r\nCMake doesn't provide a feature to remove a created target (`Boost::headers`). We may be able to support this case by reusing (overriding) `Boost::headers` defined by system Boost but it may not be a good CMake manner...\r\n\r\nI think that installing Boost's system and filesystem components to your system is the best solution for this case for now."
