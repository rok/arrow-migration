        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15173](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15173). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAfter ARROW-15169 is merged, the Python--R bridge code will properly use external pointers to pass references to C API structures. The changes made on the R side will (probably) only work with the new pyarrow version. If it doesn't, it's not hard to provide backward compatibility:\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\npa <- reticulate::import(\"pyarrow\")\r\nif (package_version(pa$`__version__`) >= \"6.0.0.9000\") {\r\n# the new code\r\n} else {\r\n# the old code\r\n}\r\n#> NULL\r\n```\r\n",
