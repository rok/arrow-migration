Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`OrcStripeReaderJniWrapper::getSchema` previously used `nullptr` for the memory pool parameter to `arrow::ipc::SerializeSchema` to implicitly call `arrow::default_memory_pool()`. As part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10080 a check was placed to fail on `nullptr` being provided. This change removes the check, but also explicitly calls `arrow::default_memory_pool()` which is used elsewhere in the JNI wrapper.",
