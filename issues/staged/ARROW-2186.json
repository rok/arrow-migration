Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed that `-maltivec` is being passed to the compiler on Linux, with an x86_64 processor. That seemed odd to me. It prompted me to look more generally at our compiler flags related to hardware optimizations. We have the ability to pass `-msse3`, but there is a `ARROW_USE_SSE` which is only used as a define in some headers. There is `ARROW_ALTIVEC`, but no option to pass `-march`. Nothing related to AVX/AVX2/AVX512. I think this could do for an overhaul",
