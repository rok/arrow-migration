Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn the C++ side, the Feather V2 Reader wraps the IPC RecordBatchFileReader, which accepts IpcReadOptions which can control the use of threads (and the default memory pool and some other options). \r\n\r\nOn the Python (cython) side, those options are not passed through. As a consequence the `use_threads` keyword only disables multithreading in the conversion from arrow table to pandas DataFrame, and not the actual reading. As a follow-up on ARROW-13317, we can actually make this keyword control both.p",
