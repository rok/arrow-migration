Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the spec states that dense union offsets for each child array must be \"in order / increasing\". There is an ambiguity: should they be strictly increasing, or are equal values supported?\r\n\r\nThe C++ implementation currently considers that equal offsets are acceptable.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
