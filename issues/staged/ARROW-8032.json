        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8032](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8032). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe example project at <https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/examples/parquet/parquet-arrow/cmake_modules> includes a broken version of FindParquet.cmake ( <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/examples/parquet/parquet-arrow/cmake_modules/FindParquet.cmake> )\r\n\r\nThe other module is, correctly, a link to FindArrow.cmake in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/cmake_modules>\r\n\r\nFor the curious, the broken part is assuming that FindPkgConfig variables will be set if the module is found - this can be false if the include directory is /usr/include. This can be controlled by one of FindPkgConfig's config variables, but the default behaviour changes as of CMake 3.10. It then erroneously reports that Parquet has not been found.\r\n\r\nThis is not a major bug, but I based my build files off of those in the example directory and it took me a LONG time to figure out the error. It can be really confusing for new users and is simple to fix.",
