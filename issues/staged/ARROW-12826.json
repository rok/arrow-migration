        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12826](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12826). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith ARROW-12569 we added a (manual) reverse dependency check job. This runs fine (if slow) for a one-off run. It should be possible to cache between runs. There are a few issues with this currently:\r\n\r\n- {revdepcheck} does not (yet) [support only running new runs](https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck/issues/94)\n- The cache doesn't cache some of the longest running tasks (installing the reverse dependencies)\n- If we cache the revdeps directory, we will need to re-add packages that should be re-checked.\n  \n  We should investigate contributing to revdepcheck to resolve the run-only-new and possibly also add features for cacheing the installations (and only change when the crancache is invalidated / finds a new package?) https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/revdepcheck.extras might also be helpful\n  \n  For posterity, the following is ~what we would need to add to dev/tasks/r/github.linux.revdepcheck.yml\n  ```\n        - name: Cache crancache and revdeps directory\n          uses: actions/cache@v2\n          with:\n            key: ` \"r-revdep-cache-${{ some-way-to-get-arrow-version `\" }}\n            path: |\n              arrow/r/revdep\n              arrow/.crancache\n  ```",
