Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen calling the getTransferPair method of a NullableMapVector, we pass the current vectors callback to the newly created vector. This is wrong, as the new vector needs to have its own callback. Whoever is using the target vector should have a handle on the callBack to deal with schema changes.",
