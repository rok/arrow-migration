This is actually ARROW-8631--the single file reader supports this option but CSV datasets do not. The Arrow CSV reader collects options into three separate objects, and `na` goes into ConvertOptions: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/883eb572bc64430307112895976ba79df10c8c7d/r/R/csv.R#L178. But the Dataset module only knows about ReadOptions, so it tries to interpret all `...` args as ReadOptions https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/883eb572bc64430307112895976ba79df10c8c7d/r/R/dataset-format.R#L125\r\n\r\nARROW-8631 is the ticket to implement this feature; I'll use this ticket to make the error message clearer in R in the meantime."

The example above would yield this error message:\r\n```r\n\r\n Error: The following option is supported in \"read_delim_arrow\" functions but not yet supported here: \"na\" \r\n```\r\nThe added code matches both full and partial option names and improves handling of several other modes of unsupported options.\r\n"
