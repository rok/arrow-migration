Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs being discussed on the mailing list, a possible use case for ExtensionVector involves having the Arrow buffers contain pointer-type values referring to memory outside of the Arrow memory heap. In IPC, such vectors would need to be serialized to a wholly Arrow-resident form, such as a VarBinaryVector. We do not have an API to allow for this, so this JIRA proposes to add new functions that can indicate to the IPC layer that an ExtensionVector requires additional serialization to a native Arrow type (in such case, the extension type metadata would be discarded)",
