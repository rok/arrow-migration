Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith some minor adjustments, the Java IPC stream reader could be more friendly to allow for low level message processing.  By that I mean reading a stream and examining messages without necessarily having to load the Record Batch data.  These include \r\n\r\n- Separate MessageChannelReader.readNextMessage to allow access to the buffer containing the message.\n- MessageChannelReader input channel should be protected\n- ArrowStreamWriter should make the message to end a stream static\n- WriteChannel intToBytes could write to existing bytes or byte buffer instead of creating new array",
