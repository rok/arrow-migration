Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently filesystem union datset is built out using individual in-memory tables. Prior to building out these tables into union dataset a complex filter step has already determined the rows to excluded/included via a mask array. The ask is for this mask/array to be incorporated into writer side of of the union dataset or fragments to eliminate or include rows in final file.\r\n\r\nThis ask if incorporated eliminates an additional step in the application to filter out rows in a table.",
