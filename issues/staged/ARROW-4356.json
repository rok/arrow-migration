Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe regularly break our API so that `turbodbc` needs to make minor changes to support the new Arrow version. We should setup a small integration test to check before a release that `turbodbc` can easily upgrade.",
