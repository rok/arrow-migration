Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6863#discussion_r404913683>\r\n\r\nThere are currently two overloads of `Buffer::FromString`, one which takes an rvalue reference to string and another which takes a const reference and a MemoryPool. In the former case the string is simply moved into a Buffer subclass while in the latter the MemoryPool is used to allocate space into which the string's contents are copied, which necessitates bubbling the potential allocation failure. This seems gratuitous given we don't use `std::string` to store large quantities so it should be fine to provide only\r\n```java\n\r\n  static std::unique_ptr<Buffer> FromString(std::string data); \r\n```\r\nand rely on `std::string`'s copy constructor when the argument is not an rvalue.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a `std::string` which may/does contain large data and must be copied, tracking the copied memory with a MemoryPool does not require a great deal of boilerplate:\r\n```java\n\r\nARROW_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(auto buffer,\r\n                      Buffer(large).CopySlice(0, large.size(), pool));\r\n```",
