Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBallista plans must not include RepartitionExec because it results in incorrect results. Ballista needs to manage its own repartitioning in a distributed-aware way later on. For now we just need to configure the DataFusion context to disable repartition.",
