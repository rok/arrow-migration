Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `read_csv_arrow()` function allows users to pass in options via its parse_options, convert_options, and read_options parameters.  We could allow users to pass these into `open_dataset()` to enable users to more easily switch between `read_csv_arrow()` and `open_dataset()`.  ",
