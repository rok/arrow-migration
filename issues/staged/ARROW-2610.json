Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe DictionaryType is a bit more complex as it also references the dictionary values itself. This also needs to be integrated into `pyarrow.Field.from_jvm` but the work to make DictionaryType working maybe also depends on that `pyarrow.Array.from_jvm` first supports non-primitive arrays.",
