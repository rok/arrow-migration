Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTo help people test new features and detect bugs early, we should make regular releases of the JS package. This could be nightly or whenever we merge a pull request with a JS tag on it. I think the latter would be better since it would reduce the number of releases significantly. \r\n\r\nReleases should be tagged as canary. http://npm.github.io/publishing-pkgs-docs/updating/using-tags.html",
