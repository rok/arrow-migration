Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed that installing the toolchain and building Gandiva on macOS in Travis CI took over 30 minutes in a recent build\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/467681438#L113\r\n\r\nThe overall build took ~45 minutes, so this build isn't far away from timing out. \r\n\r\nIt seems that this could be partly caused by installing some heavy dependencies like llvmdev from conda-forge. conda-forge has been getting a lot slower lately.\r\n\r\nWe should see if using defaults to install llvmdev will improve build times, or if there's a faster way to get the toolchain bootstrapped.
