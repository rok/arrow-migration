Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI don't know how useful general \"multi-character\" delimiter support is, but one specific type of it that seems useful is \"whitespace delimited\", meaning any whitespace (possibly multiple / different whitespace characters). \r\n\r\nIn pandas you can achieve this either by passing `delimiter=\"\\s+\"` or specifying `delim_whitespace=True` (and both are equivalent, pandas special cases `delimiter=\"\\s+\"` as any other multi-character delimiter is interpreted as an actual regex and triggers the slower python engine intead of using the default c engine)\r\n\r\ncc `[~apitrou]` `[~npr]`",

For example files that uses multiple spaces to have some alignment of columns in the plain text is not uncommon I think."
