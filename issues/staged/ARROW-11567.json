See below example.\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nIn [1]: import numpy as np\r\n\r\nIn [2]: import pyarrow.compute as pc\r\n\r\nIn [3]: t = np.arange(321000, dtype='float')\r\n\r\nIn [4]: np.var(t)\r\nOut[4]: 8586749999.916667\r\n\r\nIn [5]: pc.variance(t)\r\nOut[5]: <pyarrow.DoubleScalar: 8586749999.899047>\r\n```",
