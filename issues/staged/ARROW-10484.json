Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe members of `Future<{void,Status}>` differ from other instantiations of `Future<>` since they contain only a Status and not a value. This is reasonable, however it complicates generic usage of `Future<>` since special cases must be added for the different interfaces. IMHO it'd be acceptable to provide an empty \"ValueType\" (or maybe `std::nullptr_t` to follow the precedent of Datum's default state) for those specializations to keep the interface generic.",
