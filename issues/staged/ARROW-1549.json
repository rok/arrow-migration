Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`[~wesmckinn]` mentioned the C++ and Java versions have tests that validate the respective Reader implementations are correct against Arrow files generated by the other implementation. Adding these tests to the JS implementation is important, and should be easy.",

As soon as we have the basic entry point for integration tests so that we can add JS to the test matrix in \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/integration/integration_test.py#L1010\n\nthen incrementally adding and testing more data types should not be too hard. This will also help with driving progress in writing the Arrow format from JS"
