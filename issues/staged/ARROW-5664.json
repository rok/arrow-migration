        "title": "[Crossbow] Execute nightly crossbow tests on CircleCI instead of Travis",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5664](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5664). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe spark integration test has hit the 50mins maximum build time on travis, whereas Circle can run jobs up to 5 hours. All of the nightly tests are run within docker containers so porting travis template to a circleci equivalent template should not be too hard. In order to properly report badges via @ursabot crossbow command, we also need to store which CI service executes a task. So the following changes are required:\r\n\r\n- Port https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/docker-tests/travis.linux.yml to a CircleCI equivalent\n- Store which CI is responsible for running a particular task https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/crossbow.py#L468\n- Update ursabot to generate badges based on the property added in the previous step",
