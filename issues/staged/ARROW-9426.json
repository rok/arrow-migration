But two same \"entry\" key in the same level of YAML maybe showed errror in some IDE, such as \"Goland\".\r\n\r\nI think maybe it's better that merge the two entries to one, such like\u00a0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nentry: bash -c \"pip install cmake-format && python run-cmake-format.py --check; echo\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI run the \"pre-commit run -a\" , but I find many CMake files are re-formatted.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHow do you think about this? `[~wesm]`\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
