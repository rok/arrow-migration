Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently DeleteDirContents fails if the directory is missing.  This can lead to issues with filesystems that don't support empty directories (see ARROW-12358) and it is the behavior desired by the datasets API.  We should be able to ignore missing directories.",
