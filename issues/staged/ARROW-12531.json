Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now, the docs are very much just an API doc but they don't explain how to use most of the library. We should cover\r\n \\* add function/class comments\r\n \\*\\* What does Table.isValid do? Can tables be invalid somehow???\r\n \\*\\* Document `Table.get` and `Table.getChildAt`.\r\n \\*\\* What is the difference between `getColumnAt` and `getChildAt` (for Tables and Columns)?\r\n\\*\\* scan vs forEach?\r\n \\*\\* Why is `BindFunc` optional in `Table.scan`?\r\n \\* remove internal functions from the docs\r\n \\* Document Vectors (<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/modules/_vector_.vector.html> is just a namespace)\r\n \\* Make sure `IntVector` and `FloatVector` appear in docs\r\n \\* What is the difference between `Table` and `DataFrame`?\r\n \\* Add more examples\r\n\r\nAs a good inspiration, we can look at <https://uwdata.github.io/arquero/api/>.",
