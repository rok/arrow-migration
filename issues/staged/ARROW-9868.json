Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`CopyStream` in arrow/filesystem/util_internal.h does this, but we should expose it, multithread it (can read in one thread while the other thread writes), and further see if there are filesystem-specific optimizations (e.g. S3 multipart uploading/downloading). We may also want a version that takes a FileSelector or vector of paths and parallelizes the operations on them.\r\n\r\n",
