Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing a arrow table to s3, I get an NotImplemented Exception.\nThe root cause is in _ensure_filesystem and can be reproduced as follows:\n\nimport pyarrow\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pqa\nimport s3fs\n\ns3 = s3fs.S3FileSystem()\n\npqa._ensure_filesystem(s3).exists(\"anything\")\n\nIt appears that the S3FSWrapper that is instantiated in _ensure_filesystem does not expose the exist method of s3.",
