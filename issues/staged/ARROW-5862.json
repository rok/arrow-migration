        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5862](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5862). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe dictionary builder servers for the following scenario which is frequently encountered in practice when dictionary encoding is involved: the dictionary values are not known a priori, so they are determined dynamically, as new data arrive continually.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when a new value arrives, it is tested to check if it is already in the dictionary. If so, it is simply neglected, otherwise, it is added to the dictionary.\r\n \r\nWhen all values have been evaluated, the dictionary can be considered complete. So encoding can start afterward.\r\n\r\nThe code snippet using a dictionary builder should be like this:\r\n\r\n`DictonaryBuilder<IntVector> dictionaryBuilder = ...`\r\n`dictionaryBuilder.startBuild();`\r\n`...`\r\n`dictionaryBuild.addValue(newValue);`\r\n`...`\r\n`dictionaryBuilder.endBuild();`",
