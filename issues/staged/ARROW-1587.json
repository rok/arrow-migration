Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile we have the custom_metadata field at the Field level, it may be useful to have a proper user-defined type metadata in the `Type` union, which would allow us to provide a physical representation type (e.g. \"Latitude longitude is represented by a struct, whose children consist of two doubles\") from the other non-user defined types.\n\nThis is more flexible than `custom_metadata` because we can leverage existing structure in the Flatbuffers for describing the user type\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Schema.fbs#L285",
