        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15820](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15820). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the table_source node does not appear in our documentation.\r\n\r\nAlso, in `TableSourceNodeOptions` we have:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n  // Size of batches to emit from this node\r\n  // If the table is larger the node will emit multiple batches from the\r\n  // the table to be processed in parallel.\r\n  int64_t batch_size;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when looking into a performance issue today, I realized this description is incomplete.  In reality we should probably call this parameter `max_batch_size`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we should make it clear that a table with smaller batches will emit smaller batches directly (this is a good thing in my case) and will not concatenate small batches together into a larger batch.",

I can work on that PR just after this most probably(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15515). But I am holding that there are some issues that we may need to solve before that (i.e: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15297, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15261, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15263).\u00a0"
