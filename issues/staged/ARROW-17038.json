Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently to_arrow() on a duckdb connection returns a RecordBatchReader. This works fine until you want to query again because RecordBatchReader is one-shot: once you've consumed it, you can't do it again. Among the places where this gets in the way is with the dplyr::glimpse() method (ARROW-16776), which shows a preview of the data. But you can't preview a RBR's data without consuming part of it. \r\n\r\nGoing the other direction, duckdb solves this by holding a reference to the Dataset/query object, and on demand it does Scanner$create() on it, which it can do multiple times.
