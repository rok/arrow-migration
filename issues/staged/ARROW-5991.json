Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI note that `DictionaryBuilder<T>` is book-keeping properties both in `values_builder_` as well as itself, such as `length_` and `null_count_`. \r\n\r\nThere are two possibilities:\r\n\r\n- DictionaryBuilder need not be a subclass of ArrayBuilder\n- A common abstract base for builders could be defined to allow properties like `length_` to be forwarded by virtual overrides",
