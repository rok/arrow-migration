Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\npa.Table.from_arrays doesn't validate that the length of `arrays` and `names` matches. I think this should raise with a `ValueError`:\n\n```Java\nIn [1]: import pyarrow as pa\n\nIn [2]: pa.Table.from_arrays([pa.array([1, 2]), pa.array([3, 4])], names=['a', 'b', 'c'])\nOut[2]:\npyarrow.Table\na: int64\nb: int64\n\nIn [3]: pa.__version__\nOut[3]: '0.7.0'\n```\n\n(This is my first time using JIRA, hopefully I didn't mess up too badly)",
