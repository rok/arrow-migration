        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10118](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10118). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow already has a JSON reader and it would be nice to integrate this with DataFusion so that queries can be run against JSON files.\r\n\r\nThis would probably not be trivial though since we would need to add support for schemaless data sources (it isn't practical to parse the JSON files first to extract the schema).",

For example, if I run \"SELECT a, b,\nc.d.e.f ...\" I would expect to get NULLs for any of these attributes that\ndo not exist on any particular row.\n\nOn Fri, Nov 27, 2020 at 4:00 PM Neville Dipale (Jira) <jira@apache.org>\n\n"
