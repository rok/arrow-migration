Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis code worked as expected in R3.4 and arrow package v0.17:\r\n> df <- data.frame(a=bit64::as.integer64(1:10))\n> arrow::write_feather(x=df, sink=\"/home/ofek/tmp/test64\")\n> df_read <- arrow::read_feather(\"/home/ofek/tmp/test64\")\n> class(df_read$a)   # integer64\r\n\r\nBut upgrading to R4+v3.0.0 we see that the output of class(df_read$a) is \"integer\". Stuff breaks as a result.",

We've already made improvements to make it a bit more obvious though they won't be on our release docs until the 4.0.0 release that is coming up shortly.  "
