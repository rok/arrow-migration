I'd favor to move crossbow to a separate module, bootstrap crossbow at the beginning of each build and implement the download+verification step in the python module instead - with tests. Testing through CIs makes me bald.\r\n\r\nUntil that We could continue to build from git, the nightly builds are kinda stable <https://github.com/kszucs/crossbow/branches/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=nightly>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat do You think?"

What are the benefits of doing that? If we decide to do that (if it is deemed a good idea), as long as we keep the development \"inside the community\" (i.e. we would create something like apache/arrow-crossbow) then it is OK with me"
