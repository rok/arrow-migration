Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm trying to implement R bindings for the compute function \"utf8_center\" but in cases where there are an odd number of spaces in total, the extra space is added to the left.\u00a0 However, in R, the extra space is added to the right.\r\n\r\nPlease can we have another string pad option to determine which side the extra space goes, so I can make the functionality match?",
