Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPlasma currently attempts to evict objects whenever the client tries to create an object and there is not enough space. Sometimes, though, it is preferable to allow the client to try something else, such as skipping creation or freeing other objects. This enhancement would allow the client to pass in a flag during object creation specifying whether objects should be evicted or not.",
