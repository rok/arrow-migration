Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI deal with 10G+ csv files (tab separated) every day. However, rows are of 21 or 22 fields uncertainly.\r\n\r\nIf using pyarrow.csv.read_csv(),\u00a0 error occurs.\u00a0 I see ParseOptions(invalid_row_handler=...) in C++ API, but not in python API.\r\n\r\nIs there a due time for this api in python? Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nCurrently, I have to use pandas.read_csv(on_bad_lines=...) , which is extremely slow for 10G+ files... \u00a0 :(",
