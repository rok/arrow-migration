Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is partly an RFC: given that many people are building the C++ library in order to develop or test other parts of Apache Arrow, it might make sense to opt-in to building the unit tests rather than opting out. There are additional system requirements to build the unit tests, such as a newer version of CMake\r\n\r\n`[~kou]` suggested this originally here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/3140#issuecomment-445694144\r\n\r\nIn principle I'm in favor of this",
