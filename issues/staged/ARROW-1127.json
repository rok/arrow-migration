Maybe we need to rebuilt `pyarrow`\u00a0or change the package to link against jemalloc 4.x ( `[~jreback]` can you test if pinning jemalloc to 4.4.0 fixes the issue?)\n\nThe actual problem here is caused by a bug in glibc (see fix here: https://www.sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=67cbf9a2a9e8953aa7ea875938d6646727c71aaa). Thus possibly doesn't appear on OSX as there is a different glibc version."
