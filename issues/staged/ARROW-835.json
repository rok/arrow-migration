Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nxref https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/551 and https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/551#issuecomment-294325969\n\nthis will allow round-tripping of pandas ``Timedelta`` and numpy ``timedelt64[ns]`` types. The will have a similar TimeUnit to TimestampType (s, us, ms, ns). Possible impl include making this pure 64-bit.\n\n",

We need to articulate what the `Interval` type at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Schema.fbs#L177 is and how it is different from a `Timedelta` with unit. There is good precedent for supporting 64-bit timedelta from other projects"
