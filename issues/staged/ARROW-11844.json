        "title": "[Python] Initial table.take(...) call takes much longer",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11844](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11844). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen you call the table.take(...) function, the first time it will take significantly longer. See the code example below.\r\n```python\n\r\nimport time\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\n# Create table\r\nsize = int(1e6)\r\nids = np.random.choice(np.arange(size), size=size, replace=False)\r\nt = pa.Table.from_arrays(\r\n    [ids, np.random.randint(0, 100000, size=(size))],\r\n    names=['id', 'salary']\r\n)\r\n\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n    tf = t.take(list(range(int(1e5))))\r\n    print(\"Iteration {} took {:4f} seconds\".format(i, time.time() - start))\r\n```\r\nThis prints:\r\n**Iteration 0 took 0.031361 seconds**\r\nIteration 1 took 0.011474 seconds\r\nIteration 2 took 0.012330 seconds\r\nIteration 3 took 0.012391 seconds\r\nIteration 4 took 0.017687 seconds\r\n\r\nAlthough this example is not as severe as I experienced in other works, it still seems significant. Any clue what is causing this behavior?",
