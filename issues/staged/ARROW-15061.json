        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15061](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15061). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nUsing OT we should add spans that report the runtime of kernel functions.  We should  ensure that, if OT is disabled, there is no significant overhead.\r\n\r\nIn addition we should add spans that report the runtime of each exec node.  This may be a little trickier than it would first seem because pipeline breakers like join, etc. don't do all of their work inside of InputReceived.  Those could potentially be added later in follow-up PRs if it is getting to be too tricky.  The simple nodes like FilterNode and ProjectNode should be more straightforward.  These spans should be the parent of any kernel functions launched by that node.\r\n\r\nThere should also be a span for an entire exec plan run that will be the parent of all of this.",

It also doesn't add a span for the entire exec plan (that may be more annoying to #ifdef guard properly)."
