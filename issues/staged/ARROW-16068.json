We could refactor them but I'd prefer to wait until we at least land the UCX work to avoid having conflicts.\r\n\r\nRecordBatchStream could probably be refactored, it's not really user-facing (you generally wouldn't want or need to implement it) but it is technically a public and inheritance based API."
