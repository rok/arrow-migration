        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17949](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17949). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I was trying to update AppVeyor build to use Python 3.10 in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17892 CI build gave me an error about the pyuv source install: [https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/44974788#L884](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/44974788#L884.)\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation me and Joris found that [clcache](https://github.com/frerich/clcache) project used in the AppVeyor setup is archived and it's dependency [pyuv](https://pypi.org/project/pyuv/#files) is no longer maintained.\r\n##### Is there any substitute for clcache?\r\n\r\nThere is a [PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12230/files#diff-1380789f5b2c91702997c503a501ba8cbaa3a44747848e7c372b8b6eda1369f0) from `[~willjones127]` that changes the documentation to advise a use of <https://github.com/Nuitka/clcache> . That project is unfortunately also depending on pyuv.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut is there any other alternative to these two projects? cc `[~raulcd]` `[~assignUser]` \u00a0\r\n##### Arrow C++ documentation\r\n\r\nThe use of clcache is still mentioned in our [C++ docs ](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/developers/cpp/windows.html#building-with-ninja-and-clcache)and should be updated/removed.",

SCCACHE will have precedence over CCACHE if both are installed and SCCACHE credentials are available via envvar. I am not sure if there is caching on Appveyor we could use to cache the ccache cache (xD) but I could take a look."
