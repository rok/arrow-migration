Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a followup to\u00a0https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1445\r\n\r\nRight now, objects allocated on GPUs are never evicted. There should be a flag with the maximum amount of memory that plasma can take on the GPU. If this memory is exceeded, objects should be evicted according to the policy (which is pluggable).",
