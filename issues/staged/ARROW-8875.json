        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8875](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8875). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, in `GetObjectRange` of f3fs the `GetObjectRequest` has no `ResponseStreamFactory` assigned. This means that the bytes returned by the S3 API are first sent to a `std::basic_stringbuf`. To my understanding this has two performance impacts:\r\n \\* `std::basic_stringbuf` uses a growing array to buffer the response, so lots of allocations here\r\n \\* on top of that, you have a copy operation from the `std::basic_stringbuf` when data is read into the Arrow buffer.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a bit costly.\r\n\r\nWith `ResponseStreamFactory`, we might manage to get the data directly into the Arrow buffer.\r\n\r\nI can take a try at it, but I would need some advice. Is there an existing utility to stream data into an Arrow buffer (if it exists, it is well hidden!) ? or should I stream the data into a plain array and then transfer ownership to Arrow ?",

It did not come up in my searches... I'm going to blame the UX of the Jira search on this one ;)\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what I was thinking about.\r\n\r\nnit `[~apitrou]` : I'm not sure to understand why you changed the signature of GetObjectRange to return a GetObjectResult at [https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.cc#L391](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/filesystem/s3fs.cc#L383-L392)\u00a0. Simply returning the number of bytes would make the data flow more readable."
