This was discussed here:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4908#discussion_r306586276>\r\n\r\nI first proposed a shim NOTICE file in the R package that contained a link to the official NOTICE. That would keep a single source of truth for the NOTICE and still satisfy the CRAN request. When you requested the full NOTICE be included, I copied it there, and then added to the `r/Makefile`\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/Makefile#L33>, which copies the NOTICE file every time `make build` is run, which happens when checking locally. Given the constraints, this seemed like the best option that would ensure that the\u00a0full NOTICE file is included in the R package without requiring on human discipline to manually copy it in every time, while also providing a mechanism by which it gets synced with the official version.\u00a0"
