Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nparquet::WriterProperties::Builder has many public functions where we can set the parameters while writing the Parquet format, e.g dictionary_pagesize_limit. However, they are not currently exposed in the documentation because they lack comments in code. Users have to manually check the code to use them.",
