Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, custom types are registered in the tests in an ad-hoc way. Instead, they should use the default serialization context introduced in ARROW-1503 to make it possible to reuse the same code in other projects.",
