Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere's significant boilerplate associated with using enumerations in arrow, since we need to expose them to the bindings which involves a mapping to/from strings per binding. That's not ideal and we could do better with a metaprogramming utility which provides enum semantics but supports basic reflection (min/max value, number of values, to/from string).",
