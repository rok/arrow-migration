        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11796](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11796). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-11580 makes it straightforward to use vcpkg for dependencies. This has been well-tested with **release** builds, but there are some loose ends with **debug** builds. vcpkg installs debug libraries for the dependencies, but there are some problems linking them when `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG`. I was able to get a debug build to succeed on Windows with VS 2019 by turning some features off\r\n```java\n\r\n    -DARROW_FLIGHT=OFF ^\r\n    -DARROW_GANDIVA=OFF ^\r\n    -DARROW_WITH_THRIFT=OFF ^\r\n    -DARROW_PARQUET=OFF ^ \n```\r\nbut there were linking errors when I turned any of those on. I think some of these errors can be resolved by setting additional `\\*\\_MSVC\\_\\*`\u00a0prefix/suffix variables or by working around limitations of which dependencies vcpkg can and cannot install as dynamic link libraries.\r\n\r\nI tested this after installing dynamic link libraries with vcpkg and with `-DARROW_DEPENDENCY_USE_SHARED=ON`. We should also test debug builds with static dependencies and on Linux and Mac.",
