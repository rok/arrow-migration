So something like this (that would address the SO question, I think) works:\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\ndataset = pq.ParquetDataset(['part0.parquet', 'part1.parquet'])\r\ndataset.read_pandas().to_pandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo we think that is enough support? (if so, this issue can be closed I think) \r\nOr do we want to add this to `pq.read_table` ? (which eg also accepts a directory name, which is then passed through to `ParquetDataset`. We could do a similar pass through for a list of paths)\r\n"
