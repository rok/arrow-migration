Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Java implementation of the C Data Interface does not support non-0-offset arrays. This means that arrays like\u00a0pyarrow.array([0, None, 2, 3, 4]).slice(1, 2) cannot be moved to a Java process. This is not even documented as required by the spec because it was an oversight.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

I can't find any related ticket for it either.\r\n\r\nAm I miss something or is it really not supported in Java?\u00a0"
