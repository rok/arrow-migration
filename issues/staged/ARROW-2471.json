        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2471](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2471). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a builder is created with capacity 0 and then data is pushed to the builder, memory reallocation is not triggered and the push fails with an assertion.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that memory reallocation calculates the new capacity as 2x the current capacity which doesn't work if the current capacity is zero.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
