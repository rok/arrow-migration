        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17115](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17115). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe new swiss join assumes that batches are being broken according to the morsel/batch model and it assumes those batches have, at most, 32Ki rows (signed 16-bit indices are used in various places).\r\n\r\nHowever, we are not currently slicing all of our inputs to batches this small.  This is causing conbench to fail and would likely be a problem with any large inputs.\r\n\r\nWe should fix this by slicing batches in the engine to the appropriate maximum size.",
