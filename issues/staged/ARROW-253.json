There is some research showing CPU efficient operations for particular layouts in bit-packed words (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/publ/BitWeaving.pdf)"

We want to get to a point soon where all of the spec is supported so we have to draw a line somewhere and limit the surface area for implementors to ease adoption. Nothing prevents people to experiment with other representations (as long as they stay internal). Those can be added to the spec later.\n\nsome options: \n - restrict int size in Arrow V1. Add bitpacked int vectors in V2.\n - leave all widths (1 to 64) available in V1. Add converters to efficiently unpack for engines that don't operate on packed vectors. (but someone needs to create those).\n\n"

It looks like you've opened JIRA items to hammer out these issues.  Once we have something that we think is a good final candidate for V1 we should make sure to circle it back with the mailing list."
