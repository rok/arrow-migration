Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom GitHub issue https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/4294\r\n\r\nOur vendored string_view header will forward to `std::string_view` if that is available. This can produce ABI conflicts and build errors when arrow or applications which use it are built against c++17.\r\n\r\nI think it's acceptable to just force usage of nonstd's implementation with `#define nssv_CONFIG_SELECT_STRING_VIEW nssv_STRING_VIEW_NONSTD`",
