        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8310). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMinio emits an `XMinioServerNotInitialized` exception on failure to connect, which is recognized by `ConnectRetryStrategy` and used to trigger a retry instead of an error. This exception has an HTTP error 503.\r\n\r\nHowever this code does not round trip through the AWS SDK, which maintains an explicit [mapping from known exception names to error codes](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/blob/d36c2b16c9c3caf81524ebfff1e70782b8e1a006/aws-cpp-sdk-core/source/client/CoreErrors.cpp#L37) and will demote an unrecognized exception name [to `CoreErrors::UNKNOWN`](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/blob/master/aws-cpp-sdk-core/source/client/AWSErrorMarshaller.cpp#L150)\r\n\r\nThe end result is flakiness in the test (and therefore CI) since `ConnectRetryStrategy` never gets a chance to operate, see for example https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6789/checks?check_run_id=552871444#step:6:1778\r\n\r\nProbably `IsConnectError` will need to examine the error string in the event of `CoreErrors::UNKNOWN`.",
