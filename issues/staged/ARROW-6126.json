Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf dictionaries are expected in a stream, but the stream terminates, then \"empty stream\" logic is triggered to suppress errors, see\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/ipc/reader.cc#L482\r\n\r\nIt's probably esoteric but this \"empty stream\" logic will trigger if the stream terminates in the middle of the dictionary messages, which is a legitimate error. So we should only bail out early (concluding that we have an empty stream) if the first dictionary message is null",
