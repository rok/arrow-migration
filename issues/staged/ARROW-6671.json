Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently there's `SparseCOOIndex` and `SparseCSRIndex`, but also `SparseTensorCOO` and `SparseTensorCSR`.\r\n\r\nFor consistency, it would be nice to rename the latter `SparseCOOTensor` and `SparseCSRTensor`.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's not obvious the `SparseMatrixCSR` alias is useful.",

I think that is potentially more confusing than it being limited to 2D.\r\n\r\n+1 for the consistent naming"
