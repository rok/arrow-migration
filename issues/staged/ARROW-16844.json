        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16844](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16844). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDataFusion has the ability to convert between Substrait expressions and it's own internal expressions. (See: <https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-substrait> .) It would be cool if we had a similar conversion for Acero's Expression class.\r\n\r\nThis might unlock allowing datafusion-python to easily use PyArrow datasets, by using Substrait as intermediate format to pass down filter and projections from Datafusion into the scanner. (See early draft here: <https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-python/pull/21>.)\r\n\r\nOne problem is that it's unclear what should be the type of the object in Python representing the Substrait expression. IIUC Python doesn't have direct bindings to the Substrait protobuf.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
