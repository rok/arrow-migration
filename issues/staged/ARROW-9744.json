        "title": "[Python] Failed to install on aarch64",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9744](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9744). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMy team is attempting to migrate some workloads from x86-64 to ARM64, a blocker for this is PyArrow failing to install. `pip install pyarrow` fails to build the wheel as -march isn't correctly resolved:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n -- System processor: aarch64\r\n -- Performing Test CXX_SUPPORTS_ARMV8_ARCH\r\n -- Performing Test CXX_SUPPORTS_ARMV8_ARCH - Failed\r\n -- Arrow build warning level: PRODUCTION\r\n CMake Error at cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake:338 (message):\r\n Unsupported arch flag: -march=.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's possible to get the build to work after editing `cmake_modules/SetupCxxFlags.cmake` to force ARROW_ARMV8_ARCH_FLAG to end up as an architecture such as 'armv8-a' - although some more elaborate logic is really needed to pick up the correct extensions.\r\n\r\nI can see that there\u00a0 have been a number of items discussed in the past both on Jira and in GitHub issues ranging from simple fixes to the cmake script to more elaborate fixes cross-product for arch detection - but I wasn't able to discern how the project wishes to proceed.\r\n\r\nWith AWS pushing their ARM-based instances heavily at this point I would advocate for picking a direction before an influx of new issues.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

The build it while building pyarrow option doesn't work for me with the same error that Eamon received.\r\n\r\n`[~space55]` the instructions on <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/python.html#building-on-linux-and-macos> to build the C++ are straightforward enough. The built .whl can be installed either directly using pip, or if you have a private PyPi then drop it there to avoid copying it manually.\r\n\r\n`[~kou]` - thanks for the quick turnaround on this, hopefully it makes it into a release build soon."
