Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile looking into <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2481,>\u00a0I noticed this pattern:\r\n```java\n\r\nconst uint8_t* bytes_array = reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(input);\r\nauto buffer = std::make_shared<Buffer>(bytes_array, sizeof(float)*input_length);\n```\r\nIt's not the end of the world but\u00a0seems\u00a0a little verbose to me. It would be great to have something like this:\r\n```java\n\r\nauto buffer = MakeBuffer<float>(input, input_length);\n```\r\nI couldn't find it, does it already exist somewhere? Any thoughts on the API? Potentially specializations to make a buffer out of a std::vector<T> would also be helpful.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
