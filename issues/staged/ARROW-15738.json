Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen attempting to use a named pipe or FIFO as an OSFile an error is raised because the file handle is not seekable (lseek() fails).\r\n\r\nHaving the ability to use a named pipe as an OSFile rather than a PythonFile brings the advantages of no having to interact via the GIL in python.\r\n\r\nI propose that there be a way to create an OSFile that represents non-seekable streams, these would be very useful for csv.open_csv().\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
