Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere should be a few options:\r\n\r\n- Assume UTF8, but do not verify (\"no seatbelts mode\", for users that have reasonable security about UTF8 and want the maximum performance)\n  \n- Full UTF8 verification\n  \n- Maybe ASCII-only verification (because ASCII verification is very fast)",
