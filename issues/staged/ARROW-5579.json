Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nReported in a [github issue\\|[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/4489]]\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter some\u00a0[discussion](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/5368)\u00a0with the Flatbuffers maintainer, it appears that FB generated code is not guaranteed to be compatible with\u00a0_any other_\u00a0version of the runtime library other than the exact same version of the flatc used to compile it.\r\n\r\nThis makes depending on flatbuffers in a library (like arrow) quite risky, as if an app depends on any other version of FB, either directly or transitively, it's likely the versions will clash at some point and you'll see undefined behaviour at runtime.\r\n\r\nShading the dependency looks to me the best way to avoid this.",

User maven-shade-plugin and add include tags for flatbuffer\n1. Add relocations to rename the package.\n   \n   In the above PR, we use <exclude> tag and seems this plugin will not process this dependency?\n   \n   If we use relocations to rename packages it will cause new problems and I don't know how to solve:\n   \n   _/org/apache/arrow/vector/types/pojo/ArrowType.java:[239,46] \u9519\u8bef: \u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7c7b\u578b: com.google.flatbuffers.FlatBufferBuilder\u65e0\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a arrow.format.com.google.flatbuffers.FlatBufferBuilder_\n   \n   Seems the direct flatbuffer dependency in arrow-vector is not compatible with renamed dependency in arrow-format.\n   \n   What do you think?\n   \n   \u00a0"

I do have some new thoughts, I tried two different ways:\r\n\r\n1\u3001add arrow-shaded module and relocate package, then add this dependency in arrow-format instead of flatbuffers, but in flatbuffer-generated code the import is still origin package path and cause error.\r\n\r\n2\u3001Another approach is relocate package only in arrow-format since other modules depends on this and replace \"com.google.flatbuffers.**\" such imports with new relocated path such as \"arrow.format.com.google.flatbuffers.**\", in this way all arrow-related modules use the same flatbuffers and will not conflict with user applications. In this way, maven build fine but seems Intellij not support resolve shaded dependencies(see <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-93855>), so manually run tests still cause errors which is still a big problem.:(\r\n\r\nNew test code can be seen in my branch. Thanks"

I started working on this on a branch of my own https://github.com/emkornfield/arrow/tree/shade but I am running into a compilation issue with Flight, not sure if you have gotten past that on your branch?\r\n\r\nI think the first thing we should do is revert the initial PR, can you submit a PR for that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
