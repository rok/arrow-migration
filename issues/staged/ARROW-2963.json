        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2963](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2963). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe following code passes:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nimport os\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1]})\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\ndf = table.to_pandas(use_threads=False)\r\n\r\npid = os.fork()\r\nif pid != 0:\r\n    os.waitpid(pid, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the following code will never finish (the `waitpid` calls blocks forever, seems that the child process is frozen):\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nimport os\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1]})\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)\r\ndf = table.to_pandas(use_threads=True)\r\n\r\npid = os.fork()\r\nif pid != 0:\r\n    os.waitpid(pid, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(the only difference is `use_threads=True`)",
