Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the wake of ARROW-8792, this issue is to serve as an umbrella issue for follow up work and associated \"buildout\" which includes things like:\r\n\r\n- Implementation of many new function types and adding new kernel cases to existing functions\n- Adding implicit casting functionality to function execution\n- Creation of \"bound\" physical array expressions and execution thereof\n- Pipeline execution (executing multiple kernels while eliminating temporary allocation)\n- Parallel execution of scalar and aggregate kernels (including parallel execution of pipelined kernels)\n  \n  There's quite a few existing JIRAs in the project that I'll attach to this issue and I'll open plenty more issues as things occur to me to help organize the work.

This umbrella already has a large number of child issues, so\u00a0following the example of\u00a0ARROW-555, I am creating sub-umbrellas to cover specific areas of work under this larger umbrella. I have started by creating ARROW-12748 (arithmetic kernels for numeric arrays) which is linked as a child of this umbrella and has several child issues itself. Organizing issues into a hierarchical parent/child structure like this should improve legibility."
