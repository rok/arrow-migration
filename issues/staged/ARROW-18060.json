        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18060](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18060). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf the input data has no rows, no files get created. This is potentially unexpected as it looks like \"nothing happened\". It might be nicer to create an empty file. With partitioning, though, that then gets weird (there's no partition values) so maybe an error might make more sense instead.\r\n\r\nReproduction in Python\r\n```python\n\r\nimport tempfile\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow\r\nimport pyarrow.dataset\r\n\r\nprint(\"PyArrow version:\", pyarrow.__version__)\r\n\r\ntable = pyarrow.table([\r\n    [],\r\n], schema=pyarrow.schema([\r\n    (\"ints\", \"int64\"),\r\n]))\r\n\r\nwith tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:\r\n    pyarrow.dataset.write_dataset(table, d, format=\"feather\")\r\n    print(list(Path(d).iterdir()))\r\n```\r\nOutput\r\n```\n\r\n> python repro.py\r\nPyArrow version: 9.0.0\r\n[] \n```",
