        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10623](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10623). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n#### How to reproduce\r\n \\* Create a data frame:\r\n```\n\r\ndf <- data.frame(col1 = 1:100)\n```\r\n\r\n \\* Write it to parquet file using apache 2.0.0. The demo uses R 3.6 but same happens if you use R 4.0\r\n \\* Read the parquet file using apache 1.0.1. I only tried that in R 3.6\r\n\r\n#### Expected\r\n\r\nThe data frame is the same as it was before:\r\n```\n\r\nstructure(list(col1 = 1:100), row.names = c(NA, 100L), class = \"data.frame\")\n```\r\n#### Actual\r\n\r\nThe data frame has lost some information:\r\n```\n\r\nstructure(list(1:100), class = \"data.frame\")\n```\r\n#### Demo\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the easiest way is to put up a demo project for this, since you need to switch between arrow installations. But I've created this docker based demo:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/fdlk/arrow2/>",

Unfortunately the code in arrow 1.0 is seeing the new metadata written by 2.0 and erases the existing data.frame attributes but doesn't know how to restore correctly the new ones.\r\n\r\nA workaround for now would be to drop the metadata before converting to a data.frame, like:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\n# Using arrow 1.0.x\r\ntab <- read_parquet(\"file-written-by-arrow-2-0-0.parquet\", as_data_frame = FALSE)\r\ntab$metadata$r <- NULL\r\ndf <- as.data.frame(tab)\r\n```"
