Same error on all. I've seen in other issues that co-installations of tensorflow and numpy might be causing issues. I have tensorflow==1.14.0 and numpy==1.16.4 (and many other libraries, but I've read that those tend to cause issues)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nfrom pyarrow import parquet\r\n \r\n~/python/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py in <module>\r\n 32 import pyarrow as pa\r\n 33 import pyarrow.lib as lib\r\n---> 34 import pyarrow._parquet as _parquet\r\n 35 \r\n 36 from pyarrow._parquet import (ParquetReader, Statistics, # noqa\r\n~/python/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/_parquet.pyx in init pyarrow._parquet()\r\n\u00a0\r\nAttributeError: type object 'pyarrow._parquet.Statistics' has no attribute '__reduce_cython__'\r\n```\r\n``",
