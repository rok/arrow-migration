For dictionary deltas to be emitted, the dictionary in the subsequent records you write **must** be an extension of the previous dictionary that was written. The way you were creating the records you were creating them with two **entirely different** dictionaries. This can't work with deltas because the indices would be incorrect and can only work by doing dictionary replacement.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI merged my previous change in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18317 and rebased, then updated your test. If you could give me permissions to write to your fork, i'll push the branch. (You probably should have made a new branch to merge for the PR rather than using master on your fork :) )"
