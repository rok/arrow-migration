        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6312](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6312). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current arrow.pc package config file produced is deficient and doesn't properly declare static libraries pre-requisities that must be linked in in order to **statically** link in libarrow.a\r\n\r\nCurrently it just has:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Libs: -L${libdir} -larrow\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in cases, e.g. where you enabled snappy, brotli or zlib support in arrow, our toolchains need to see an arrow.pc file something more like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Libs: -L${libdir} -larrow\r\n Libs.private: -lsnappy -lboost_system -lz -llz4 -lbrotlidec -lbrotlienc -lbrotlicommon -lzstd\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf not, we get linkage errors.\u00a0 I'm told the convention is that if\u00a0the .a has an UNDEF, the Requires.private plus the Libs.private should resolve all the undefs. See the Libs.private info in\u00a0<https://linux.die.net/man/1/pkg-config>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote, however, as\u00a0Sutou Kouhei pointed out in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5123#issuecomment-522771452,>\u00a0the additional Libs.private need to be dynamically generated based on whether functionality like snappy, brotli or zlib is enabled..",
