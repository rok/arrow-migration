        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14428](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14428). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now, I can:\r\n```Java\n\r\nds <- open_dataset(\"some.parquet\")\r\nds %>% \r\n  mutate(\r\n    o_orderdate = cast(o_orderdate, date32())  \r\n  ) %>% \r\n  write_dataset(path = \"new.parquet\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I can't:\r\n```Java\n\r\ntab <- read_parquet(\"some.parquet\", as_data_frame = FALSE)\r\ntab %>% \r\n  mutate(\r\n    o_orderdate = cast(o_orderdate, date32())  \r\n  ) %>% \r\n  write_parquet(\"new.parquet\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, I can cast the column as a separate command and then `write_parquet()` after, but it would be nice to be able to us `write_parquet()` in a pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis will require a libarrow addition to / another version of WriteParquet that takes a RecordBatchReader instead of a fully-instantiated Table\r\n",
