        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13266](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13266). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI propose we make the following changes to the JS benchmark results, so that they are more parsable for Conbench. We'll also need to add suite name to the json results to disambiguate otherwise duplicate benchmark names.\r\n\r\n1) Rename `name` to `column`\r\n\r\n    ```Java\n\"name\": \"name: 'lat', length: 1,000,000, type: Float32\",\n```\r\n    \r\n    vs.\r\n    \r\n    ```Java\n\"name\": \"column: 'lat', length: 1,000,000, type: Float32\",\n```\r\n\r\n2) Add the suite name to the json results.\r\n\r\n2) Remove dataset name from the suite name, move it to the benchmark name. Conbench will split on the colons and store all the parameters (dataset, length, column, etc) as benchmark tags.\r\n",
