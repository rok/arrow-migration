Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor arrays with nulls, this amounts to returning the validity bitmap. Without nulls, an array of all 1 bits must be constructed. For isnull, the bits must be flipped (in this case, the un-set part of the new bitmap must stay 0, though).",
