        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1824](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1824). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current arrow::ipc::\\* such as RecordBatchStreamReader and RecordBatchStreamWriter don't work for RecordBatch on GPU. It's useful that they can process RecordBatch on GPU same as it on CPU with the same API.\r\n\r\nARROW-1808 may be required for implementing this feature.",
