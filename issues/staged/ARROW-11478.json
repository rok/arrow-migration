Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn Arrow 3.0.0, the `arrow.skip_nul` option effectively defaults to `FALSE`\u00a0for consistency with `base::readLines`\u00a0and `base::scan`.\r\n\r\nIf the user keeps this default option value, then conversion of string data containing embedded nuls causes an error with a message like:\r\n```java\n\r\nembedded nul in string: '\\0' \n```\r\nIf the user sets the option to `TRUE`, then no error occurs, but this warning is issued:\r\n```java\n\r\nStripping '\\0' (nul) from character vector \n```\r\nConsider whether we should:\r\n1. Keep this all as it is\n1. Change the default option value to `TRUE`\n1. Keep the default option value as it is, but catch the error and re-throw it with a more actionable message that tells the user how to set the option",
