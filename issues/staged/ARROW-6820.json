In C++ it is very confusing because many APIs are \"key\" and \"item\" because when MapArray is viewed as a list of structs, the term \"value\" would mean an element in the struct array. Also, there could be conflicts because \"value\" is already used in List APIs. I think we should stick with the terminology from Schema.fbs where map type is specified as having a child field \"entry\", itself with children \"key\" and \"value\". In C++ we could work around the API by overriding then renaming, e.g. ```Java\nstd::shared_ptr<Array> MapArray::list_values() { return ListArray::values(); }\n```"
