Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the arrow release-4.0.0 branch, the `compute::is_in` operation rejects duplicate values in the `value_set` [1]. This was not the case in arrow 2.0 >=.\r\n\u00a0\r\nI was wondering if this strict restriction is required? Because ultimately, a hash set would be created from the value_set values, and there's no harm in having duplicates while doing so, isn't it?\r\nPS: I understand that the param name \"value_set\" indicates that the values need to be unique, but in the useability perspective, this can be relaxed IMO. ex: Pandas isin [2].\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n[1] <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_set_lookup.cc#L53>\r\n[2] <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.isin.html>",
