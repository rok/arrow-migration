Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs `[~jorgecarleitao]` says on  https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9588#discussion_r584290701\r\n\r\nThe (Rust) Iterator spec recommends, but does not require, that the iterator reports a correct length. Consumer that lead to undefined behavior from an incorrect size_hint are the causers of said undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nThe only case where consumers can trust the iterators' length is when the interator implement unsafe trait TrustedLen. Unfortunately, TrustedLen is still in unstable. For that reason, we have been exposing unsafe Buffer::from_trusted_len_iter and the like for those cases.\r\n\r\nSo the code should be updated to handle the case where the reported `size_hint` turns out to be incorrect",
