Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe JS IPC writer is slicing the data and valueOffset buffers by starting from the data's current logical offset. This is incorrect, since the slice function already does this for the data, type, and valueOffset TypedArrays internally. PR incoming.",
