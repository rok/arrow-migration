        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9505). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHi,\u00a0 in this PyArrow structured array\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nstruct_array.slice(0,3)\r\nOut[52]: \r\n<pyarrow.lib.StructArray object at 0x7f92061e9dc0>\r\n-- is_valid: all not null\r\n-- child 0 type: int16\r\n [\r\n 991,\r\n 992,\r\n 993\r\n ]\r\n-- child 1 type: decimal(6, 3)\r\n [\r\n 36.100,\r\n 42.300,\r\n 15.300\r\n ]\r\n```\r\nI have tried to apply dictionary_encode() method and I got back this error\r\n```java\n\r\nstruct_array.dictionary_encode()\r\nFile \"<ipython-input-51-440741990dd7>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n struct_array.dictionary_encode()\r\n File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 750, in pyarrow.lib.Array.dictionary_encode\r\n File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 106, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowNotImplementedError: dictionary-encode not implemented for struct<catpid: int16, catcost: decimal(6, 3)>\u00a0\r\n```\r\nI also tried to define a struct_array type with dictionary encode data types and you get the same error.\r\n\r\nI know that it is possible to apply dictionary_encode() to each field of the struct_array and you can create a RecordBatch from the dictionary encoded fields of the array. So I am not sure why this functionality is not implemented.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that there is a transformation RecordBatch.from_struct_array() but I want the columns to be dictionary encoded and the only way to do this in the current PyArrow version is to process each field, column separately.\r\n\r\nBTW: One of the\u00a0basic problems I am addressing In the project I my working on is how to transform tuples from any database table to dictionary encoded columns of a PyArrow RecordBatch (Table).\u00a0",
