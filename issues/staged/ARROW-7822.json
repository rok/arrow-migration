Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`Status::state_` could be made a tagged pointer without affecting the fast path (passing around a non error status). The extra bit could be used to mark a Status' state as heap allocated or not, allowing very error statuses to be extremely cheap when their error state is known to be immutable. For example, this would allow a cheap default of `Result<>::status_`.",

That would indicate that Status is being used inappropriately for control flow. Unless I have misunderstood the issue?"
