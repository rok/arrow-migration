        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10709](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10709). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is an option to do efficient data transport using file.read_buffer() using zero memory copies (benchmarking have confirmed that, very nice!).\r\n\r\nHowever, file.read_buffer() when backed by a Python object (via PythonFile), will call PythonFile.read() via\u00a0PyReadableFile::Read. A 'normal' file.read() that does memory copying, also calls the PythonFile.read() method, but only allows for a bytes object (PyBytes_Check is used in\u00a0PyReadableFile::Read).\r\nThis makes it hard to create 1 file object in Python land that supports normal .read() (and thus needs to returns a bytes object) and to also support a zero-copy route where .read() can return a memory view.\r\nPossibly the strict check on\u00a0PyBytes_Check can me lifted by also allowing trying\u00a0PyObject_GetBuffer.",
