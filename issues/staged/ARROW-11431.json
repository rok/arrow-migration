        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11431). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe do not yet have support for the SQL `HAVING` clause. `HAVING` is used to filter post-aggregation, typically against an aggregated column. For example:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nSELECT c1, MAX(c2) FROM t GROUP BY c1 HAVING MAX(c2) > 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n`HAVING` expressions need not reference aggregates in the `SELECT`, for example:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nSELECT c1, MAX(c2) FROM t GROUP BY c1 HAVING MIN(c2) > 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n`HAVING` expressions need not filter on aggregated columns, for example:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nSELECT c1, MAX(c2) FROM t GROUP BY c1 HAVING c1 > 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, `HAVING` expressions need not be used in conjunction with a `GROUP BY`, for example: \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nSELECT MAX(c1) FROM t HAVING MAX(c1) > 100\r\n```",
