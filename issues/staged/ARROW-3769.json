Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf the goal is to hash this data anyway into a categorical-type array, then it would be better to offer the option to \"push down\" the hashing into the Parquet read hot path rather than first fully materializing a dense vector of `ByteArray` values, which could use a lot of memory after decompression",

This is only implemented at the encoder level, so you should be able to use `ArrayFromJSON` to make writing the unit tests easier \u2013 so for this JIRA I am expecting tests in `parquet-encoding-test`"
