Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSpeaking with `[~wesmckinn]`, it would be really helpful to have Kerberos support in our HDFS logic. This should be straightforward; I would just need to switch to `hdfsBuilderConnect()` in the shim.\n\nOn a side note, is there a reason we aren't using Pivotal's libhdfs3? It uses RPCs natively rather than JNI.\n\nhttps://github.com/Pivotal-Data-Attic/pivotalrd-libhdfs3\n\nDask has Python wrappers for this.\n\nhttps://github.com/dask/hdfs3\n",

Meanwhile, a new official C++ HDFS client is in the works, see HDFS-8707. If there is a bug we cannot really count on the Apache Hadoop community to fix it. \n\nBecause libhdfs3 is mostly API compatible with libhdfs if someone will do the work we could add an option to switch between libhdfs and libhdfs3 in the HdfsClient factory function.
