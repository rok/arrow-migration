Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be useful to be able to collect statistics (e.g. distinct value counts) about values in a column of a CSV file that cannot be converted to a desired data type. \r\n\r\nWhen conversion fails, the converters can call into an abstract API like\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nstatistics_->CannotConvert(token, size);\r\n```\r\n\r\nor something similar",
