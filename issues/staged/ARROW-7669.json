Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome AppVeyor entries build in release mode (for example MinGW, R). We should try to turn compiler optimizations off (e.g. by passing a CXXFLAGS) to make those entries faster.\r\n",
