Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have the following in my data:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nv = new Uint32Array([4294786450, 4294967295, 4294967295, 4294967295]) \n```\r\nbignumToNumber converts this to -18446744069414765000 but it should be -180846.\r\n\r\nI actually suspect that bignumToNumber fails on anything greater than 64 bits, but I don't have any positive test cases.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
