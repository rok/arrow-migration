        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18170](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18170). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen building the new wheels for Python 3.11 I had to modify the version of numpy manually only on python/requirements-wheel-test.txt. See: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14499>\r\n\r\nWe are using `oldest-supported-numpy` everywhere else so I think this could be refactored to simplify the requirements-wheel-test.txt file.\r\n\r\nI am opening this ticket as a follow up from this conversation: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14499/files#r1005619591> See other PRs comment like a proposed patch and test failures as an initial investigation.",

It is not needed to test with oldest-supported-numpy, since the goal of that is that it should also work on more recent versions. I am not sure why we are complex test requirements file for numpy. I _would_ think we could just list \"numpy\" to get the latest numpy version that is available for the particular platform."
