        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1309](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1309). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have an avro file in hdfs that I am reading in using fastavro, converting to a pandas dataframe and then trying to create an arrow table and get as error:\n\n>>> table=pyarrow.Table.from_pandas(my_dataframe)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"pyarrow/table.pxi\", line 746, in pyarrow.lib.Table.from_pandas (/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.6/lib.cxx:34089)\n  File \"pyarrow/table.pxi\", line 346, in pyarrow.lib._dataframe_to_arrays (/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.6/lib.cxx:30476)\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 182, in pyarrow.lib.Array.from_pandas (/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.6/lib.cxx:22110)\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 66, in pyarrow.lib.check_status (/arrow/python/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.6/lib.cxx:7702)\npyarrow.lib.ArrowNotImplementedError: NotImplemented: null\n\nThe avro schema indeed has null fields possible.  Is this not implemented?  I am using pyarrow 0.5.0.  Also, for what I am doing I am not using pandas at all, I just read in the avro and I have a list of dicts and really want to write them to disk in parquet format and am utilizing these steps (which isn't optimal but may be necessary without writing more code of my own).\n\nthanks,\nLuke",

Any chance you can show the input data that triggered this error? There should be a single column in the data frame that is causing the problem (it's getting passed to `pyarrow.Array.from_pandas`)\n\nIf it's not possible to fix this immediately, we would definitely want to make the error message more informative than that"

There were columns with only value of None, is that the issue? Is it the optional fields in avro causing the issue? There were probably columns which were mostly empty but a few filled.  More when I can on the 15th. Sorry for the delay."
