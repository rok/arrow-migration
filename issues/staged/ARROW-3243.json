        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3243](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3243). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIs it possible/feasible to upgrade jemalloc to version 5 and assume that version? I'm asking because I've been working towards replacing dlmalloc in plasma with jemalloc, which makes some of the code much nicer and removes some of the issues we had with dlmalloc, but it requires jemalloc APIs that are only available starting from jemalloc version 5, in particular, I'm using the extent_hooks_t capability.\r\n\r\nFor now I can submit a patch that uses a different version of jemalloc in plasma and then we can figure out how to deal with it (maybe there is a way to make it work with older versions). What are your thoughts?",

Sadly jemalloc 5 had some changes that made it unusable in the `manylinux1` setting. It could be that these are resolved, then we could switch to a newer version. You can simply try this by changing the installation script. Otherwise we probably have to wait until we have changed our wheel to be based on `manylinux2010`."
