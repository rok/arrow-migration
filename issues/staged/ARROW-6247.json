Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe want to provide an interface for floating point vectors (float4 & float8). This interface will make it convenient for many operations on a vector. With this interface, the client code will be greatly simplified, with many branches/switch removed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe design is similar to BaseIntVector (the interface for all integer vectors). We provide 3 methods for setting & getting floating point values:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 setWithPossibleTruncate\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 setSafeWithPossibleTruncate\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 getValueAsDouble",
