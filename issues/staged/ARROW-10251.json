Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMemTable::load() should load partitions in parallel using async tasks, rather than loading one partition at a time.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should make batch size configurable. It is currently hard-coded to 1024\\*1024 which can be quite inefficient.",
