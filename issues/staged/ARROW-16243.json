We should remove it and it's corresponding Python method.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/cedb4f8112b9c622dad88e0b6e8e0600f7e52746/cpp/src/parquet/arrow/reader.h#L143-L156",

For nested columns, both are different, as Parquet counts the final child leaves, while Arrow counts the top-level parent leaves)\r\n\r\nThe column indices you pass to eg `ReadTable` are parquet-based column indices.
