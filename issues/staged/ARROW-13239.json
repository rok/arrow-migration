Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that some function signatures are wrongly reported in the autogenerated reference.\r\n\r\nI found at least one instance in `pyarrow.dataset.Dataset.head` which is documented as a function without any argument ( https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.dataset.Dataset.html#pyarrow.dataset.Dataset.head ) but in reality it requires one argument ( https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/_dataset.pyx#L477 )\r\n\r\nI tested also by building documentation locally and the argument is not listed.",

For example, the `Table` reference documentation correctly includes the arguments in the signature, so it seems dataset.pyx related."
