Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `pyarrow.filesystem` and `pyarrow.hdfs` filesystems have been deprecated in 2.0.0, and changed from Deprecation to FutureWarning in 4.0.0. I think it is time to actually remove them, and I would propose to do so in 8.0.0",
