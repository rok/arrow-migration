Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe use the AWS SDK async APIs in some places in S3FileSystem, but all they do is spawn a separate thread and run the sync API in it.\r\n\r\nInstead we should use our IO executor, which would:\r\n1) put an upper bound on the number of threads started\r\n2) (presumably) reduce latency by reusing threads instead of spawning a throwaway thread for each async call\r\n3) allow for cancellation\r\n",
