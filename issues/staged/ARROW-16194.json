Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe file readers generally have some kind of capability to either read or process data in parallel.  We should make sure the documentation is clear on the capabilities of the various readers as it can help users understand what to expect (e.g. do they need to do their own parallelism on top of ours?).",
