        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13683](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13683). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe're already building Arrow C++ with the UCRT toolchain (including gcc 10) in the Rtools40 build, but we aren't testing the R bindings and the whole package with it. https://github.com/r-windows/docs/blob/master/ucrt.md has instructions for how to download the UCRT R; any download and setup probably should happen in (or be upstreamed to) https://github.com/r-lib/actions/issues/340. \r\n\r\nThere is already a CRAN check for UCRT, so we have some limited exposure by not having CI for it. Adding a job would also allow us to reproduce the link error Jeroen observed on ARROW-9616. ",
