        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12760](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12760). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn Arrow 4, I'm not able to get more than 8 thread parallelism (for example when N threads call fs.ls() with different paths) for S3FileSystem created with pyarrow, because the default IO context is created with 8 thread limit (hardcoded), and I don't see a way to change this or pass a custom IO context through pyarrow APIs. I believe this affects other Arrow filesystem implementations as well.",
