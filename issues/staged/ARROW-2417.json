Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Rust library makes a lot of use of unsafe calls. We should review the API to see if any methods we expose should be marked unsafe or whether we need to add assertions to make APIs safe.\r\n\r\nWe should also add more unit tests around this.",
