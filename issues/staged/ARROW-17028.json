Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nParquet already supports RLE data. So this would involve adding a new (optional) code path that this data can be directly read into the new Arrow RLE arrays, without decoding it.",
