What is needed to add support for nanosecond timestamps in Rust Parquet?",

The nanosecond type is part of the 2.6 format, which we don't fully support yet.\r\n\r\nThere's 3 tasks,\u00a0\r\n1. Wire up the 2.6 changes in the parquet-format, it's clear that we're missing an enum (there might be more that's missing)\n1. Add a reader for ts-nano\n1. Add a writer for ts-nano, that uses the old int96 writer if the legacy support is requested, or uses the new ts-nano for non-legacy types\n   \n   Would you like to contribute some of the above? I can help out with 1 as a start.\n   \n   Thanks"
