Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have a significant amount effort put into round tripping expressions and types but we don't yet have support for relations and plans.  Doing so would make it possible to do things like save off Arrow exec plans created by non-substrait means (for example, to save off a plan created by pyarrow or R's current non-substrait dplyr implementation).\r\n\r\nIt would also help with testing as it would enable more round-trip testing.",
