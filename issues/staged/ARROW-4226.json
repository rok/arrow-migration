Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2546#pullrequestreview-156064172>\r\n> Perhaps in the future, if zero-copy and future-proof-ness is really what we want, we might want to add the CSF (compressed sparse fiber) format, a generalisation of CSR/CSC. I'm currently working on adding it to PyData/Sparse, and I plan to make it the preferred format (COO will still be around though).",
