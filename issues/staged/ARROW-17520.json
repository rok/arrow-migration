Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe SetRel operator in Substrait is a critical operator to merge data from several branches in the query plan. The operator has a few options like MINUS, INTERSECTION and UNION. The UNIONALL option that directly merges data flows is the foundation of other options and is easier to implement. As I know, Acero already has the union operator and we could easily map the UNIONALL in Substrait to the Union operator in Acero.",
