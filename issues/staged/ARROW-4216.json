Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince parsing the CUDA API docstrings would require building Arrow with CUDA enabled, it would be better to make it conditional, for example using the [ifconfig](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/ifconfig.html) Sphinx extension.",
