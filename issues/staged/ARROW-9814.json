Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis seems to happen with some Minio versions, but is definitely a problem in Arrow.\r\nThe crash message says:\r\n```Java\n\r\npyarrow/tests/test_parquet.py::test_read_partitioned_directory_s3fs[False] ../src/arrow/dataset/discovery.cc:188:  Check failed: relative.has_value() GetFileInfo() yielded path outside selector.base_dir\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem is that we pass a full URI for the selector base_dir (such as \"s3://bucket/path.\") and the S3 filesystem implementation then returns regular paths (such as \"bucket/path/foo/bar\").\r\n\r\nI think we should do two things:\r\n1) error out rather than crash (and include the path strings in the error message), which would be more user-friendly\r\n2) fix the issue that full URIs are passed in base_dir",
