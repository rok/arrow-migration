        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8824](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8824). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently depend on the sqlparser crate that I originally created but has moved on since the version we use and that project is aiming to support multiple SQL dialects and I don't think it is appropriate for what we need in DataFusion.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to build a new SQL parser as part of the DataFusion crate so that we can more easily maintain it, and it can use Arrow as the native type system.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to try and donate the sqlparser 0.2.x code base but there are a fair number of committers and it is probably easier just to implement it from scratch (without referencing the existing code).\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

We just need to work on having the sqlparser sufficiently generic to support the different operations that we desire."
