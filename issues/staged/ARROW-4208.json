Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently We don't run S3 integration tests regularly. \r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n- mock it within python/pytest\n- simply run the s3 tests with an S3 credential provided\n- create a hdfs-integration like docker-compose setup and run an S3 mock server (e.g.: https://github.com/adobe/S3Mock, https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3, https://github.com/gaul/s3proxy, https://github.com/jserver/mock-s3)\n  \n  For more see discussion https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3286",

Do we have regression examples?"
