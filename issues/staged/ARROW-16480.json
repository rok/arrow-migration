        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16480](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16480). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom a discussion on a PR which documents the encoding argument (<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13038)>\r\n\r\nCurrently if we want to specify Arrow-specific read options such as encoding, we'd have to do something like this:\r\n```java\n\r\ndf <- read_csv_arrow(tf, read_options = CsvReadOptions$create(encoding = \"utf8\")) \n```\r\nHowever, this uses a lower-level API that we don't want to include in the examples for end-users to see.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe should update the code inside `read_csv_arrow()` so that the user can specify `read_options` as a list which we then pass through to CsvReadOptions internally, so we could instead call the much more user-friendly code below:\r\n```java\n\r\ndf <- read_csv_arrow(tf, read_options = list(encoding = \"utf8\")) \n```\r\nWe should then add an example of this to the function doc examples.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe also should do the same for parse_options and convert_options.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we can do:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nopen_dataset(\"data.csv\", format = \"csv\", convert_options = CsvConvertOptions$create(null_values = \"Not Range\", strings_can_be_null = TRUE))%>% collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it'd be great to be able to do:\r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nopen_dataset(\"data.csv\", format = \"csv\", convert_options = list(null_values = \"Not Range\", strings_can_be_null = TRUE))%>% collect()\r\n```\r\n",
