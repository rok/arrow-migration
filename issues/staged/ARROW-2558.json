        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2558](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2558). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently plasma stores list-of-clients in ObjectTableEntry, which is used to track which clients are using a given object, this serves for two purposes:\r\n- If an object is in use.\n- If the client trying to abort an object is the one who created it.\n  \n  A problem with list-of-clients approach is that when a client disconnects, we need to walk through all the objects and remove the client pointer from the list for each object.\n  \n  Instead, we could add a reference count in ObjectTableEntry, and store list-of-object-ids in client structure. This could both goals that the original approach is targeting, while when a client disconnects, it just walk through its object-ids and dereference each ObjectTableEntry, there's no need to walk through all objects.",
