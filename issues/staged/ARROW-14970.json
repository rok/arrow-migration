I think this is a good idea but I'd like to avoid task-per-node (although that could be an acceptable stepping stone).  One way we can do this (inspired by work from `[~aocsa]`) is change InputReceived from:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nvoid InputReceived(ExecNode* input, ExecBatch batch)\r\n```\r\n\r\nto something like...\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nvoid InputReceived(ExecNode* input, std::function<void(ExecBatch)> task)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA \"terminating node\" (e.g. sink node / pipeline breaker) could then submit the task.  A \"non-terminating node\" (e.g. filter/project/etc.) could wrap the task with its own work (function composition) and call InputReceived on the downstream node.\r\n\r\nThere are probably other ways to do this as well."
