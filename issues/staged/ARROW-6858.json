Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the C++ build system, we are handling relationships between optional components in an ad hoc fashion\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d5ba83eebfaf0652ff5f96f943a3d99d5de96dd2/cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L266\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem ideal. \r\n\r\nAs discussed on the mailing list, I suggest declaring dependencies in a Python data structure and then generating and checking in a .cmake file that can be `include`d. This will be a big easier than maintaining this on an ad hoc basis. ",
