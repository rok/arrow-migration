Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe generic filesystem tests assert that reading a directory should fail.  If directories are implemented as described in ARROW-15114 this would be expensive to implement (at least in the near future), as it would require two roundtrips to the service to fetch the object metadata.\r\n\r\nI would rather change the generic tests to allow reading directories, and if we find a cheaper way to fix this later we can restore the tests.",
