        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-665](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-665). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of doing this in e.g. the builders, we should move this logic to the Allocator. For example, jemalloc provides a flag `MALLOCX_ZERO` to indicate that an allocated region should be zeroed. The POSIX API also provides the (sadly unaligned) `calloc` call that returns zeroed pages. \n\nThe speciality here is that the pages may already be zeroed by the OS for security reasons (i.e. so that one process does not see the content of the process that previously owned this page).",
