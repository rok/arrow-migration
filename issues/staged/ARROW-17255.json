Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a BigQuery developer, I would like the Arrow libraries to support the JSON logical Type. This would enable us to use the JSON type in the Arrow format of our ReadAPI. This would also enable us to use the JSON type to export data from BigQuery to Parquet.",

There have been other such discussions on 'common' extension types like UUIDs. "
