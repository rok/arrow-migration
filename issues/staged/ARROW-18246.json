        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18246](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18246). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHello, thank you for all the amazing work on Arrow! I'd like to report a potential issue with PyArrow's Table Join docstring which may make it confusing for others to read. This content is I believe translated into the documentation website as well.\r\n\r\nThe content which needs to be corrected may be found starting at: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/table.pxi#L4737>\r\n\r\nThe block currently reads:\r\n```java\n\r\nleft_suffix : str, default None\r\nWhich suffix to add to right column names. This prevents confusion\r\nwhen the columns in left and right tables have colliding names.\r\nright_suffix : str, default None\r\nWhich suffic to add to the left column names. This prevents confusion\r\nwhen the columns in left and right tables have colliding names.\n```\r\n\r\nIt could be improved with the following:\r\n```java\n\r\nleft_suffix : str, default None\r\nWhich suffix to add to left column names. This prevents confusion\r\nwhen the columns in left and right tables have colliding names.\r\nright_suffix : str, default None\r\nWhich suffix to add to the right column names. This prevents confusion\r\nwhen the columns in left and right tables have colliding names.\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I may clarify or if there are any questions on the above. Thanks again for your help!\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
