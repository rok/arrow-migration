Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn [TestScalarAppendUnsafe](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/56e72ba09c3d886c6a5aeb11fb1642af13819f93/cpp/src/arrow/array-test.cc#L1497),\u00a0AppendNull is called to modify the bitmask which is not unsafe- it reserves at least one more element. UnsafeAppendNull should be used instead.\r\n\r\nSince PoolBuffers round their capacities up to multiples of 64 bytes, no buffer is ever in danger of overflowing in this test anyway. More repetitions should be used so that the test will fail if insufficient storage is allocated. More storage should be allocated in the test, too- currently only a single iteration's worth is allocated.",
