Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the HDFS connector library, there are per-platform preprocessor directives to determine which libjvm and libhdfs binaries to use for file operations. This is currently (3.0.0) failing due to an incorrect preprocessor directive for Windows. The code is referring to \"__WIN32\" while the properly defined variable should be \"_WIN32\" (see\u00a0https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/predefined-macros?view=msvc-160)",
