Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-15366 added a script to automatically increment the version switchers for the docs, which was updated as part of the changes in ARROW-15555.\u00a0 However, the latest release did not increment the version numbers (and ARROW-15555 changes the script to update on snapshots instead of releases - could be the reason for it not happening?)",
