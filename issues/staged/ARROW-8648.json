        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8648](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8648). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the Rust CI workflows (rust_build.sh, rust_test.sh), there are some build options used that are at odds with each other, resulting in multiple redundant builds where a smaller number could do the same job. The following tweaks, at minimal, could reduce this, speeding up build times:\r\n \\* Ensure that RUSTFLAGS=\"-D warnings\" is used for all cargo commands. Currently, it's only used for a single command (the `build --all-targets` in `rust_build.sh`). Subsuquent runs of cargo will ignore this first build, since RUSTFLAGS has changed.\r\n \\* Don't run\u00a0examples in release mode, as that would force a new (and slower) rebuild, when the examples have already been built in debug mode.",
