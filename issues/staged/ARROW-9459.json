Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee some timing checks here: https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/6346#issuecomment-656548675\r\n\r\nParsing all statistics, even from a centralized `_metadata` file, can be quite expensive. If you know in advance that you are not going to use them (eg you are only going to do filtering on the partition fields, and otherwise read all data), it could be nice to have an option to disable parsing statistics.\r\n\r\ncc `[~rjzamora]` `[~bkietz]` `[~fsaintjacques]`",

(ParquetFileFormat)"
