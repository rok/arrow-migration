Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDecimal benchmark mixes `+-*/` operations in one test loop[1]. Divide always dominates the result. It's ~6x slower than multiplication, let alone addition.\r\nIt's better to test division, multiplication, addition/subtraction separately to get more reasonable results.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/util/decimal_benchmark.cc#L141-L145",
