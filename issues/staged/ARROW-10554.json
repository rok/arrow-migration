        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10554](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10554). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTHis isn't a major issue/ or even one at all.\r\n\r\nI was wondering how guys are looking towards using a non-cryptographic hash function (aHash seems to be very fast) as default for Schema (and maybe other locations in crate).\r\n\r\nArrow currently defaults to the default HashMap and HashSet. This uses a cryptographic hasher, which I believe isn't needed most of the time. This extra security has quite some performance overhead.",
