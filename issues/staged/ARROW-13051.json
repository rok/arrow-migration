Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe produce java jars using a crossbow tasks. Ideally we should download and deploy these packages instead of compiling them locally during the java post release task.\r\n\r\nSee the produced jars at: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/releases/tag/actions-496-github-java-jars\r\nSee more context at: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10411\r\n",

I will change the <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/post-11-java.sh>\u00a0file to download the jars.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have two questions about the task:\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - How should I choose the link to download the jars files? Should I need to download from the last nightly build?\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 - The crossbow builds only generate the jars files, right? I will need to generate the\u00a0**pom**\u00a0\\*\u00a0\\*and\u00a0**sources**\u00a0files, for example,\u00a0 in the release script, right?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!"

I tried to locate the pom and source files as well but the [2 patterns](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/java-jars/github.yml#L102) doesn't seem to match those files (or we don't generate them at the first place). All the newly generated files should be added to the [expected artifacts of the java-jar task](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/tasks/tasks.yml#L638).\r\n\r\n3: In order to download from artifactory, we need to upload them first :)\r\nThe upload is triggered by the [05-binary-upload.sh script](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/05-binary-upload.sh) which will eventually require some ruby. I should be straightforward by duplicating the python related methods, see [binary-task.rb](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/binary-task.rb#L1662-L1668) (cc `[~kou]`). \r\n\r\n4: We'll need to download the artifacts from artifactory, see the rest of the post release tasks. For example see the python one: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/post-10-python.sh#L35-L41\r\n\r\n"
