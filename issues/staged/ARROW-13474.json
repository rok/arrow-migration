        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13474](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13474). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyArrow is crashing when applying `filter` or `take` on already empty extension arrays.\r\n\r\nThe bug can be reproduced with the documentation example:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\nclass Point3DArray(pa.ExtensionArray):\r\n    def to_numpy_array(self):\r\n        return self.storage.flatten().to_numpy().reshape((-1, 3))\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Point3DType(pa.PyExtensionType):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        pa.PyExtensionType.__init__(self, pa.list_(pa.float32(), 3))\r\n\r\n    def __reduce__(self):\r\n        return Point3DType, ()\r\n\r\n    def __arrow_ext_class__(self):\r\n        return Point3DArray\r\n\r\nstorage = pa.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], pa.list_(pa.float32(), 3))\r\narr = pa.ExtensionArray.from_storage(Point3DType(), storage)\r\narr = arr.filter(pa.array([False, False]))\r\n\r\n# Crashing here...\r\narr.filter(pa.array([], pa.bool_()))\r\n# Crashing as well...\r\narr.take(pa.array([], pa.int32()))\n```\r\nThe underlying issue seems to be that the function `nulls` is not implemented for extension types in the C++ codebase:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/6db88a9e946c98c59f179210a70bc05ef6a0a296/cpp/src/arrow/array/util.cc#L472>",

Next two weeks are a bit busy for me, hopefully after I will get a bit more time. There are a couple of methods not supported currently by PyArrow on extension types (e.g. nulls, concat_arrays, combine_chunks) that I would be interested in implementing for our internal tooling at FiveAI."
