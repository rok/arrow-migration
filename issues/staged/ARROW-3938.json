Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3096#issuecomment-444345068\r\n\r\nI want to stop the current version sharing style. (Referring `java/pom.xml` from C++, Python, C, Ruby, ....)\r\nIt introduces complexity. For example, we generates `version.rb` dynamically to create a Ruby package: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ruby/red-arrow/version.rb\r\n\r\nI think that we can just replace all versions in `cpp/CMakeLists.txt`, `python/setup.py`, `c_glib/configure.ac`, `ruby/*/lib/*/version.rb`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, ... by `sed` in the release process.",
