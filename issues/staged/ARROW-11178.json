        "title": "[Rust] StructArray: handling duplicate field names",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11178](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11178). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe arrow spec leaves the solution of `duplicate field names` to implementors.\r\n\r\nThe C++'s solution: ignore or raise error, the Java's solution: ignore, append, replace or raise error. Both use ignore as the default. Here is the references:\r\n \\* <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/57376d28cf433bed95f19fa44c1e90a780ba54e8/cpp/src/arrow/type.cc>\r\n \\* <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/25c736d48dc289f457e74d15d05db65f6d539447/java/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/vector/complex/AbstractStructVector.java>\r\n\r\nI'm not expert at database or data science, but as far as I know, in the traditional RDBMS domain, it's unusual to allow duplicate field names. Further more, in the data analysis domain, perhaps it's usual to normalize/clean various kind of bad/dirty data **interactively** with tools like `pandas`?\r\n\r\nBack to the problem, I have an example: given duplicate field names A A A B B, the user who knows actual data MAY choose to: replace first A with second A and append third A, and ignore second B. Or the duplication was just mistake?\r\n\r\nQuote from [~nevi_me]: \"I also prefer raising an error by default, as that'll make users aware very quickly\". Is not acceptable if we silently append/ignore/replace duplicate fields, resulting unexpected results that user does not aware at all.\r\n\r\nIf we choose to support `replace`, `ignore` or `append`, at least we must let user control the exact behavior.\u00a0 For IPC data, perhaps custom metadata (for file, message and field) is the only choice. I suggest just record this problem here, keep raising error until it's really necessary to support other solutions.",
