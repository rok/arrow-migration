Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMany of the nightly builds are failing (e.g. https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/7942883382?check_suite_focus=true#step:5:24666) due to a test which conditionally runs based on the version of string available.  This is due to an NSE function we have implemented which is only in the dev version of stringr, and we expected to be included in the next release but was not.",
