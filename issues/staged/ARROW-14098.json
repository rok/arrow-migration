DATEDIFF returns the number of boundaries crossed.  For example, DATEDIFF(00:00:00, 23:59:59, HOURS) would yield \"1\" and this kernel yields 1 second.\r\n\r\nOther than the semantic meaning:\r\n\r\nDATEDIFF returns an integer, this returns a duration\r\nDATEDIFF requires taking the time zone into account for timestamps with time zones, this kernel would not."
