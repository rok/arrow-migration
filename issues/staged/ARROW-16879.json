Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFollowup to ARROW-16510. That PR added the bindings and basic R tests that don't require a live GCS connection. GCS has a \"testbench\" service you can run on localhost to test, like how we use minio to test S3. See the Python bindings PR for reference on how to set it up and run it, as well as some tests we could add: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12763",
