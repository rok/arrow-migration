Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe List vector defines it's offset vector as UInt4Vector. (unsigned int 34)\nAccording to the arrow spec it should be a signed int32.",

However we already support unsigned types and the java implementation already uses an unsigned vector for this.\nThoughts?\n\n`[~jnadeau]`, `[~sphillips]`: I see that the Accessor and Mutator for UInt4Vector use the java type int for values. How is the evaluation of an expression on such an unsigned value in a signed type interpreted?"

The java code uses signed ints everywhere (except the char vector, where java supports an unsigned 2 byte value). The Uint vectors are incomplete. Given the issues with Java and using unsigned values, I think we should stick with signed."
