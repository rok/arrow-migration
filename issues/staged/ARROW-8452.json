        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8452](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8452). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that when generating JSON integration data for a nested type, e.g.\r\n\"list(int32)\", the list's nullable flag is also inherited by child fields. This is wrong, because child fields have independent nullable flags, e.g. you may have:\r\n- \"list(field(\"ints\", int32, nullable=True), nullable=True)\"\n- \"list(field(\"ints\", int32, nullable=False), nullable=True)\"\n- \"list(field(\"ints\", int32, nullable=True), nullable=False)\"\n- \"list(field(\"ints\", int32, nullable=False), nullable=False)\"\n",
