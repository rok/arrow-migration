Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor floating types, sum kernel returns NaN if there's at least one NaN in the input array.\r\n It's useful to provide an option to ignore NaN(treat as 0) in summing, similar to [numpy.nansum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nansum.html).",

Of course the issue title is general about adding options, so we can add an option for NaNs as well, but just to point out that skipping NaNs hasn't really been discussed yet (and IMO it should be separate from skipping nulls)."
