The functions are generated at import time. Is there a function that doesn't exist if you `import pyarrow.compute` ?"

If I use `import pyarrow.compute` I can only use functions from the above referenced file, no function from docs is present. Have tried on Linux and macOS. Installed using pip 22.1.2.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt's straightforward to reproduce:\r\n```\r\n\r\npip install pyarrow\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow.compute as pc\r\n\r\npc.<Good luck to find the needed function :)>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u00a0"
