        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18006](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18006). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf we partition on a character-string column that is \"integer-like\", arrow assumes the resulting partition variable is an integer.\u00a0 This is particularly surprising because in most other cases, making a column a partition variable coerces it to a character (makes sense, path names are strings), but in this case we have the opposite coercion where a string becomes an integer.\u00a0 Consider this reprex:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)f <- tempfile()\r\ndf <- data.frame(x = c(\"00\", \"06\", \"18\"))\r\ndf |> write_dataset(f, partitioning = \"x\")\r\nopen_dataset(f) # x is now an integer\n```\r\n```java\n\r\n## fails\r\nopen_dataset(f) |> filter(x == \"00\")\r\n \n```\r\nchanging this behavior could break existing code I think, so maybe this shouldn't be considered a bug, but I think it merits discussion. \r\n\r\n(For instance, we often see large datasets, e.g. from NOAA csv etc, that use zero-padded integers in path names to indicate file-specific metadata.\u00a0 One side effect of the type-coercion is that it also strips\u00a0 the zero-padding)",
