        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7422](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7422). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nImproper CPU flags failing build in-spite of routines explicitly checking whether compiler supports those flags. Since pyarrow package in the pip has configuration errors, building from the source is the only option but the installation fails due to several issues, this being one of them.\r\n\r\nHad to manually remove SSE4, AltiVec related flags from the\u00a0**DefineOptions.cmake**\u00a0&\u00a0**SetupCxxFlags.cmake**\u00a0to avoid this error in-spite of routines to check whether compiler can handle this flags.\r\n\r\nThere are other errors after doing this(they don't seem to be related to CPU flags, so I have opened separate issue).\r\n\r\nLog is in the external issue URL.",

But, if I use sudo -E to export env vars from the build session this error doesn't occur.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are similar errors such as the one I've posted here on the github, since there's not clear evidence of an error within the project I'll close this as 'Not A Bug'.\r\n\r\nI've written a [gist](https://gist.github.com/heavyinfo/04e1326bb9bed9cecb19c2d603c8d521)\u00a0detailing all the setups needed to build and install arrow, pyarrow in ARM if anyone needed."
