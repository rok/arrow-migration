Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAlso out of discussion on <https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/12371>\r\n\r\nYou can unify schemas between different parquet files, but it seems like you can't union together two (or more) datasets that have different schemas. This is odd, because we do compute the unified schema on\u00a0[this line](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/ba0814e60a451525dd5492b68059aad8a4bdaf4f/r/R/dataset.R#L189), only to later assert all the schemas are the same.\r\n\r\n```R\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\ndf1 <- arrow_table(x = array(c(1, 2, 3)),\r\n                   y = array(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")))\r\ndf2 <- arrow_table(x = array(c(4, 5)),\r\n                   z = array(c(\"d\", \"e\")))\r\n\r\ndf1 %>% write_dataset(\"example1\", format=\"parquet\")\r\ndf2 %>% write_dataset(\"example2\", format=\"parquet\")\r\n\r\nds1 <- open_dataset(\"example1\", format=\"parquet\")\r\nds2 <- open_dataset(\"example2\", format=\"parquet\")\r\n\r\n# These don't work\r\nds <- c(ds1, ds2) # c() actually does the same thing\r\nds <- open_dataset(list(ds1, ds2)) # This fails due to mismatch in schema\r\nds <- open_dataset(c(\"example1\", \"example2\"), format=\"parquet\", unify_schemas = TRUE)\r\n\r\n# This does\r\nds <- open_dataset(c(\"example2/part-0.parquet\", \"example1/part-0.parquet\"), format=\"parquet\", unify_schemas = TRUE)\r\n```",
