Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `DeltaByteArrayEncoder` has a memory leak due to a bug in how `EstimatedDataEncodedSize` is calculated. DeltaByteArrayEncoder extends `encoder` which calculates EstimatedDataEncodedSize by calling `Len()` on its `PooledBufferWriter` sink. DeltaByteArrayEncoder however does not write data to sink, instead writing data to `prefixEncoder` and `suffixEncoder` causing EstimatedDataEncodedSize to always return zero.\u00a0",
