Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen attempting to verify RC2 on an Amazon Linux 2 image I was unable to build the example because of the following error...\r\n\r\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/7/../../../../lib64/libarrow.so: undefined reference to `LZ4F_resetDecompressionContext'\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it seems we depend on LZ4 >= 1.8 which is not available by default in Amazon Linux 2 repositories (although it is pretty easily installed and does not seem to introduce any nested dependency issues).\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
