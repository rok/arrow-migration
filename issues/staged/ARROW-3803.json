Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur main C++/Python job is bumping up against the 50 minute limit lately, so it is time to do a little bit of reorganization\r\n\r\nI suggest that we do this:\r\n\r\n- Build and test all C++ code including Gandiva in a single job on Linux and macOS\n- Run Python unit tests (but not the C++ tests) on Linux and macOS in a separate job\n  \n  Code coverage will need to get uploaded in the Linux jobs for both of these, so a little bit of surgery is required",
