        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14649](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14649). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-14167 added support for factors in `{}coalesce(){`}, but the factors that are returned will not necessarily retain the factor levels like `coalesce()`\u00a0does when used on an R data frame.\r\n\r\nFor example, compare these, noticing the difference in the levels:\r\n```r\n\r\n# R data frame\r\ntibble(x = factor(c(\"a\", NA_character_)), y = factor(c(\"b\", \"c\"))) %>%\r\n  mutate(y = coalesce(x, y)) %>%\r\n  pull(y)\r\n#> [1] a c\r\n#> Levels: a b c\n```\r\n```r\n\r\n# Arrow Table\r\ntibble(x = factor(c(\"a\", NA_character_)), y = factor(c(\"b\", \"c\"))) %>%\r\n  Table$create() %>%\r\n  mutate(y = coalesce(x, y)) %>%\r\n  pull(y)\r\n#> [1] a c\r\n#> Levels: a c\n```\r\nSimilarly, ARROW-13358 and ARROW-14659 added support for factors in `if_else()` but the returned factors will not always retain the levels like `if_else()`\u00a0does when used on an R data frame.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it is practical to make Arrow return the factors with the unused levels included like R does. If so, we should do it.\r\n\r\nSee the tests in `test-dplyr-funcs-conditional.R` that refers to this Jira.",
