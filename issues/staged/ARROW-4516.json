        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4516](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4516). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI suspect that there's an error in this line of code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L926\r\n\r\nWhile validating schema in the initialisation of a `ParquetDataset`, we assume that if `_common_metadata` file does not exist, the schema should be inferred from the first piece of that dataset. The first piece, in my experience, could refer to a file named with an underscore, that does not necessarily have to contain the schema, and could be an empty file, e.g. `_tempfile`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\n/tmp/pq/\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 part1.parquet\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 _tempfile\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior is allowed by the parquet specification, and we should probably ignore such pieces.\r\n\r\nOn a cursory look, we could do either of the following.\r\n\r\n1. Choose the first piece with path that does not start with \"_\"\r\n2. Sort pieces by name, but put all the \"_\" pieces later while making the manifest. https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L729\r\n3. Silently exclude all the files starting with \"_\" here, but this will need to be tested: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/parquet.py#L770",
