Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome subprojects have begun checking in generated Flatbuffers files to source control. This presents a maintainability issue when there are additions or changes made to the .fbs sources. It would be useful to be able to automate the update of these files so it doesn't have to happen on a manual / case-by-case basis",

We can't build files until the next flatbuffers release due to a bug in the codegen of required fields, and the other already known bugs. There's an alternative flatbuf implementation being worked on at\u00a0<https://github.com/butte-rs/butte>, but I don't know what its timelines are. Perhaps until one of the 2 options is fine, we could continue manually generating the files?"

I had to make manual changes because the flatbuffers crate hasn't been updated with some changes.\r\n\r\nI'll update the checked-in files when I look at the IPC changes that we haven't worked on in Rust"
