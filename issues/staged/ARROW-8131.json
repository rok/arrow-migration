        "title": "[Python] Add dynamic attributes to PyArrow ExtensionArray",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8131](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8131). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the present implementation, the interface of the class `ExtensionArray` is not extendable by user. One can not easily inherit from it, as the constructor __init__ can not be called directly, or it does not allow adding dynamically atttributes.\r\n\r\nKeeping the current design with build methods `from_\\*`, I believe it could then make sense to allow dynamic attributes in `ExtensionArray` (see\u00a0<https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html#dynamic-attributes>). The runtime & size cost of the Python objects would be fairly minimal, compared to increased flexibility it would allow.\r\n\r\nA typical use case where it could be useful would be dynamic mixins (added by custom Factory), allowing projects based on PyArrow to extend\u00a0(! :)) the interface with specific business logic.\u00a0",

But as `[~kszucs]` noted on the PR, seeing some actual code how you would use the dynamic attribute might help on thinking about the best solution."

Let me see if I can make it working the way you suggested."
