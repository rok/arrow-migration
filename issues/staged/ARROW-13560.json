Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when calling `Scanner$create()` on an `arrow_dplyr_query` the `projection` and `filter` arguments are ignored silently (since the dplyr query filters should be applied). \r\n\r\nThis is helpful for predicate pushdowns \r\n\r\nOne proposal is at https://gist.github.com/hannesmuehleisen/61d655bb345e0af374d10ca303894eef",
