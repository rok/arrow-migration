(so that column is much larger than 2GB of strings, chunking issue)\r\n\r\nlooks similar as\u00a0\u00a0https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2227?focusedCommentId=16379574&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16379574\u00a0\r\n\r\nCode\r\n \\* basket_plateau= pq.read_table(\"basket_plateau.parquet\")\r\n \\* basket_plateau = pd.read_parquet(\"basket_plateau.parquet\")\r\n\r\nError produced\r\n \\* ArrowIOError: Arrow error: Capacity error: BinaryArray cannot contain more than 2147483646 bytes, have 2147483655\r\n\r\nDataset\r\n \\* Pandas dataframe (pandas=0.23.1=py36h637b7d7_0)\r\n \\* 2.7 billion record, 4 columns ( int64/object/datetime64/float64)\r\n \\* aprox 90GB in memory\r\n \\* example of object col: \"Fresh Vegetables\", \"Alcohol Beers\", ...
