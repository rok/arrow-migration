        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8532](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8532). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome systems still use sentinel values to store nulls. It would be good if read_csv would place sentinel values and user wouldn't need to convet null bitmaps to sentinel values.\r\n\r\nAdding this support doesn't contradict Arrow specification as null values are undefined. Also it wouldn't add any overhead to read_csv. Since Arrow is general purpose framework I think we can relieve users from pain of converting bitmats to sentinel values.",
