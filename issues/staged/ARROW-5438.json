Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently do not write EOS at the end of a Message stream inside the File format. \u00a0As a result, the file cannot be parsed sequentially. \u00a0This change prepares for other implementations or future reference\u00a0features\u00a0that parse a File sequentially... i.e. without access to seek().",
