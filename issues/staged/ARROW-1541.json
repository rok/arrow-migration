Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Arrow GPU/CUDA build has a race condition with the generated Flatbuffers files. We must add a dependency so that the Flatbuffers files are compiled before the relevant arrow_gpu units are compiled.\n\nEncountered this when testing 0.7.0 RC0. Because arrow_gpu is alpha I don't think this should block",
