Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAbseil claims to have a async-signal-safe spinlock class:\r\nhttps://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/internal/spinlock.h\r\n\r\nThis could be used to implement rudimentary mutual exclusion between a signal handler and regular code that sets up or tears down shared resources used by the handler.\r\n\r\nThe caveat is that signals need (apparently) to be blocked inside the handler before taking the spinlock.",
