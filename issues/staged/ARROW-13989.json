Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis was added relatively recently. Many/most kernels use helpers like TemporalTypes() to define their type support, we should add the MonthDayNano type there and see what needs fixing (and add tests). We also need to update googletest testing::Types definitions to include the new type.",
