Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTravis-CI builds using llvm.org-originated binary packages have started failing:\r\n```Java\n\r\n[ 76%] Linking CXX executable ../../debug/gandiva-engine_llvm_test\r\n../../debug/libgandiva.so.14.0.0: undefined reference to `typeinfo for llvm::ErrorInfoBase'\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n```\r\n\r\nApparently this is because LLVM was compiled with RTTI turned off. See example report here:\r\nhttps://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/498\r\n",
