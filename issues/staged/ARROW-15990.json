Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nVS2022 has different paths than VS2019 (and VS2019 is not even available for download). And it's no longer necessary to install Boost separately, as far as I can tell? Also the AppVeyor bat seems to assume clcache we should make sure to document how to avoid setting that up.",
