Part of me wants to say that comparing against Protobuf is an apples-to-oranges comparison but it seems this is a common misconception. (We could perhaps compare both to someone sticking a `bytes arrow_record_batch` in Protobuf and sending that through gRPC and someone manually encoding data into Protobuf messages.)"
