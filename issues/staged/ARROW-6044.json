        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6044). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm using the pyarrow HDFS client in a long running (forever) app that makes connections to HDFS as external requests come in and destroys the connection as soon as the request is handled. This happens a large amount of times on separate threads and everything works great.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, after the app idles for a while (perhaps hours) and no HDFS connections are made during this time, when the next connection is attempted, the API\u00a0hdfs.connect(...) just hangs. No exceptions are thrown.\r\n\r\nCode snippet on what i'm doing to instantiate each connection:\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nhdfs = pyarrow.hdfs.connect(self.hdfs_authority, self.hdfs_port, user=self.hdfs_user)\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n\r\n//Do something\r\n\r\nfinally:\r\n\r\nhdfs.close\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny help on what might be causing these hangs is appreciated\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

It's possible that there is some resource leak, but I'm not sure where it would be. Maybe you can ask the Apache Hadoop community?"
