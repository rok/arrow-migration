Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFrom https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14116\r\n\r\nCreating a MapArray from a python sequence currently requires lists of tuples as values:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\narr = pa.array([[('a', 1), ('b', 2)], [('c', 3)]], pa.map_(pa.string(), pa.int64()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile I think it makes sense that the following could also work (using dicts instead):\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\narr = pa.array([{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'c': 3}], pa.map_(pa.string(), pa.int64()))\r\n```",
