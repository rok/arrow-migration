        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10321](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10321). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOn https://github.com/autobrew/homebrew-core/pull/31, where we are packaging Arrow for an old macOS SDK version, we found what I believe are 2 different problems:\r\n\r\n1. The check for AVX512 support was returning true when in fact the compiler did not support it\r\n2. Even when we manually set the runtime SIMD level to less-than-AVX512, it was still trying to compile one of the AVX512 files, which failed. I added a patch that made that file conditional, but there's probably a proper cmake way to tell it not to compile that file at all\r\n\r\ncc `[~yibo]` `[~apitrou]`",

Currently we are simply using check_cxx_compiler_flag for the simd detection, it could be more accurate to use\u00a0check_cxx_source_compiles to perform a try-build on a example SIMD code."
