Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA highly selective filter could emit tiny batches.  Running with tiny batches we have a lot of overhead.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, merging batches together requires allocation and copies so it comes with overhead of its own.\r\n\r\nWhen things are more stable we should investigate whether there is some threshold where we merge batches together after a filter.",
