Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```python\n\r\n>>> pa.union([pa.field('x', pa.int16())], 'sparse')\r\nUnionType(union[dense]<x: int16=0>)\r\n>>> pa.union([pa.field('x', pa.int16())], 'dense')\r\nUnionType(union[dense]<x: int16=0>)\r\n>>> pa.union([pa.field('x', pa.int16())], 42)\r\nUnionType(union[dense]<x: int16=0>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would suggest allowing \"sparse\" and \"dense\" strings as aliases to the internal enum values, and disallowing everything else.",
