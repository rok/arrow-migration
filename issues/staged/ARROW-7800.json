        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7800](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7800). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe GetRecordBatchReader API is really useful for streaming ParquetFiles with lots of RLE.\r\n\r\nI propose exposing this API in PyArrow in the following manner:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nfile_ = ParquetFile('file/path.parquet')\r\n\r\nfor batch in file_.get_batches(batch_size=100):\r\n     pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n(If anyone has any better ideas hit me up, I'm not 100% sold on exposing it this way.)",
