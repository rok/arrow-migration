I wonder if we want to put it somewhere more visible. There could be a CreateEmptyRecordBatch and CreateEmptyTable too. Can be done in a follow-up PR.\n> ![https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f440.png](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f440.png) \u00a01",
