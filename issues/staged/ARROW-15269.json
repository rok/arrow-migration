        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15269](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15269). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt has been noted by users that the [Compute Functions documentation (\"Invoking functions\" section) states that functions are invoked via CallFunction](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html#invoking-functions), but there exist functions (specifically [\"Grouped aggregations\"\\|#grouped-aggregations-group-by]) that can't be invoked directly via `CallFunction`. This is a bit misleading, although this is stated in the description of \"Grouped aggregations\".\r\n\r\nGrouped aggregations are stateful functions and at the moment stateful functions are not invocable in such a way.\r\n\r\nWe should clarify in \"Invoking functions\" section that not all compute functions are directly invocable via `CallFunction`.",
