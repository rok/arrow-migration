Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe would like to add cryptographic hash function kernels to Acero (MD5, SHA1, etc.).\r\n\r\nAt this time, there are no particular cryptographic functions we want to start adding, but the only hash functions available seem to be variants or specializations of xxHash, which is not appropriate for cryptographic use cases.",
