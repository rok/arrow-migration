        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13237](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13237). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn some conditions AWS S3 seems to respond with a redirect, but Arrow seems to consider it an error instead of following the redirect.\r\n\r\nFor example see\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n    s3, bucket = fs.FileSystem.from_uri(\"s3://ursa-labs-taxi-data/?region=us-east-1\")\r\n    print(s3.get_file_info(fs.FileSelector(bucket+\"/2011\", recursive=True)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error that you get is\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n OSError: When listing objects under key '2011' in bucket 'ursa-labs-taxi-data': AWS Error [code 100]: Unable to parse ExceptionName: PermanentRedirect Message: The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should probably follow the `PermanentRedirect` instead of choking over it\r\n\r\nIT is also possible to reproduce it using\r\n```Java\n\r\n    from pyarrow import fs\r\n\r\n    s3 = fs.SubTreeFileSystem(\"ursa-labs-taxi-data\", fs.S3FileSystem())\r\n    print(s3.get_file_info(fs.FileSelector(\"2011\", recursive=True)))\r\n```\r\n",

One problem is that it will probably always query the us-east-1 region before redirecting, so 1) there is an added latency especially if on the wrong continent 2) perhaps this costs more API calls (I have no idea about the latter)."
