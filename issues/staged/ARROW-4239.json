Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis code segment: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/00-prepare.sh#L143-L167>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt was complaining about missing files, so something with the pattern is wrong on OSX:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/00-prepare.sh#L148>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditionally the problem can be twofold, depending on the outcome of the RC0. If it passes the VOTE, than We need to run the previous update script, similarly like `[~kou]` did after 0.11.0 release:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/222632c67464a2bdd4724161c5ae79abf72a8bf7#diff-2294062bc9761f012d9abea73fa86153\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
