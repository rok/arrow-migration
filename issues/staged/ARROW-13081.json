Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when comparing the values of two timestamp arrays, we ignore whether the types have a timezone set or not. For example:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>>> arr1 = pa.array([1], pa.timestamp(\"s\"))\r\n>>> arr2 = pa.array([1], pa.timestamp(\"s\", tz=\"UTC\"))\r\n>>> pc.equal(arr1, arr2)\r\n<pyarrow.lib.BooleanArray object at 0x7ff9ec897f40>\r\n[\r\n  true\r\n]\r\n>>> pc.greater(arr1, arr2)\r\n<pyarrow.lib.BooleanArray object at 0x7f3fbc09bd60>\r\n[\r\n  false\r\n]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile absence of a timezone for the tz-naive/local timestamp, we can't compare both values. So I think we should rather raise an error in this case. \r\n(comparing timestamps with timezones but with a different timezone should be fine, since it's comparing the underlying UTC value which will give the correct result)\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\n\r\nNote: this will probably depend on the outcome of the discussion on the mailing list about the interpretation of timezone-less timestamps: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8216e5de3efd2935e3907ad9bd20ce07e430952f84de69b36337e5eb%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E ",
