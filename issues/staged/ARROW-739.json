Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe following script fails non-deterministically (most of the time) on my machine.\n\nWith `make -j1` it seems to work (though I only tried a few times). With `make -j8` it fails most of the time (though I have seen it succeed).\n\n```none\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git\ncd arrow/cpp\ngit checkout 8f386374eca26d0eebe562beac52fc75459f352c\nmkdir release\ncd release\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=\"-g\" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-g\" -DARROW_BUILD_TESTS=OFF ..\nmake VERBOSE=1 -j8\ncd ../../..\n```\n\nThe output from both a successful run (arrow_build_make_j1.txt) and an unsuccessful run (arrow_build_make_j8.txt) are attached, but the error may be the following.\n\n```none\ninstall: mkdir /Users/rkn/Workspace/testingarrow/arrow/cpp/release/jemalloc_ep-prefix/src/jemalloc_ep/dist: File exists\nmake[3]: *** [install_include] Error 71\nmake[3]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....\n```",

It seems that race conditions with external projects are possible. I see:\n\n```Java\n  if (JEMALLOC_VENDORED)\n    add_dependencies(jemalloc_shared jemalloc_ep)\n    add_dependencies(jemalloc_static jemalloc_ep)\n  endif()\n```\n\nWhat happens if you remove the dependency for jemalloc_static?
