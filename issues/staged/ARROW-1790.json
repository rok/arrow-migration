Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis would embed data like\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nstruct Point {\r\n  double x;\r\n  double y;\r\n  double z;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the struct could be embedded in a `FixedSizeBinary` with width 24. This is similar to structured data types in NumPy and other libraries",
