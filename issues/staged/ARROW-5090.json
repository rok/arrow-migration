        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5090](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5090). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nLinking an application or bindings against the parquet shared lib (from homebrew) fails with:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  dlopen(/Users/travis/build/r-lib/arrow/arrow.Rcheck/arrow/libs/arrow.so, 6): Library not loaded: @rpath/libarrow.13.dylib\r\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/opt/apache-arrow/lib/libparquet.13.dylib\r\n  Reason: image not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndeed if we check the dylib dependencies there is an unresolved reference to _@rpath_ to libarrow.\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\notool -L /usr/local/opt/apache-arrow/lib/libparquet.13.dylib\r\n/usr/local/opt/apache-arrow/lib/libparquet.13.dylib:\r\n\t/usr/local/opt/apache-arrow/lib/libparquet.13.dylib (compatibility version 13.0.0, current version 13.0.0)\r\n\t@rpath/libarrow.13.dylib (compatibility version 13.0.0, current version 13.0.0)\r\n\t/usr/local/opt/boost/lib/libboost_regex-mt.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)\r\n\t/usr/local/opt/thrift/lib/libthrift-0.12.0.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)\r\n\t/usr/local/opt/protobuf/lib/libprotobuf.18.dylib (compatibility version 19.0.0, current version 19.1.0)\r\n\t/usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 400.9.4)\r\n\t/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1252.250.1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this mean ARROW_INSTALL_NAME_RPATH is not working?\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to set the rpath when linking. The R package [apparently hardcodes](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/src/Makevars.in#L21) this to be /usr/local/lib which is appropriate.\r\n",
