Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `pull()` returns an R vector, but it's the only dplyr verb other than `collect()` that returns an R data structure. And there's no other natural way to extract a ChunkedArray from the result of an arrow query.  ",

But because arrow has a meaningful in-memory vector structure (Array/ChunkedArray), it makes sense to use it; it's just not possible in the same way with a remote SQL database with dbplyr."

Curious for `[~npr]`'s thoughts and others'."
