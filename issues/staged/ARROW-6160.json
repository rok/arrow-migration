Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in `AbstractStructVector#getPrimitiveVectors`, only struct type child vectors will recursively get primitive vectors, other complex type like `ListVector`, `UnionVector`\u00a0was treated as primitive type and return directly.\r\n\r\nFor example,\u00a0Struct(List(Int), Struct(Int, Varchar))\u00a0`getPrimitiveVectors`\u00a0should return `[IntVector, IntVector, VarCharVector]` instead of [ListVector, IntVector, VarCharVector]",
