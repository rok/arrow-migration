Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, I am implementing an async interface for Ray. The implementation needs some kind of message polling methods like `get_next_notification`.\r\n Unfortunately, I find `get_next_notification` in `<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/_plasma.pyx>` blocking, which is an impediment to implementing async utilities. Also, it's hard to check the status of the socket (it could be closed or break up). So I suggest\u00a0export the notification socket so that there will be more flexibility.",
