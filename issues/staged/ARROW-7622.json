Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Tensor and SparseTensor parts of the format are currently marked experimental. This presumably means that they are still allowed to change (and indeed they did change one month ago, in ARROW-4225). \r\n\r\nI suggest we take the opportunity to mark some fields required in `Tensor.fbs` and `SparseTensor.fbs`, to make input validation more robust.\r\n\r\ncc `[~mrkn]`, `[~jacques]`  and `[~wesm]` for opinions.\r\n",

Since \"required\" in Flatbuffers does not appear to have forward compatibility implications (see e-mail thread about this), old versions of the software would not be affected even if the current version of the files had been released to production.
