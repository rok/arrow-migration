Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs part of ARROW-15271,\u00a0`map_batches()` was modified to return a `RecordBatchReader`, but the implementation collects all results as a list of record batches and then converts that to a reader. In theory, if we push the implementation down to C++, we should be able to make a proper streaming RBR.\r\n\r\nWe won't know the schema ahead of time. We could optionally accept it, which would allow the function to be lazy. Or we could eagerly evaluate just the first batch to determine the schema. ",
