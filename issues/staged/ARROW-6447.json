Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis has been a frustration for me that my builds wait for the jemalloc_ep build to complete before proceeding to compile any C++ files for libarrow. Since only memory_pool.cc depends on jemalloc_ep, there must be some way to create a dependency between that single C++ file and jemalloc_ep. I spent a few minutes Googling about it but did not come up with an easy answer",

Really jemalloc_ep should only be a dependency of compiling memory_pool.cc but I haven't figured out how to convince CMake to do that"
