        "title": "[Rust] Resolve Issues with `prettytable-rs` dependency",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8637](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8637). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`prettytable-rs` is a dependency of Arrow for creating a string for displaying record batches in a tabular form (see [pretty util](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/c546eef41e6ab20c4ca29a2d836987959843896f/rust/arrow/src/util/pretty.rs#L24-L25)) The crate, however, has some issues:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n1.) `prettytable-rs` has a dependency on the `term` crate. The `term` crate is under minimal maintenance, and it is advised to switch to another crate. This will probably pop up in an\u00a0[informational security advisory](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2018-0015) if it's decided one day to audit the crates.\r\n\r\n2.) The crate also has a dependency on `encode-unicode`. While not problematic in its own right, this crate implements some traits which can bring about confusing type inference issues. For example, after adding the `prettytable-rs` dependency in arrow, the following error occurred what attempting to compile the parquet crate:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`let seed_vec: Vec<u8> =`\r\n\r\n`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Standard.sample_iter(&mut rng).take(seed_len).collect();`\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`error[E0282]: type annotations needed`\r\n`\u00a0\u00a0 --> parquet/src/encodings/rle.rs:833:26`\r\n`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |`\r\n`833 | Standard.sample_iter(&mut rng).take(seed_len).collect();`\r\n`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 | ^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer type for `T``\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny user of the arrow crate would see a similar style of error.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are a few possible ways to resolve this:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n1.) Hopefully hear from the crate maintainer. There is a [PR open](https://github.com/phsym/prettytable-rs/pull/125) for the encode-unicode issue.\r\n\r\n2.) Find a different table-generating crate with less issues.\r\n\r\n3.) Fork and fix prettytable-rs.\r\n\r\n4.) ???\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",
