Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs a developer of database clients and backends, I would like to have a standard in place to communicate between the two while being able to leverage the data transfer features of Arrow Flight.\r\n\r\nThe Arrow Flight RPC specification allows for extensibility by using opaque payloads to perform \u201cActions\u201d, specify \u201cCommands\u201d and so on.\r\n\r\nI propose the addition of a Flight SQL extension consisting of predefined protobuf messages and workflows to enable features such as:\r\n \\* Discovering specific database capabilities from generic clients\r\n \\* Browsing catalogs.\r\n \\* Execution of different types of SQL commands.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation and a POC changelist will be sent to the mailing list in the coming days which describes protobuf messages and workflows enabling these features.",
