Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf a dictionary is attached to a schema, it\u00a0may need to be converted before IPC sending. When this is not the case (which is most likely in practice), there is no need to do the conversion and no need to create a new schema.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe solve the above problem by quickly determining if conversion is required, and if not, we\u00a0avoid creating a new schema and return the original one immediately.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
