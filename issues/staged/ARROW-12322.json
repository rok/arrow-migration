        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12322](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12322). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are more than two dozen data type functions in the arrow package, and they are named very generically, so they represent a large surface area for potential masking problems, which are likely to occur in user environments, not in our CI. If these masking errors do occur, they will probably give frustratingly unhelpful error messages. This happened to me with `rlang::string()`. The error was:\r\n> Error in is_integerish\\(x\\) : argument \"x\" is missing, with no default\r\nThis can be worked around with some non-standard eval magic.\r\n\r\nI implemented a working version of this in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9952>\u00a0but we removed it before merging that PR because there were questions about whether there was a better way to implement it.",
