Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRequires bumping our minimum Go version to 1.17, since we're keeping with the N-2 cycle of Go and go1.19 was released a few months ago, bumping to 1.17 is safe.\r\n\r\nThis then allows us to remove the custom backported version of cgo.Handle for the C Data interfaces and use `runtime/cgo`'s Handle",
