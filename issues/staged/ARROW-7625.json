        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7625](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7625). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems that the ArrowFileWriter being used by parquet-glib just uses the default writer properties (<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/c_glib/parquet-glib/arrow-file-writer.cpp#L184),> and does not offer the user the ability to override this. As a consumer of the GLib API in Ruby (red-parquet), I therefore have no way of compressing Parquet columns. Of course, I can compress the entire file by doing something like `t.save('...', format: 'parquet', compression: 'GZIP')`, but this is not compatible with most tools and isn't the correct way of compressing a Parquet file.",
