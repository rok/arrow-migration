        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8691](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8691). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nMinio is initialized in a googlebenchmark fixture, which means that every benchmark will start a new server and re-generate all the data. We should better control this so that we can at least share data within a benchmark run, since it's the same files between all benchmarks.",
