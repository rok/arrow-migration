Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, invoking python from C++ requires a lot of boilerplate. For example, see any class named `/\\w+Vtable/` which holds a bundle of function pointers and a single OwnedRef to a python object accessed by those functions. This is unnecessarily baroque for adding simple callbacks and we could instead have a general purpose utility similar to std::bind which can bring a python object into closure.",
