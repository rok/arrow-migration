Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the Substrait producer version is hard-coded.\u00a0 Once Substrait merges in <https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/pull/342> and we can reestablish ourselves on an official release then we should update the code that creates the version to use CMake variables as described in <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14415#discussion_r999614867>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to have a single source of truth for the Substrait version.",
