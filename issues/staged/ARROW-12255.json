        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12255). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Ballista scheduler breaks a query down into stages based on changes in partitioning int he plan, where each stage is broken down into tasks that can be executed concurrently.\r\n\r\nRather than trying to run all the partitions at once, Ballista executors process n concurrent tasks at a time and then request new tasks from the scheduler.\r\n\r\nThis approach would help DataFusion scale better and it would be ideal to use the same scheduler to scale across cores in DataFusion and across nodes in Ballista.",

We should aim at a single API that will allow users to start with a single node / embedded mode, and scale out the nodes as needed without changing anything codewise.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThat will be the biggest advantage over the Spark ecosystem which is horrible to start with, and the Pandas ecosystem which is horrible to scale."
