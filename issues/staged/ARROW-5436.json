Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the `parquet.read_table` function can be used both for reading a single file (interface to ParquetFile) as a directory (interface to ParquetDataset). \r\n\r\nParquetDataset has some extra keywords such as `filters` that would be nice to expose through `read_table` as well.\r\n\r\nOf course one can always use `ParquetDataset` if you need its power, but for pandas wrapping pyarrow it is easier to be able to pass through keywords just to `parquet.read_table` instead of calling either `read_table` or `ParquetDataset`.
