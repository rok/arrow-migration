Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSay we have multiple parquet files under the same folder (a.parquet, b.parquet, c.parquet). If I pass a list of file paths into either of the two statements below\r\n```java\n\r\nds = pq.ParquetDataset(fps, use_legacy_dataset=False)\r\nds = pyarrow.dataset(fps)\n```\r\nThen rows of the resulting table will have:\r\n\r\naaaa...bbbb...aaa...bbbb...aaa...ccc..bbb...cccc\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

At least with that patch it will ensure to always give the same order (and also not row groups of different files interleaved). \r\n"
