(although it's maybe not too bad, and can first see how it goes)\r\n\r\nI would propose to push the nightly docs in a subdirectory like \"/docs/dev/\" or \"/docs/version/dev\" (and we can later add the builds for released versions under \"docs/5.0/\" or \"docs/version/5.0\").\r\n\r\n>  though we'd need to have a version selector somewhere on the page.\r\n\r\nWe would certainly need that eventually (especially when keeping the docs for past released versions), and there are several other doc sites using the same sphinx theme that have this. But I don't think we necessarily need to fix that before tackling this issue (for the nightly dev docs, it's a single url that we can document that can be checked). \r\nI will open a separate JIRA for a version selector.\r\n"
