        "title": "[Python] Expose Builder classes",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1964](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1964). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHaving the builder classes available from Python would be very helpful. Currently a construction of an Arrow array always need to have a Python list or numpy array as intermediate. As  the builder in combination with jemalloc are very efficient in building up non-chunked memory, it would be nice to directly use them in certain cases.\r\n\r\nThe most useful builders are the [StringBuilder](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/5030e235047bdffabf6a900dd39b64eeeb96bdc8/cpp/src/arrow/builder.h#L714) and [DictionaryBuilder](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/5030e235047bdffabf6a900dd39b64eeeb96bdc8/cpp/src/arrow/builder.h#L872) as they provide functionality to create columns that are not easily constructed using NumPy methods in Python.\r\n\r\nThe basic approach would be to wrap the C++ classes in https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/includes/libarrow.pxd so that they can be used from Cython. Afterwards, we should start a new file `python/pyarrow/builder.pxi` where we have classes take typical Python objects like `str` and pass them on to the C++ classes. At the end, these classes should also return (Python accessible) `pyarrow.Array` instances.",
