Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs mentioned in ARROW-1163, we should have a blog post about Plasma, describing:\n\n- The motivation and design of Plasma\n- The API\n- Some code examples on how to interact with it\n- A longer example that shows the capabilities of Plasma. I'm thinking of a large multicore sort example in Python, any opinions?\n- A call for contribution and possible future directions\n\nIs there anything missing from this?",
