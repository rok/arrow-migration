However, Pandas 1.0 changed their support to hang off DataFrame.sparse, and leverages scipy sparse columns via a sparse dtype (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/sparse.html). It seems as though Pandas is maintaining support. \n\nThe problem isn\u2019t going away. One-hot encoded data (a common representation in machine learning) is very sparse and will continue to be commonly used for the foreseeable future. \n\nThere are 55,000 unique ICD 11 codes; one-hot encoding ICD codes leads to very wide and sparse tables. Lots of other examples too..."
