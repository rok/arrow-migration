Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRelated to ARROW-2006. There are various IPC-related options like allowing 64-bit lengths that might be better encapsulated in an options struct rather than littered around different public APIs",

Though better do it before 1.0.0."
