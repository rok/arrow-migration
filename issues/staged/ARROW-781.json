Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/e53357cd610f1bdca0cbbac001e417f329d54be1/cpp/src/arrow/python/numpy_convert.cc#L260, the reference count of the base object is not incremented. I wonder if it should be. I've been running into problems with the ray code if it is not increased.\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/c-api.array.html#c.PyArray_SetBaseObject\n\nhttps://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/1d3e6e4522a95faf954e775b23a2f907e66caf31/python/caffe/_caffe.cpp#L232\n\nhttps://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/c90d7c94fd2077d0beca48fa89a423da2b0bb663/numpy/core/src/multiarray/methods.c#L393\n\n\u2013 Philipp.\n",
