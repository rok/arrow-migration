        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15359](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15359). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have a mixture of `base::stop()` and `rlang::abort()` in the codebase. Should we make a deliberate choice to use one or the other? \r\nIf we decided to switch to `{}rlang{`}, we could:\r\n \\* change the codebase as we go along, switching from `base` functions (`{}stop(), warning(), message(){`} to their `rlang` equivalents `abort(), warn(), inform()`\r\n \\* make an addendum to `STYLE.md` on condition handling\r\n\r\nWe could cover additional aspects of condition handling such as the wording of messages - for example, by using key words such as **must** or {**}should{**}.\r\n\r\nPlease discuss direction and why. :)\r\n\r\nNote: the `arrow` R package already depends on `rlang` so any outcome will not result in additional dependencies.\r\n\r\nUpdate: given `[~paleolimbot]`'s suggestion of the `abort(glue))` pattern I think we should include in scope adding a dependency on and using `{}glue{`}.\u00a0",

I've found that using `rlang::abort()` with `glue::glue()` has made the error messages in the R package I maintain much better since it makes it easy to provide useful output. As you've pointed out, rlang is already a namespace dependency and so is glue (through vctrs). In addition to your proposed update, I think we should add that `abort(glue()` (without the `rlang::` or `glue::` should be the preferred way to signal an error if additional information is required (as opposed to `paste()`, `paste0()`, or `sprintf()`).\r\n\r\nA note that this is how errors are signalled everywhere in the tidyverse where those dependencies are allowed (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2)."
