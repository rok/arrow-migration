        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13681](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13681). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyarrow version: 5.0.0.\u00a0\r\nPython version: 3.7.9\r\n\r\nI came across this issue due to very unexpected behaviour from the \"explode\" function obtained here:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12099\r\n indices = pc.list_parent_indices(table[col_name])\r\n\r\nif table[column] in this example contains several chunks, the indices will look perfectly fine for that chunk, but erratic and unexpected results for second chunk.\r\n No warning or info was given either\r\n\r\nA workaround that solved the problem for me is:\r\n```java\n\r\n  indices = pc.list_parent_indices(table.combine_chunks()[col_name])\r\n```\r\nThe behaviour then changes dramatically.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming this isnt expected and should be fixed?",
