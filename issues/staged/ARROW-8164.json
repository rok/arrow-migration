        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8164](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8164). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be useful to allow some schema unification capability after discovery has completed. For example, if a FileSystemDataset is being wrapped into a UnionDataset with another and their schemas are unifiable then there is no reason we can't create the UnionDataset (rather than emitting an error because the schemas are not identical).\r\n\r\nI think this behavior will be most naturally expressed in C++ like so:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nvirtual Result<Dataset> Dataset::ReplaceSchema(std::shared_ptr<Schema> schema) const = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will raise an error if the provided schema is not unifiable with the current dataset schema.\r\n\r\nIf this needs to be extended to non trivial projections then this will probably warrant a separate class, `ProjectedDataset` or so. Definitely follow up material (if desired)",
