        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7965](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7965). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nProvide a more intuitive way to construct nested dataset:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n1. instead of using confusing factory function\n   dataset([\n        factory(\"s3://old-taxi-data\", format=\"parquet\"),\n        factory(\"local/path/to/new/data\", format=\"csv\")\n   ])\n   \n1. let the user to construct a new dataset directly from dataset objects\n   dataset([ \n       dataset(\"s3://old-taxi-data\", format=\"parquet\"),\n       dataset(\"local/path/to/new/data\", format=\"csv\")\n   ])\n   ```\n   \n   In the future we might want to introduce a new Dataset class which wraps functionality of both the dataset actory and the materialized dataset enabling optimizations over rediscovery of already materialized datasets.
