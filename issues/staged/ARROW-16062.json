        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16062](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16062). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the API declarations for `libarrow_python.so` are in `libarrow.pxd` together with the `libarrow.so` inclusions. It would probably make more sense to move them to a `libarrow_python.pxd` file.\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems some `nogil` declarations must be fixed for those APIs that actually take/return a `PyObject*`, or depend on Python C APIs.",
