Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current HashAggregate implementation iterates over the final hash map once for each grouping expression and once for each aggregate expression. This is inefficient and possibly dangerous depending on the ordering gaurantees made by the hash map implementation.",
