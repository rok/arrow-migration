Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are code modules (such as compute kernels) that only require ArrayData for doing computations, so pulling in all the code in array.h is not necessary. There are probably other code paths that might benefit from this also. ",
