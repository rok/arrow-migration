Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome examples were added in ARROW-15011 but we need to (at a minimum) go through all of the bindings and look for `arrow_not_supported` and other checks where there is an argument we don't support or don't handle exactly the same as in R.
