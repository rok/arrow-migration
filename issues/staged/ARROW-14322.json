Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs one of the core values of Arrow is to make data portable, it would be great to have a documentation section on how to connect across languages.\r\n\r\nConnecting through pipes, files or networking is fairly straightforward, but we don't document how to connect using shared memory or even how to connect using cross language communication through the C API.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have at least docs for how to do that across Python<>Java, Python<>R, Python<>C++",
