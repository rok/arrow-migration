Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe sorter should work for any type of vectors, with a time complexity of O(n\\*log( n )). \r\n\r\nSince it does not make any assumptions about the memory layout of the vector, its performance can be sub-optimal. So if another sorter is applicable (e.g.`FixedWidthInPlaceVectorSorter`), it should be used in preference. ",
