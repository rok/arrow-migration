        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9945](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9945). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExpression::Assume can abort if the two expressions are not valid against a single schema. This is not ideal since a schema is not always easily available. The method should be able to fail gracefully in the case of a best-effort simplification where validation against a schema is not desired.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8037#discussion_r475594117",
