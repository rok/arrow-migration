Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI noticed that Apache Arrow's NuGet package has some (mostly cosmetic) areas of improvement:\r\n \\* It targets .NET Standard 1.3 but not .NET Standard 2.0 [as recommended by Microsoft\\|[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/cross-platform-targeting#:~:text=%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%20DO%20include%20a%20netstandard2.0%20target%20if%20you%20require%20a%20netstandard1.x%20target.].]\r\n \\* Its dependencies can be removed when targeting .NET Core.\r\n \\* It uses a license file but it could use an SPDX license expression.\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR to fix all of them.",
