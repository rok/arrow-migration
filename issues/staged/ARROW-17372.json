Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen trying to build the [feast go lib](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/tree/master/go) on ppc64le it fails because parquet internal seems to miss even the basic (pure go implementations for ppc64le) files. Providing e.g. `bit_packing_ppc64le.go` & `unpack_bool_ppc64le.go` should solve this issue in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt can then be enhanced by implementing the correct vector & matrix intrinsics for the Power architecture (e.g. VSX or MMA) in a second step.\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\ngo build -mod=mod -buildmode=c-shared -tags cgo,ccalloc -o embedded_go.so .\r\ncmd had error: exit status 2 output:\r\ngithub.com/apache/arrow/go/v8/parquet/internal/utils\r\n/root/go/pkg/mod/github.com/apache/arrow/go/v8@v8.0.0/parquet/internal/utils/bit_reader.go:230:18: undefined: unpack32\r\n/root/go/pkg/mod/github.com/apache/arrow/go/v8@v8.0.0/parquet/internal/utils/bit_reader.go:274:3: undefined: BytesToBools\r\n/root/go/pkg/mod/github.com/apache/arrow/go/v8@v8.0.0/parquet/internal/utils/bit_reader.go:318:18: undefined: unpack32 \n```\r\nI tested this already locally (with success) and create an according PR.",
