Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrent version of errorprone interacts badly with Intellij, leading to erroneous (ironically ) reporting of an error for using \"non-standard ascii characters\".\r\n\r\nThis causes intermittent but frequent failures of arbitrary tests and is thus crazy-making.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee Errorprone issue <https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3092>",
