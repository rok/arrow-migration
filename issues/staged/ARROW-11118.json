Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the ORC reader does not has support for the ORC UNION type which led to the ORC writer to be under-tested for ORC DENSE_UNION and SPARSE_UNION types. To fix this problem union support in the ORC reader needs to be added, union support in the ORC writer needs to be added and tested.",
