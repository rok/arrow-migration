        "title": "[Python] non-nullable fields are converted to nullable in {{Table.from_pandas}}",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5169). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn version 0.13.0, the `Table.from_pandas` function modifies the input schema by making all non-nullable types nullable.\r\n\r\nThis can cause problems for example with this code:\r\n```Java\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(list(range(200)), columns=['numcol'])\r\nschema = pa.schema([\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pa.field('numcol', pa.int64(), nullable=False),\r\n])\r\nwriter = pq.ParquetWriter(io.BytesIO(), schema, version='2.0')\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pandas(df, schema=schema)\r\nwriter.write_table(table)\r\n```\r\nWhich fails due to the writer schema and the table schema being different.\r\n\r\nI believe the direct cause could be <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/table.pxi#L622> where nullable is set to True by default, resulting in the table schema being modified.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks for your valuable work on this library.\r\n\r\nGiacomo",
