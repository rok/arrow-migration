        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2939](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2939). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nHey folks, apologies if this isn't the right place to raise this.\u00a0 In poking around the web documentation (for pyarrow\u00a0specifically), it looks like the auto-generated API docs contain\u00a0commits\u00a0past the release of 0.9.0.\u00a0 For example:\r\n \\* <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Table.html#pyarrow.Table.column>\r\n \\* Contains differences merged here: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1923>\r\n \\* But latest pypi/conda versions of pyarrow are 0.9.0, which don't include that change.\r\n\r\nNot sure if the docs are auto-built off master somewhere, I couldn't find anything about building docs in the docs itself.\u00a0 I would guess that you may want some of the usage docs\u00a0to be published\u00a0in between releases if they're not about new functionality, but the API reference being out of date can be confusing.\u00a0 Is it possible to anchor\u00a0the API docs to the latest released version?\u00a0 Or even something like how Pandas has a whole bunch of old versions still available? (e.g. <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/>\u00a0vs. old versions like <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/>)",
