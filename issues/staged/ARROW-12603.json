In this case, it looks like it's already been fixed on the master branch (i.e. for 5.0.0) in ARROW-12500:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n> ds %>% select(target) %>% collect()\r\n# A tibble: 53,000 x 1\r\n   target             \r\n   <chr>              \r\n 1 1 wk ahead inc case\r\n 2 1 wk ahead inc case\r\n 3 1 wk ahead inc case\r\n 4 1 wk ahead inc case\r\n 5 1 wk ahead inc case\r\n 6 1 wk ahead inc case\r\n 7 1 wk ahead inc case\r\n 8 1 wk ahead inc case\r\n 9 2 wk ahead inc case\r\n10 2 wk ahead inc case\r\n# \u2026 with 52,990 more rows\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre you able to try the development release?"

However, for this to be included in 4.0.1, we'll have to backport the fix from the 5.0.0/master branch as it's tied up in other changes."
