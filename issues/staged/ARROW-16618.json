Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs reported in https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/13111 parsing a timestamp with %p  will fail on Windows. This is probably due to issues with vendored strptime on Windows locales.\r\nWe should explore which flags can be enabled and how. Strptime tests suite should be expanded https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/compute/kernels/scalar_string_test.cc#L1842-L1890.",
