        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-18214](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18214). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nArrow needs to represent datetime / timestamp values as character strings, e.g. when writing to CSV or when generating partitions on timestamp-valued column. When this occurs, Arrow generates a string such as:\r\n\"2022-11-01 21:12:46.771925+0000\"\r\nIn particular, this uses a space instead of a T between the date and time components.\u00a0 I believe either is permitted in [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5)\u00a0\r\n\r\n<q>5.6. NOTE: ISO 8601 defines date and time separated by \"T\". Applications using this syntax may choose, for the sake of readability, to specify a full-date and full-time separated by (say) a space character.</q>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut as RFC 3339 notes, this is not valid under ISO 8601.\u00a0 It would be preferable to stick to the stricter ISO 8601 convention.",
