Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe following fails:\r\n```java\n\r\nbucket <- s3_bucket(\"targets/aquatics\", endpoint_override=\"data.ecoforecast.org\")\r\nx <- open_dataset(bucket$path(\"aquatics-targets.csv.gz\"), format=\"csv\") \n```\r\nThis is surprising since pointing to an individual parquet file path is fine:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nbucket <- s3_bucket(\"scores/parquet/aquatics/2022\", endpoint_override=\"data.ecoforecast.org\")\r\nx <- open_dataset(bucket$path(\"aquatics-2022-05-18-climatology.parquet\")) \n```\r\nMaybe related to discussion in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15060 or maybe not?\u00a0 In this context I'm thinking only about read.\u00a0 The above examples use public buckets so should be reproducible with no credentials.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
