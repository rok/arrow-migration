The two that are bugging me are (1) it doesn't support the week_start argument, so any attempt to round to the nearest week will assume that the week starts on Thursday, and (2) I'm having some difficulties with how timezones are handled, and not sure if the problem is in my code or if the C++ round_temporal function needs something extra?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think it's at the point where I'd benefit from someone taking a look, in case I am doing something terribly wrong :)"
