Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have an issue with the\r\n\r\npyarrow.fs.HadoopFileSystem() that i did not encounter with the legacy version of pa.hdfs.connect()\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen i do:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`filesystem = pa.fs.HadoopFileSystem('my_host', port = port, kerb_ticket = path_to_my_ticket)`\r\n\r\nIt gives me:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOSError: HDFS connection failed\r\n\r\nBut if I use the legacy version with the same parameters:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n`filesystem = pa.hdfs.connect('my_host', port = port, kerb_ticket = path_to_my_ticket)`\r\n\r\nThen the connection establishes successfully.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if I run\r\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nfrom pyarrow import fs\r\nfilesystem = pa.hdfs.connect(host='my_host', port=0, kerb_ticket=path_to_my_ticket)\r\nfilesystem = fs.HadoopFileSystem('my_host',port = 0,kerb_ticket = path_to_my_ticket)\r\n\r\nI am able to get the non-legacy filesystem connection to work.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue? Is there something obvious i might be doing wrong?",
