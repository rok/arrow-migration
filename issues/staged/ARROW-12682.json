Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI recently migrated from airflow version 1.10.10 to 2.0.0. One thing I notice is that the user's session is not remember anymore by airflow webserver.\r\n\r\nThe authentication model I use is basic username and password. Airflow webserver (and scheduler) are deployed as pods in Kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\nAs a Kubernetes pod, it can be up and down, normally not a big issue for me as with version 1.10.10, my login session is still remembered and I don't need to re-log when a pod is restarted, however, with version 2.0.2, its forced me to login again everytime the pod is restarted.\r\n\r\nCould you please let me know is that an intended behaviour with airflow 2?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
