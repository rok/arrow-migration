        "title": "[Python] Improve ergonomics of new FileSystem API",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7584](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7584). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe [new Python FileSystem API ](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/_fs.pyx#L185) is nice but seems to be very verbose to use.\r\n\r\nThe documentation of the old FS API is [here](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/filesystems.html)\r\n\r\n## Here are some examples\r\n\r\n**Filesystem access:**\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nfs.ls()\r\nfs.mkdir()\r\nfs.rmdir()\r\n\r\nNow:\r\nfs.get_target_stats()\r\nfs.create_dir()\r\nfs.delete_dir()\r\n\r\nWhat is the advantage of having a longer method ? The short ones seem clear and are much easier to use. Seems like an easy change.  Also this is consistent with what is doing hdfs in the [fs api\\| https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/filesystems.html] and works naturally with a local filesystem.\r\n\r\n**File opening:**\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nwith fs.open(self, path, mode=u'rb', buffer_size=None)\r\n\r\nNow:\r\nfs.open_input_file()\r\nfs.open_input_stream()\r\nfs.open_output_stream()\r\n\r\nIt seems more natural to fit to Python standard open function which works for local file access as well. Not sure if this is possible to do easily as there is `_wrap_output_stream` method.\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\n\r\n- If the current Python API is still unused we could just rename the methods\n- We could keep everything as is and add some alias methods, it would make the FileSystem class a bit messy I think becasue there would be always 2 methods to do the work\n- Make everything compatible to FSSpec and reference the Spec, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7102, \n      I like the idea of a https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec repo. Some comments on the proposed solutions there:\n      Make a fsspec wrapper for pyarrow.fs => seems strange to me, it would be having to wrap again a FileSystem that is not good enough in yet another repo\n      Make a pyarrow.fs wrapper for fsspec => if the wrapper becomes the documented \"official\" pyarow FileSystem it is fine I think, otherwise I would be yet another wrapper on top of the pyarrow \"official\" fs\n  \n  \n  ## Tensorflow RFC on FileSystems\n  \n  Tensorflow is also doing some standardization work on their FileSystem:\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190506-filesystem-plugin-modular-tensorflow.md#python-considerations\n  \n  Not clear (to me) what they will do with Python file API though. it seems like they will also just wrap the C code back to [tf.Gfile](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/io/gfile/GFile)\n  \n  ## Other considerations on FS ergonomics\n  \n  In the long run I would also like to enhance the FileSystem API and add more methods that use the basic ones to provide new features for example:\n- introduce put and get on top of the streams that directly upload/download files\n- introduce [touch](https://github.com/dask/hdfs3/blob/master/hdfs3/core.py#L601) from dask/hdfs3\n- introduce [du](https://github.com/dask/hdfs3/blob/master/hdfs3/core.py#L252) from dask/hdfs3\n- check if selector works with globs or add https://github.com/dask/hdfs3/blob/master/hdfs3/core.py#L349\n- be able to write strings to the file streams (instead of only bytes, already implemented by https://github.com/dask/hdfs3/blob/master/hdfs3/utils.py#L96), it would permit to directly use some Python API's like json.dump\n  \n  ```Java\n  \n  with fs.open(path, \"wb\") as fd:\n    res = {\"a\": \"bc\"}\n    json.dump(res, fd)\n  ```\n  \n  instead of\n  \n  ```Java\n  \n  with fs.open(path, \"wb\") as fd:\n    res = {\"a\": \"bc\"}\n    fd.write(json.dumps(res))\n  ```\n  \n  or like currently (with old API, which required encore each time, untested with new one)\n  \n  ```Java\n  with fs.open(path, \"wb\") as fd:\n    res = {\"a\": \"bc\"}\n    fd.write(json.dumps(res).encode())\n  ```\n  \n- implementing [readline](https://github.com/dask/hdfs3/blob/master/hdfs3/core.py#L809), needed for:\n  \n   ```Java\n  \n  with hdfs.open(\"file\", 'wb') as outfile:\n    pickle.dump({\"a\": \"b\"}, outfile)\n  \n  with hdfs.open(\"file\", 'wb') as infile:\n    pickle.load(infile) \n  ```\n  \n- not clear how to make this also work when reading from files ",

Making it nicer to use is a respectable goal as well, but the primary goal might be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nAs for fsspec, the abstract filesystem API is so big that it doesn't seem very convenient to implement (e.g. do we have to support transactions?)."

I will have a look.\r\n\r\nIndeed if the FileSystem API is only intended for internal use then it doesn't make any sense to change it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately currently there is no project that has a clean generic FileSystem API for S3 and HDFS. The only viable concurrent is TensorFlow and I think it should not be Tensorflow's role to define a generic FileSystem API.\r\n\r\nI don't intend to create a generic FileSystem project on on my own. I would prefer to improve PyArrows FileSystem API to get it reusable by other projects. Reusable could even mean \"interactive mode\" and to replace the fs bash shell commands (i.e. hdfs dfs -ls) and only use Python. That's how we used dask/hdfs3 and it worked well. But unfortunately it is deprecated in favor of PyArrow and doesn't support viewfs.\r\n\r\n"

Instead I went for what has been suggested by `[~jorisvandenbossche]`: making a wrapper on top.\r\n\r\nI started working on it but in my own project as I think I can make faster iterations (for example this for readline/readlines/iterator https://github.com/criteo/cluster-pack/commit/e88c4995797bd42e66812539d1d13a9fac25e0f9)\r\n\r\nMy plan is now to make a reasonable wrapper with the old filesystem, then switch to the new one and repropose the wrapper back to arrow at some point.\r\nI the meantime I unassign myself from this ticket."
