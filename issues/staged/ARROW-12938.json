Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn some situations, we may want to forward stop requests to external runtimes, e.g. gRPC (see https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10318 ), without polling.\r\n\r\nIdeally, one may temporarily add a callback to a StopToken. This bears complications, especially in the case where the stop request comes from a signal handler.",
