Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt seems to be possible to create a \"non-nullable null field\". While this does not make any sense (so already a reason to disallow this I think), this can also lead to crashed in further operations, such as writing to parquet:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [18]: table = pa.table([pa.array([None, None], pa.null())], schema=pa.schema([pa.field('a', pa.null(), nullable=False)]))\r\n\r\nIn [19]: table\r\nOut[19]:\r\npyarrow.Table\r\na: null not null\r\n\r\nIn [20]: pq.write_table(table, \"test_null.parquet\")\r\nWARNING: Logging before InitGoogleLogging() is written to STDERR\r\nF1128 14:08:30.267439 27560 column_writer.cc:837]  Check failed: (nullptr) != (values)\r\n*** Check failure stack trace: ***\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n```",
