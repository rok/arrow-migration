Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/windows.html#building-using-visual-studio-msvc-solution-files> describes setting up the conda development environment but if VS is opened normally then it will not inherit those env vars, conda will not be activated, etc. So building will fail. The documentation should help new developers go from zero to debugging in VS",
