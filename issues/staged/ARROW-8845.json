They sort of pick 10kb of sample upfront to calculate compression and if the results are good then the whole batch is compressed. This seems to save de-compression effort on receiver side.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPlease take a look at\u00a0<https://blog.dask.org/2016/04/14/dask-distributed-optimizing-protocol#problem-3-unwanted-compression>\r\n\u00a0\r\nThought\u00a0this could be relevant to arrow batch transfers as well.\u00a0",

Such a heuristic (observing compression\r\nratios of stream messages) could be implemented at some point so that\r\ncompression could be toggled off mid-stream if it doesn't seem to be\r\nhelping.
