We have the variables `PARQUET_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` and\u00a0`ARROW_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` in the C++ builds of the respective artefacts. We currently don't use these variable to set the\u00a0`*_HOME` variables in the Python CMake build and thus `THRIFT_HOME` is empty."

With that set to off it works correctly."
