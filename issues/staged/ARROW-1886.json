Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee discussion in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1873\r\n\r\nWhen a user has a struct column, it may be more efficient to flatten the struct into multiple columns of the form `struct_name.field_name` for each field in the struct. Then when you call `to_pandas`, Python dictionaries do not have to be created, and the conversion will be much more efficient",
