Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI found a similar problem issue from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66902732/pip-install-pyarrow-failed-on-linux-ppc64le)\r\n\r\nI am using Python 3.7 and PIP 21.0 and linux ppc64le in a cloud instance-based. I tried to install PyArrow with conda-forge but has the similar errors stated\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n**Incompatible with system CUDA Driver 11.0.0**\r\n\r\n**ERROR: Failed building wheel for pyarrow Failed to build pyarrow ERROR: Could not build wheels for pyarrow which use PEP 517 and cannot be installed directly**\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI want to know does PyArrow supports linux ppc64le? Even the conda page said it does, but I tried to install different versions of PyArrow but keep getting the same error. Does that mean I need to reinstall or downgrade my CUDA driver?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny advice will be much appreciated!",
