Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen install pyarrow via poetry and executing same, a ModuleNotFoundError error can result.\r\n\r\nPyarrow has a dependency on pytz, but this dependency is not declared (the only dependency I see declared is numpy, see <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/47d55752172af99fce629f8fe6177df6b41af1d3/python/setup.py#L576)>\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if pyarrow could declare its dependencies in such a way that tools such as poetry could automatically ensure they were present.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

(and with which code snippet you get it) \r\nI would assume that pytz is only an optional dependency (i.e. only used when installed), which doesn't require it being added to setup.py install_requires. And if we accidentally depend on it unconditionally, that sounds as a bug."
