Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`parquet::record::Row.get_column_iter` returns an iterator of `(&String, &Field)` tuples. The documentation for `get_column_iter` shows an example of consuming and printing the tuple from the iterator. Beyond printing the first thing one might attempt is to match on `Field` to handle the various types differently, but as `Field` is not re-exported from the private API module it is inaccessible. \r\n\r\nThe solution may be as straight forward as adding `Field` to `mod.rs` for `parquet::record` and seemed sufficient in my local testing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
