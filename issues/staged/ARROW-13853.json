Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-12714 added the **str_to_title** kernel and a basic mapping, but we should add a test. Also the stringr function takes a \"locale\" argument which is not handled here; we should either pass it to Arrow C++ if it supports it (which I doubt) or error if a value is provided in R.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to **str_to_lower** and **str_to_upper** kernels.\r\n",
