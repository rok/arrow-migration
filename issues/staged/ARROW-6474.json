There is no way for the user to set the option in the pyarrow writer either, so they would have to downgrade pyarrow. I think this it's fair to say they need to stick with pyarrow 0.14.1, but an env variable would give them a way to use the latest release."

I suppose the environment variable solution is not so awful. \r\n\r\nI'll assign this issue to myself since we ought to have this functionality in Python before the 0.15.0 release"
