Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyarrow dataset function can't read from s3 using s3fs as the filesystem. Is  there a way we can add the support for read from s3 based on partitioned files ?\n\nI am trying to address the problem mentioned in the stackoverflow link :\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45082832/how-to-read-partitioned-parquet-files-from-s3-using-pyarrow-in-python",

Do you have any time to work on this? I believe the S3FileSystem needs to be wrapped in a shim class to expose the common filesystem API: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/filesystem.py\n\nPlease report issues or feature requests here instead of StackOverflow (for example, I have stopped watching SO many years ago).

I do have time, but  honestly not quite sure if my technical acumen is enough to solve these issues. within a reasonable time-frame.  \nGoing forward I will report features or issues instead of using the SO post. I was only aware that there was some gap between s3 & pyarrow, but didn't quite stumble open the open issues [ARROW-1119](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1119) & [ARROW-453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-453) that you have mentioned. \n\nNot quite sure if the existing open issues includes the s3fs implementation option currently.

I figure this will take more than a day of testing to be suitably hardened for production, so let's work together so we can have this working robustly in 0.6.0. As soon as it's working we can set up conda builds to make deployment and testing easier until the 0.6.0 release goes out (hopefully within 4-5 weeks after 0.5.0)."
