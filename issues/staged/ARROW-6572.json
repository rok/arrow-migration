Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5365 we found via a UBSAN issue that Parquet decoding of RLE-encoded dict-encoded Parquet data with nulls does not initialize the output data array for null entries. Since the output data array is generally a freshly-allocated memory buffer, this means it will contain uninitialized memory.",
