        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4212). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, to create a CUDA buffer from a Numba device array, you have to write:\r\n```python\n\r\ncuda.CudaBuffer.from_numba(device_arr.gpu_data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be easier if you could just write:\r\n```Java\n\r\ncuda.CudaBuffer.from_numba(device_arr)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(ideally, any object exposing the [CUDA Array Interface](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/cuda_array_interface.html) would work)",
