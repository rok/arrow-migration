Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently Decimal128 and Decimal256's fields are exclusively in littleendian order, which can yield surprising results when `reinterpret_cast`ing entries of a buffer to `Decimal128*` on a bigendian platform, see https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9554\r\n\r\nThese utility classes will be more useful if they are always usable from a buffer without swizzling.",
