Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nJSON support requires RapidJSON, a third-party dependency that might not always be available. Particularly for offline static builds (ARROW-12981), it would be nice to allow `ARROW_JSON=OFF`.\r\n\r\nHere's the [relevant section](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/64bef2ad8d9cd2fea122cfa079f8ca3fea8cdf5d/cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake#L290-L292) of `ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake`:\r\n```none\n\r\nif(ARROW_JSON)\r\n  set(ARROW_WITH_RAPIDJSON ON)\r\nendif()\r\n```\r\nAnd the [relevant section](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/64bef2ad8d9cd2fea122cfa079f8ca3fea8cdf5d/r/inst/build_arrow_static.sh#L62) of the `build_arrow_static.sh` script.\r\n\r\nAs Neal [mentioned](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11001#discussion_r696723923), there's more to do than just replacing `-DARROW_JSON=ON` with `-DARROW_JSON=$\\{ARROW_JSON:-ON`}. \"We'll have to conditionally build some of the bindings like we do with dataset and parquet, and we'll have to conditionally skip tests.\"",
