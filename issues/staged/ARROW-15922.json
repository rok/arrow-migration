Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-13168 enabled timezone support on Windows, but found there was an issue with the vendored datetime library that caused invalid UTF-8 character to be emitted from strftime in certain locales. We should re-enable that test once we are able to get a fix in the date library (or some other solution is found).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/issues/726",
