Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the amount of padding bytes written after the IPC metadata header depends on the current position of the `OutputStream` passed. So if the message begins on an unaligned (not multiple of 8) offset, then the content of the metadata will be different than if it did. This seems like a leaky abstraction \u2013 aligning the stream should probably be handled separately from writing the IPC protocol.",
