        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11902](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11902). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe\u00a0`Schema` IPC message allows `custom_metadata`. [See here:](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/69d436dff83ce33e43acf3e2402e72317fa82aa7/format/Schema.fbs#L401)\r\n\r\nIt would be great if one could specify similar `custom_metadata` for `Tensor` and `SparseTensor` messages. Currently if one wants to pass the \"context/metadata\" of a tensor, one has to find out-of-band solutions.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice, if this could be incorporated into the IPC flow. E.g. one might want to pass a timestamp associated with a tensor indicating when the data was obtained or geographical coordinates indicating the edges of a 2D tensor to locate the data geographically.",
