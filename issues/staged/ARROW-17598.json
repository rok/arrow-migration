Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen compiling Arrow with the following parameter:\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\n-DARROW_BUILD_BENCHMARKS_REFERENCE=\"ON\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get this error and other similar ones:\r\n\r\n```bash\n\r\ncpp/src/arrow/io/memory_benchmark.cc:244:26: error: use of undeclared identifier 'Read'; did you mean 'read'?\r\nusing ApplyFn = decltype(Read);\r\n```\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `memory_benchmark.cc` does not define the Read function, and others, if the SIMD level is NEON (`ARROW_HAVE_NEON` is true).",
