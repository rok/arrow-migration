        "title": "[R] Helper function for casting from float to duration via int64() ",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16253](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16253). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis logic is used in several places in `R/dplyr-funcs-datetime.R` and it would be great if we could separate it into a standalone helper function. The main purpose would be to indicate the float -> int64 -> duration casting chain is being used.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOriginally raised by `[~jonkeane]` \u00a0during a review for one of the lubridate bindings.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12757/#discussion_r852389088>\r\n> I've seen this line in a few PRs recently \u2014 this is to get around the fact that we do not have float durations, yeah? I wonder if we should put that into a helper function. Not so much to save lines of code, but to encapsulate that we have this one workaround that we're using in all of these places.\n> \n> Then if that workaround is not necessary (or if we find a better one) we can change it in one place. We don't need to do that here, but it would be good to make a Jira for that if we do want to.",

Not sure how many use cases we would have. I found only one that is straightforward (i.e. without too much refactoring) - <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3c3e68c194ca6ac07086ddc1bb44fe153970213e/r/R/dplyr-funcs-datetime.R#L425-L426.>\r\n\r\n`[~alenkaf]` \u00a0added `make_duration` as part of <https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12855>, which I think is the same as the scope of this ticket.\u00a0"
