Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nTypically with cmake we create a dedicated build directory.\r\n\r\n```\n\r\ncd cpp\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake .. -DARROW_ENGINE=ON\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to do an \"inline\" build:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\ncd cpp\r\ncmake . -DARROW_ENGINE=ON\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the latter case we end up with a compilation error because when we clone the substrait repo we clobber our substrait source files.",
