        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6892](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6892). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently we have code in the SQL query planner that wraps aggregate queries in a projection (if needed) to preserve the order of the final results. This is needed because the aggregate query execution always returns a result with grouping expressions first and then aggregate expressions.\r\n\r\nIt would be better (simpler, more readable code) to always wrap aggregates in projections and have an optimizer rule to remove redundant projections. There are likely other use cases where redundant projections might exist too.",

It is a cool task, though. A simple test is something along the lines of:\r\n```java\n\r\ndf = ctx.table(\"t\")?;\r\ndf = df.select(vec![col(\"a\")])?;\r\ndf = df.select(vec![col(\"a\"), col(\"b\") + 1])?;\r\n\r\nlet plan = df.to_logical_plan()\r\n// plan must contain a single projection\r\n```"
