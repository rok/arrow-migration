Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSo that using it is natural for R users. Internally handle all of the logic needed to map those onto csv_convert_options, csv_read_options, and csv_parse_options. And give a useful error message if a user requests a setting that readr supports but arrow does not.",

IMO the idea that we would want two R packages\u2013one that just wraps the C++ library for developers, and a separate one that provides an interface for\u00a0analysts to work with datasets\u2013is YAGNI. There's no reason we can't have the lower-level C++ API wrappers and the analyst-centric interface in the same package, and no value at this point to splitting them.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently there already is a lower-level `csv_table_reader`, and all the `read_csv_arrow()` function does is invoke it:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/R/csv.R#L179-L181>\r\n\r\nI'm proposing adding R-flavored substance to `read_csv_arrow()` (and documenting it). I'm not proposing removing or making private the classes and methods that invoke the C++ library, so a \"developer\" could choose to write something at that layer if it were useful.\u00a0"
