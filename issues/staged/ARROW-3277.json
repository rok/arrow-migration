        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3277](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3277). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe recent manylinxu1 timeouts bring up a bigger question which is centralizing the validation of packaging builds. We definitely want the project to be notified in a timely way when there is some problem with a packaging build \u2013 since manylinux1 can be run locally in Docker, it is easier to debug and need not necessarily be run on every commit",

I'd rather invest in speeding this up a bit again. We're currently again at <30min runtime with the recent changes by `[~kszucs]`, so I have the feeling we're fine for some time."
