Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe would use this for alignment with `readr::write_csv()`. There the `eol` argument controls the end of line character to use. Most commonly either \"\\n\" for Unix style newlines, or \"\\r\\n\" for Windows style newlines.",
