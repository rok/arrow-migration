Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSelect values where a boolean selection array is true. As a default, if any values in the selection are null, then values in the output array should be null. \r\n\r\nThe null behaviour does not need to be toggable, if the user wants to select nothing in the case of null, then it is necessary to call selection_array.fillna(false) first.",
