        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-3923](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3923). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile I was going through the JDBC Adapter source code, I noticed a Calendar was required to create the Arrow Schema (for any Timestamp fields), and also needed for converting a JDBC ResultSet to an ArrowVector (for Date, Time, and Timestamp fields).\r\n\r\nHowever, Arrow Timestamps do not require a time zone, and none of the JDBC getters for Date, Time, and Timestamp require a Calendar.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a change to make the Schema creator and ResultSet converter support null Calendars. If a Calendar is available, it will be used, and if not, it will not be used.\r\n\r\nThe existing SureFire plugin configuration uses a UTC calendar for the database, which is the default Calendar in the existing code.\u00a0 Likewise, no changes to the unit tests are required to provide adequate coverage for the change.",
