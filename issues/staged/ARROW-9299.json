Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is currently no way for a user to directly access the underlying ORC metadata of a given file. It seems the C++ functions and objects already existing and rather the plumbing is just missing the the cython/python and potentially a few c++ shims. Giving users the ability to retrieve the metadata without first reading the entire file could help numerous applications to increase their query performance by allowing them to intelligently determine which ORC stripes should be read. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThis would allow for something like\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa \r\norc_metadata = pa.orc.ORCFile(filename).metadata()\r\n```",

I think the easiest thing to do would be add a function in `orc/adaptor.cc` that did basically the same thing done here [1]. After that it would be exposed so that python could invoke it I believe? I'm no expert here but seems like that would do the trick.\r\n\r\n[1]\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/d542482bdc6bea8a449f000bdd74de8990c20015/cpp/src/arrow/adapters/orc/adapter.cc#L235-L242>"
