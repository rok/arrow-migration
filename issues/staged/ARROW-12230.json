Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should move the nightly conda builds for aarch64 to Azure Pipelines as they currently fail on drone due to the hard 1h timeout. On Azure Pipelines, they should work automatically thanks to conda-forge's cross-compilation setup. The necessary trick here is that the `.ci_support` files contain a `target_platform` line.",
