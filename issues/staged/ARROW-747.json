        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-747](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-747). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a potentially confusing warning from arrow/io on Linux:\n\n```Java\n-- Configuring done\nCMake Warning (dev) at cmake_modules/BuildUtils.cmake:98 (add_dependencies):\n  Policy CMP0046 is not set: Error on non-existent dependency in\n  add_dependencies.  Run \"cmake --help-policy CMP0046\" for policy details.\n  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.\n\n  The dependency target \"dl\" of target \"arrow_io_objlib\" does not exist.\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\n  src/arrow/io/CMakeLists.txt:85 (ADD_ARROW_LIB)\nThis warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.\n\n-- Generating done\n-- Build files have been written to: /home/wesm/code/arrow/cpp/test-build\n```\n\nI believe you may need to link to libdl on OS X",
