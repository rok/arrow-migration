Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was looking at test output on Linux in preparation for CRAN release and noticed that all tests were being skipped. We should have a way to run tests for code that only is in R and doesn't require linking to the C++ library,\u00a0not only to protect against possible criticism from CRAN but also to make it easier for community members in the future to contribute R patches even if they struggle to set up\u00a0a C++ environment.",
