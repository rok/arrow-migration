        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9667](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9667). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\n *** caught illegal operation ***\r\n  address 0x7f9a07216687, cause 'illegal operand'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen calling compute__CallFunction(\"is_null\") on an Int32Array. This happens to be in the first test of the test suite, so the specific action is probably not relevant: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/tests/testthat/test-Array.R#L49\r\n\r\nThis is happening on \r\n\r\ntest-r-rstudio-r-base-3.6-bionic\r\ntest-r-rstudio-r-base-3.6-opensuse15\r\n\r\nbut not on \r\n\r\ntest-r-linux-as-cran\r\ntest-r-rhub-ubuntu-gcc-release\r\ntest-r-rocker-r-base-latest\r\ntest-r-rstudio-r-base-3.6-centos6\r\ntest-r-rstudio-r-base-3.6-centos8\r\ntest-r-rstudio-r-base-3.6-opensuse42\r\n\r\nor the builds we do on every commit (centos7 and a different ubuntu bionic).\r\n\r\nbionic started failing on July 31, and opensuse15 started failing on August 1, so it's possible that there was a change to those containers upstream that caused the issue and not a code change of ours.,",
