Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the `to_numpy` method doesn't return an ndarray incase of dictionaryd type data:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nIn [54]: a = pa.array(pd.Categorical([\"a\", \"b\", \"a\"]))                                                                                                                                                             \r\n\r\nIn [55]: a                                                                                                                                                                                                         \r\nOut[55]: \r\n<pyarrow.lib.DictionaryArray object at 0x7f5c63d98f28>\r\n\r\n-- dictionary:\r\n  [\r\n    \"a\",\r\n    \"b\"\r\n  ]\r\n-- indices:\r\n  [\r\n    0,\r\n    1,\r\n    0\r\n  ]\r\n\r\nIn [57]: a.to_numpy(zero_copy_only=False)                                                                                                                                                                          \r\nOut[57]: \r\n{'indices': array([0, 1, 0], dtype=int8),\r\n 'dictionary': array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object),\r\n 'ordered': False}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is actually just an internal representation that is passed from C++ to Python so on the Python side a `pd.Categorical` / `CategoricalBlock` can be constructed, but it's not something we should return as such to the user. Rather, I think we should return a decoded / dense numpy array (or at least error instead of returning this dict)\r\n\r\n(also, if the user wants those parts, they are already available from the dictionary array as `a.indices`, `a.dictionary` and `a.type.ordered`)",
