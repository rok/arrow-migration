Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-11174 adds support for arbitrary expressions in projection. It'd be useful to have that power when unifying disparate child datasets. For example, even the simple case where a column is renamed in a newer data file currently cannot be accommodated.",
