        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6736](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6736). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is a design flaw in the new aggregate expression traits and implementations where the input to the aggregate expression gets evaluated against the whole batch once for each row in the batch. For example, if the batch has 1024 rows then the expression gets evaluated 1024 times instead of once.",
