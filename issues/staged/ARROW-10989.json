Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIterating slices instead of indexes seems to improve performance of non-simd arithmetic operations.\r\n\r\nThis adds a new method raw_values_slice to PrimitiveArray (so named to pun off of the raw_values function which returns a pointer). A few of the functions in PrimitiveArray rely on the caller for safety guarantees (bounds-checks for value_slice, value), so should probably be unsafe? But they are used widely, so I thought it simpler to start by adding a safer alternative...",
