Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe mostly use `conda-forge`\u00a0as the developers of Arrow but also have some users that would build with packages from `defaults`. As the versions of packages is a bit behind (and sometimes the contents are different), we should also have a docker-test for this channel.",
