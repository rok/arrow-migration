        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10016](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10016). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, DataFusion has the logical operator `isNull` and `IsNotNull`, but that operator has no physical implementation. Consequently, this operator cannot be used.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this improvement is to add support to this operator on the physical plan.\r\n\r\nNote that these operators only care about the null bitmap, and thus should be implementable to all types supported by Arrow.\r\n\r\nBoth operators should probably return a non-null `BooleanArray`.",

Go crazy, and let me know if you need any help :)\r\n\r\nI am not working on tasks that I am not assigned to, by design. Feel free to assign yourself to it, so that others know.\r\n\r\nThis way, we can build a backlog of items that anyone can pick if they want to (which was the direction I was trying to head with the comment on github about placing the `array_size` and others as issues here).\u00a0:)"
