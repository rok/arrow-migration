        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13367](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13367). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the `is_null`\u00a0C++ kernel returns `false`\u00a0on `NaN`\u00a0values in floating point number data. Consider adding a boolean option to this\u00a0kernel that could be used to make it return `true` on `NaN`\u00a0values.\u00a0This would allow the code added in ARROW-12055 to be much simplified.",
