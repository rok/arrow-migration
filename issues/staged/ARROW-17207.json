There is no real upper bound on the number of scalar kernels we might add and I don't think most of our scalar tests run in parallel so we might get some performance benefit (probably just on many-core dev machines) from splitting.  I'll make a quick PR.\r\n\r\nI'll also check to see if any of them seem unreasonably slow."
