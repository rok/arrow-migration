Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/1285 for the initial issue. Having cyclic references is a valid state in Python as they can be cleaned up by the garbage collector. But as the garbage collector normally runs at a point which is not clear to the user and we deal here normally with larger objects, we should get rid of the cyclic reference to evict data as soon as possible from main memory.",
