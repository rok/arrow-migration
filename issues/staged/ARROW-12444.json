The rationale being that if integration runs always against master unintentional breakages to arrow can be introduced at seemingly random times, leading to frustration and harder to debug errors\r\n\r\nWith the specific pin approach we will have to increase the pin at some period of time, but we will have control over the schedule and will know exactly what versions were tested to be compatible"
