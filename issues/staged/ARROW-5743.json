Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have a number of unit tests that need to exercise code paths where memory in excess of 2-4GB is allocated. Some of these are marked as `DISABLED_*` in googletest which seems to be a recipe for bitrot.\r\n\r\nI propose instead to have a CMake option that sets a compiler definition to enable these tests at build time, so that they can be run regularly on machines that have adequate RAM (i.e. not public CI services)",
