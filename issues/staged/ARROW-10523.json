        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10523](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10523). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```java\n\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\narr = pa.array([pd.Timestamp(year=2020, month=1, day=1, nanosecond=999)])\r\nprint(arr)\r\nprint(arr.type) \n```\r\nThis gives:\r\n```\n\r\n[\r\n  2020-01-01 00:00:00.000000\r\n]\r\ntimestamp[us]\r\n```\r\nHowever, Pandas Timestamps have nanosecond precision, which would be nice to preserve in inference.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that TypeInferrer [hardcodes microseconds](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-2.0.0/cpp/src/arrow/python/inference.cc#L466) as it only knows about the standard library datetime, so I'm treating this as a feature request and not quite a bug. Of course, this can be worked around easily by specifying an explicit type.",

In the end, I explicitly wrote the data using unit=\"us\" and also added the coerce_timestamps=\"us\" write option."
