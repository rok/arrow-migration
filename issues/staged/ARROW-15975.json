Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-15952, we documented the `ArrayVisitor` and `TypeVisitor` classes. But as I discovered in [a cookbook PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow-cookbook/pull/166), you can't subclass these abstract visitors _and_ use type traits. Now I know why most visitor implementations within of Arrow don't subclasses these.\r\n\r\nWe should instead suggest users simply use the `VisitArrayInline` and `VisitTypeInline` with their visitors, and ignore the `ArrayVisitor` and `TypeVisitor` classes and associated `Accept()` methods. In fact, can we deprecate (or even remove) those? Do they add anything valuable?",
