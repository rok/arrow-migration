        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17283](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17283). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nhttps://github.com/google/snappy/pull/148 was finally merged, so if we upgrade to the current HEAD, we will resolve the UBSan issues we've observed and can remove some test skips (in R at least). And I see https://github.com/google/snappy/commit/8dd58a519f79f0742d4c68fbccb2aed2ddb651e8 as well, which may let us remove the `ARROW_SNAPPY_OLD_BUILD_VERSION` workaround too.\r\n\r\nWe could wait for an official snappy release, but they seem infrequent. Last one was over a year ago and there have been 2 sanitizer fixes we've upstreamed since then.",
