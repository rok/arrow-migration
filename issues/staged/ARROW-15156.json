Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n**Umbrella Ticket for the work related to implementing Tutorials for the Java docs**\r\n\r\nThe Java Documentation has a reference and it's getting an \"how to do\" part thanks to the cookbook, but it lacks a lot on the side of explaining how things work and what's available in the library. We should tweak the documentation adding tutorials for the most important capabilities of the library showing what's available and how it works.",
