        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15306](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15306). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBy default the S3FileSystem leaves the header alone, which is technically correct as I don't think a content-type should be specified if one isn't known.\r\n\r\nHowever, the aws-s3-sdk appears to set the content-type to application/xml whenever it is not specified: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/blob/5378016f845fe85e334ffc30319614e7d4dad41f/aws-cpp-sdk-s3/include/aws/s3/S3Request.h#L41\r\n\r\nWe could potentially file an issue with the S3 SDK but I'm not sure if that would make any progress (and S3 itself may require a content-type always be present for some reason).\r\n\r\nSince there is no way to avoid specifying a content-type then we should default to application/octet-stream which is a more accurate \"I don't know what this file is\" than \"application/xml\".\r\n\r\nThe content-type can confuse libraries that try and automatically act on the file based on the content-type.
