[generic-options](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/732e333c49555f696e5c1885629e2fafa8d0fd65/python/pyarrow/_flight.pyx#L1014) is a list of tuples that stores other generic Grpc connection arguments. To the list of generic options, add the following tuple ('grpc.ssl_target_name_override', server_name).\r\n\r\n**C++ Client** - Python client wraps the C++ client.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis ticket can be closed."
