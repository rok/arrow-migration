Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe don't currently even try to use the object name lintr because identifying the S3 methods isn't quite right for Arrow in lintr. The basics of this is that we should be able to do something like `head.ArrowClassName <- function()` but if the `head` bit isn't correctly identified as an S3 method, lintr will complain thinking we are mixing dots and camel case. There are a number of different ways this doesn't fully work (see below). Once those are resolved, we should be able [to enable an object name linter as well](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/a52050a8617a3d1164ea3e960b0a0260023d98bd/r/.lintr#L22)\r\n\r\nA few PRs + issues around this:\r\nhttps://github.com/jimhester/lintr/pull/843\r\nhttps://github.com/jimhester/lintr/pull/841\r\nhttps://github.com/jimhester/lintr/issues/842\r\nhttps://github.com/jimhester/lintr/issues/846",
