Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, the java library directly calls slf4j api, and there is no abstract layer. This leads to user need to install slf4j as a requirement even if we don't use slf4j at all.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is best if you can change the slf4j dependency scope to provided and log content only if slf4j jar file is provided at runtime.",
