Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe benchmarks build is failing on `macos-arm` from the [refactoring PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13311), see\r\n\r\n<https://buildkite.com/apache-arrow/arrow-bci-benchmark-on-test-mac-arm/builds/1389#0182d90f-8ef9-485e-abe8-fb32d3925c1f>\r\n\r\nI guess there is a env var missing in the `{}dev/conbench_envs/benchmarks.env{`}. I am struggling a bit to work with it locally so I will in the mean time make a draft PR and try it out on the buildkite with adding\r\n```java\n\r\nDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\nARROW_INSTALL_NAME_RPATH=OFF \n```",

Closing this here as it is not connected to the PyArrow build itself."
