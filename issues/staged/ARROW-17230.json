Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n- The return type of DeserializePlan is wrong: it should be `shared_ptr<ExecPlan>`, else we get a use-after-free.\n- Errors are ignored where they shouldn't be: you can get a half-constructed plan instead of an error.\n- A stateful callback is called twice, leading to invalid options being passed.",
