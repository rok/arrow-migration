        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17306](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17306). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAt the moment, `LocalFileSystem` does not have a separate optimized implementation of `GetFileInfoGenerator` with a fallback to the generic `FileSystem::GetFileInfoGenerator`, which simply queues the synchronous version of `GetFileInfo(FileSelector)` to the background thread and waits for its completion before yielding.\r\n\r\nThis generally defeats all the purpose of `GetFileInfoGenerator` so that we cannot really use it to push down the `FileInfo` items to whatever consumer \"on the fly\" (e.g. `FileSystemDatasetFactory` and `FileSystemDataset`, correspondingly).\r\n\r\nProvide a fair implementation so that it yields more than one time and allows to retrieve the data in chunks, so that the resulting `FileInfoGenerator` is usable for the purpose of streaming processing of data.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
