Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI got an error message \"ValueError: year 0 is out of range\" while using `pyarrow.jvm`. This error message doesn't really help me much as I have no idea which column caused the issue. It would very helpful if the error message can include source column name.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",

I agree it would be great to see the column name in the error message\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
