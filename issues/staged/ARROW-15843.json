        "title": "[FlightRPC][FlightSQL][Java] Make FlightSqlClientDemo a general purpose tool",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15843](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15843). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe FlightSqlClientDemo test program has a limited set of options that prevents it from being used against production databases. It does work against the Derby and SQLite examples though.\r\n\r\nThe major limitation is that there is no way to supply authentication information. The proposal here is to add support for passing in HTTP basic credentials and Authorization: Bearer headers.\r\n\r\nAnother useful feature would be an option to supply arbitrary headers (as a way of support server-specific options).\r\n\r\nLastly, it would be good to add an interactive mode that just ran the tool in a loop based on user input (and use ClientCookieMiddleware in this mode to persist state).\r\n\r\nA shaded configuration of the flight-sql module that set this tool's main function as the JAR entry point would make it more friendly to run as well.\r\n\r\nThis would make the tool comparable to SQLLine.",
