Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nReproducible as follows:\n\n```Java\nIn [3]: con = io.HdfsClient.connect(...)\n\nIn [4]: f = con.open(hdfs_file_path)\n\nIn [5]: con = None\n\nIn [6]: f = None\n```\n\nThe attempt to invoke `CloseFile` on the internal file handle in `f` causes the JVM to segfault. `f` should retain a reference to its parent `con` so this does not occur",
