In our CSV output we need to produce non-empty string for None values (mysql likes `{}\\N{`}). C++ definition for WriteOptions has `null_string` attribute which can be used to configure that, but that attribute is not exposed in pyarrow wrapper class. Same for `eol` attribute - it is also missing from pyarrow. Would be nice to add complete set of attributes to Python wrapper."
