Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSome of the java libraries used are very old - e.g. commons-cli dates from 2009.\n\nRather than (or as well as) reacting to security vulnerabilities when they are discovered, we should pro-actively update all our libraries to the latest versions.",

Accordingly (and in case that doesn't change in the next 24 hours), I moved this to 0.7.0, which should give enough time for downstream users to give feedback on the dependency upgrades"
