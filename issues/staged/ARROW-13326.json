Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe currently lint the cpp code under arrow/r, but not R linting. We could add [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) to Archery either at https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/archery/archery/utils/lint.py#L347-L351 or the shell script it calls: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/lint.sh\r\n\r\nThe first time we do this will be noisy and [styler](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) will help with that (and we could/should even include that in [autotune](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/f1ac15d38aa0df1fafd26ebf24638af789a1e1b5/.github/workflows/comment_bot.yml#L52-L132)",
