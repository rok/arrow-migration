Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhile converting from the parquet schema to arrow schema some errors, including those during flatbuffer decoding, can be lost. \r\n\r\nThis is due to get_arrow_schema_from_metadata returning `Option` rather than `Result`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8936/files# improved the situation by printing the error to stdout, so the error isn't entirely lost, but this message should be propagated up the call chain as a proper Rust error via a Result. \r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n            match arrow::ipc::root_as_message(slice) {\r\n                Ok(message) => message\r\n                    .header_as_schema()\r\n                    .map(arrow::ipc::convert::fb_to_schema),\r\n                Err(err) => {\r\n                    // The flatbuffers implementation returns an error on verification error.\r\n                    // TODO: return error to caller?\r\n                    eprintln!(\r\n                        \"Unable to get root as message stored in {}: {:?}\",\r\n                        super::ARROW_SCHEMA_META_KEY,\r\n                        err\r\n                    );\r\n                    None\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n```",
