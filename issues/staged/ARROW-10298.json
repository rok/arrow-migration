        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10298](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10298). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe NullableIterator used by DictionaryArray.keys calls ArrayData.is_null without taking the offset of that ArrayData into account. It would probably be better if ArrayData itself handled the offset in that method.\r\n\r\nThe iterator implementation could now also be replaced with the PrimitiveIter that was recently added",
