Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe documentation for connecting to hdfs from pyarrow shows using the `hdfs` executable for setting the CLASSPATH.\u00a0However in `_maybe_set_hadoop_classpath` the `hadoop` executable is being set. My understanding is that we will want `_maybe_set_hadoop_classpath` to set CLASSPATH to the `hdfs` executable as documented.",
