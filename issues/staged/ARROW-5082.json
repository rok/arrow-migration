Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe wheels more than tripled in size from 0.12.0 to 0.13.0. I think this is mostly because of LLVM but we should take a closer look to see if the size can be reduced",

I do not know how much this impacts the final wheel size. Until that issue is fixed at least, I'm not comfortable releasing the project again"
