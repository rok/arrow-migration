Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRecently the MinGW builds have been failing when trying to build LZ4. For some reason, CMake no longer finds the preinstalled version. (This I cannot replicate locally.) But while it should just fall back to building the local version, this fails because make is not installed.",
