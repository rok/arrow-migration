        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11854](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11854). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am have Windows 10 R 3.6.1 specific problem that I wanted to mention. Running:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n> arrow::packageVersion(\"arrow\")\r\n[1] '3.0.0'\r\n> arrow::write_parquet(iris, \"iris.parquet\")\r\nError: sink must be a \"OutputStream\"\r\nError in sink$close : object of type 'externalptr' is not subsettable\n```\r\nI've tracked this as far as \r\n```java\n\r\narrow:::io___FileOutputStream__Open(arrow:::clean_path_abs('iris.parquet'))\r\n[1]<pointer: 0X000000001510e210>\n```\r\nIf I try this on another Windows 10 machine with R 4.0.3 I get:\r\narrow:::io___FileOutputStream__Open(arrow:::clean_path_abs(\"iris.parquet\"))\u00a0 FileOutputStream\u00a0\r\nIf I try R 3.6.3 on Ubuntu (via RStudio cloud):\r\n```java\n\r\narrow:::io___FileOutputStream__Open(arrow:::clean_path_abs(\"iris.parquet\"))\u00a0 FileOutputStream\u00a0\n```\r\nThis definitely feels like an OS specific issue as io___FileOutputSteam__Open hasn't changed recently: <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blame/7184c3f46981dd52c3c521b2676796e82f17da77/r/src/arrowExports.cpp#L2161-L2165>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Like, you can read files, do dplyr stuff, etc.? The only change I can think of that might be relevant would probably mean that most everything is broken. \r\n\r\nFWIW CRAN says arrow passes checks on oldrel windows: https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_arrow.html"

Apologies for the bother. This was not on my local machine but rather a remote Windows virtual desktop infrastructure. Arrow was updated to 3.0.0 by the system admin while I was still logged into a machine. Your comment was a good prod. A logout/login on the same virtual machine fixed the problem. So no most everything is _not_ broken."
