Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBecause in the current ExecPlan, sorting is only done in the end (in a sink node), we can't sort the data and then do an operation that depends on sorting (like cumsum) without first calling compute(). (This is probably not yet a concern because don't seem to have any kernels that require order.)",
