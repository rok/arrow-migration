Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nA recent version of `AsofJoinNode` uses 64-bit hashing for by-key values. This [leads to a non-negligible probability of collisions](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13880) that are not arbitrated. Using 128-bit hashing, the probability will become negligible.",
