Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere are two places in DataFusion where the error message \"No files found\" is returned if no CSV files can be found in the specified directory with the specified file extension.\r\n\r\nIt would be much easier to debug issues if this error message stated the directory and file extension.",
