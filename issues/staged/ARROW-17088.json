Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRelated to ARROW-17072\r\n\r\nAs noted in the following document, the recommended extension for IPC files is now `.arrow`.\r\n\r\n> We recommend the \u201c.arrow\u201d extension for files created with this format.\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-file-format\r\n\r\nHowever, currently when writing a dataset with the `write_dataset` function, the default extension is `.feather` when `feather` is selected as the format, and `.ipc` when `ipc` is selected.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/f295da4cfdcf102d9ac2d16bbca6f8342fc3e6a8/r/R/dataset-write.R#L124-L126",
