        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-17958](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17958). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be desired to move the include paths for PyArrow C++ from `\"arrow/python/..\"`\u00a0to\u00a0`\"pyarrow/..\"` . That would be a bigger change in the PyArrow C++ API and would need a deprecation period.\r\n\r\nAlso, we might want to change the namespaces from `{}arrow{`}&`{}python{`}\u00a0to\u00a0`{}pyarrow{`}.",
