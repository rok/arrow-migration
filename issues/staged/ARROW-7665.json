Set `ARROW_R_DEV=TRUE` if you want more verbosity printed in the build. Set `DEBUG_DIR` to copy the cmake build directory somewhere not in tmp if there's a build error.\n- You can call `r/inst/build_arrow_static.sh` directly, like the [nightly builds do](https://github.com/ursa-labs/arrow-r-nightly/blob/master/linux/docker-compose.yml#L26)"

Clearly we want this to work as universally as possible, so if there are things that don't work, we should test them."
