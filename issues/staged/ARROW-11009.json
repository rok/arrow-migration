Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe routinely get reports like ARROW-11007 where there is suspicion of a memory leak (which may or may not be valid) \u2014 having an easy way (requiring no changes to application code) to toggle usage of the non-system memory allocator would help with determining whether the memory usage patterns are the result of the allocator being used.
