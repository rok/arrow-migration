        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1613](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1613). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, `ArrowReader.close()` will close resources (VectorSchemaRoot and Dictionary Vectors) and also close the input ReadChannel, or InputStream for ArrowStreamReader.  Closing of the ReadChannel should be done by what ever created it because it might need to be reused.\n\nIf this not possible, an alternative could be to add a method `ArrowReader.end()` that will close resources but not the ReadChannel.  Then `end()` could be called instead of `close()`.",
