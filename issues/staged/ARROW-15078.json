Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe get errors like\r\n```\n\r\nCMake Error in src/arrow/CMakeLists.txt:\r\n  Imported target \"opentelemetry-cpp::trace\" includes non-existent path\r\n\r\n    \"<path>/build/opentelemetry_ep-install/include\"\r\n\r\n  in its INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.  Possible reasons include:\r\n\r\n  * The path was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.\r\n\r\n  * An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.\r\n\r\n  * The installation package was faulty and references files it does not\r\n  provide.\r\n```\r\nWe need to create the include directory like other bundled builds do, e.g. see <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/dee4ba31773e3ba854e91f8b5df1423a0c88f352/cpp/cmake_modules/ThirdpartyToolchain.cmake#L3338-L3339>",
