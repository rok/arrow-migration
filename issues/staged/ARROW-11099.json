Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSplit out from ARROW-10990 which was the last internal user of that method. The same result can be achieved in a safer way by using `values()[offset..offset+len]`. The `raw_values` method in `BooleanArray` is also unused and could be removed.",
