        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-10791](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10791). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `read_dictionary` function takes both an ipc schema and a `Schema`, but it can get the information it needs from just the `Schema`. Then the `StreamReader` doesn't need to keep the ipc schema bytes around, because it also has the `Schema`.\r\n\r\nThe Flight integration test code needs to read dictionaries as well, and it seemed overly complex to need both kinds of schemas. PR coming!",
