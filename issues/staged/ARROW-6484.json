Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, when create `DictionaryEncoding`, we need to specify indexType, and it use Int(32, true)\u00a0as default if this value is null.\r\n\r\nActually, when dictionary valueCount is small, we should use Int(8,true)/Int(16,true)\u00a0instead to reduce memory allocation.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about to provide API for creating indexType according to valueCount and apply it to avro adapter for enum type.",
