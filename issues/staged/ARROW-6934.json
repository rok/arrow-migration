Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI was wondering whether there is a possibility to provide a different encoding for string columns in the parse option of the csv reader in pyarrow. I saw that there is a check whether or not a column is utf8 encoded. The default seems to be that if that turns out to be false the column is interpreted as binary.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to have a fallback option, meaning if the check_utf8 is false then maybe try latin-1 before turning to binary?",

Under the hood it's binary data just as in a binary column.\r\n\r\nSo you should be fine using a binary column."

Does that mean if I'd like to convert this let's say to pandas table using to_pandas() and have the column as a column of strings arrow would need to mark columns with other encodings than utf8?"
