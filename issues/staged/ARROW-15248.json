Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[Code Style, Linting, and CI](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/development.html#code-style-linting-and-ci) could use the following:\r\n \\* clang-format is implicitly described, but should be made an explicit requirement.\r\n \\* We should describe how to format C++ code with archery.\r\n \\* We should describe how to format/lint C++ code with the CMake build.\r\n \\* We should describe how Archery discovers the clang-format/cpplint executables.\r\n \\* We should describe how to use the GitHub Actions bot to try to format code.\r\n \\* If the wrong version of clang-format or clang-tidy is found, we should explicitly note that instead of just saying 'not found'\r\n \\* We should clarify that the exact version of these tools is needed\r\n \\* Link to the LLVM downloads since it may not be obvious where to get all these linter tools",
