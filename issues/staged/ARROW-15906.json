Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nS3 buckets typically have a lot of governance around them (permissions, cost-tracking tags), so they should not be created unless a user explicitly asks.\r\n\r\nWe should add an option to `S3Options` to control whether to create buckets, and default to False.\u00a0",
