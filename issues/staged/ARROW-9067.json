        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-9067](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9067). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt is possible to do branch-free index boundschecking in batches for better performance. \r\n\r\nI am implementing this as part of the Take/Filter optimization (so please wait until I have PRs up for this work), but these functions can be moved somewhere more general purpose and used in places where we are currently boundschecking inside inner loops.",
