Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently `ApproxEqualsVisitor`\u00a0will accept a epsilon for both float and double compare, and the difference calculation is always `Math.abs`(f1-f2)\r\n\r\nFor some cases like `Validator`\u00a0it is not very suitable as:\r\n\r\ni. it has different epsilon values for float/double\r\n\r\nii. it difference function is not Math.abs(f1-f2)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo resolve these, make this visitor accept both float/double epsilons and diff functions.",
