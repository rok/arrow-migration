Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGoogle has released a library of C++11-compliant extensions to the STL that may help make a lot of Arrow code simpler:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/\r\n\r\nThis code is not header-only and so would require some effort to add to the toolchain at the moment since it only supports the Bazel build system",
