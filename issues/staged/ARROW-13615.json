        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13615](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13615). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere is more to this issue than meets the eye. The `stringr::str_to_sentence()` does 2 things:\r\n \\* capitalise the first word \r\n \\* if there are multiple sentences provided as a single string, attempts to find sentence breaks and capitalise the first word of each sentence.\r\n\r\nThe `stringr` implementation wraps `stringi::str_trans_totitle()`, which in turns uses ICU\u2019s BreakIterator to locate specific text boundaries. As a consequence `stringr::str_to_title()` is not able to identify a full stop / period (\".\") as a sentence end and does not capitalise words following it. Thus, there is a discrepancy between behaviour of the `utf8_capitalize` kernel (which capitalises the first word of a string without making any attempt to break into sentences) and the behaviour of `stringr::str_to_sentence()`.\r\n\r\nFor more extensive discussions around the `stringi / stringr` implementation see `stringr`\u00a0issues [202](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr/issues/202) and [231](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr/issues/231).\r\n\r\nDue to the complexity of this issue and the relatively niche use cases, the recommendation is to postpone implementation.",
