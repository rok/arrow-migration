Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n```Java\n\r\n>>> pa.compute.sum(pa.array([], pa.int64()))\r\n<pyarrow.Int64Scalar: None>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd expect 0.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any reason for NULL, except that SQL returns NULL. But I can't figure out why SQL returns NULL. Does anybody know? Any textbook \u2013 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation \u2013 specifies 0.\r\n\r\nPandas and Numpy return 0. Also, Apache Arrow c_glib implementation returns 0 \u2013 and even tests for it: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/c_glib/test/test-int8-array.rb#L60\r\n\r\nWorkaround is to replace all NULLs with 0 after running the computation.",
