Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn FlightClient, authenticateBasicToken API call currently does not accept CallOptions. To mirror other API calls in FlightClient, these two authentication methods should take in CallOptions (optional) as well. A method overload can be created for authenticateBasicToken, similar to authenticateBasic and authenticate.",
