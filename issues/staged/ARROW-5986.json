Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn last few weeks, we did some refactor in dictionary encoding.\r\n\r\nSince the new designed hash table for `DictionaryEncoder`\u00a0and `hashCode`\u00a0& `equals`\u00a0API in `ValueVector`\u00a0already checked in, some classed are no use anymore like `DictionaryEncodingHashTable`, `BaseBinaryVector`\u00a0and related benchmarks & UT.\r\n\r\nFortunately, these changes are not made into version 0.14, which makes possible to remove them.",
