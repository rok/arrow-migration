Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSeveral Python classes introduced by https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5237 are unnecessary and can be removed in favor of simple functions which produce opaque pointers, including the PartitionScheme and Expression classes. These should be removed to reduce cognitive overhead of the Python datasets API and to loosen coupling between Python and C++.",
