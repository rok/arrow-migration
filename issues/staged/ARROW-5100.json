        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5100](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5100). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe collapse contiguous Uint8Arrays that share the same underlying ArrayBuffer and have overlapping byte ranges. This was done to maintain true zero-copy behavior when using certain node core streams that use a buffer pool internally, and could write chunks of the same logical Arrow Message at out-of-order byte offsets in the pool.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this can also lead to a bug where, in rare cases, buffers are swapped while writing Arrow Messages too. We could have a flag to indicate whether we think collapsing out-of-order same-buffer chunks is safe, but I'm not sure if we can always know that, so\u00a0I'd prefer\u00a0to take it out and incur the copy cost.",
