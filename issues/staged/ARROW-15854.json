        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15854](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15854). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCSV writer populates columns in reverse order, each row is constructed from last cell to first cell.\r\nPopulating columns in normal order makes the code easier to follow, and offers better optimization chances. E.g., EscapeReverse [1] is the hotspot for quoted string benchmark, it's hard to improve if chars are scanned in reverse order, but may benefit from simd if scanned in normal order.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/csv/writer.cc#L141-L150",
