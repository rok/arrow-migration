Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently, if arrow detects that every value in an int64 column can fit in a 32bit int, it will downcast the column an set the type to integer instead of integer64.\u00a0 Not having a mechanism to disable this optimization makes it tricky if you have many parallel processes (think HPC use case) performing the same calculation but potentially outputting different result values, some being >2^32 and others not.\u00a0 When you go to collect the resulting feather files from the parallel processes, the types across the files may not line up.\r\n\r\nFeature request is to provide an option to disable this demotion and maintain the source column type.",
