We implemented the dictionary->any type cast (\"unpacking\" the dictionary) in `AddCommonCasts`, but not the other way around. This would basically be doing a \"dictionary_encode\" (but being able to do that as a cast instead of having to call this kernel explicitly).\r\n\r\nThe current `cast_dictionary`  only covers dictionary -> dictionary casts."
