        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2579](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2579). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs far as I can tell it looks like appending to a streaming file format isn\u2019t currently supported, is that right?\r\n\r\nRecordBatchStreamWriter always writes the schema up front, and it doesn\u2019t look like a schema is expected mid file ( assuming im doing this append test correctly, this is the error I hit when I try to read back this file into python:\r\n\r\n\u00a0Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n\r\n\u00a0 File \"/home/ra7293/rba_arrow_mmap.py\", line 9, in <module>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 table = reader.read_all()\r\n\r\n\u00a0 File \"ipc.pxi\", line 302, in pyarrow.lib._RecordBatchReader.read_all\r\n\r\n\u00a0 File \"error.pxi\", line 79, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\n\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowIOError: Message not expected type: record batch, was: 1\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis reader script works fine if I write once / don\u2019t append.\r\n\r\nSeeing as IO interfaces support Append, streaming should support it as well ( if for whatever reason this cant be supported,\u00a0RecordBatchStreamWriter should throw if configured with an OutputStreamer that is attempting to append )",

At this time, it's not clear how to do appends from Python as FileOutputStream does not seem to be exposed by pyarrow.\r\n\r\n(A naive use of pyarrow's OSFile fails because it rejects the \"ab\" file mode, expecting either read or write, and a naive use of the cat utility results in only the most recent data being readable from the file.)"
