Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nComputing and uploading code coverage data probably makes Travis-CI builds even slower. Since the resulting data isn't currently exploited (and furthermore partial builds can upload bogus data, e.g. showing some C++ uncovered if only R is rebuilt), we should just disable it.",
