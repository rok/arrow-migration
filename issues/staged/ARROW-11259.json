        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11259](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11259). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in the Python layer we have `ds.field(name)` for referencing a field eg when creating a filter expression.\r\n\r\nOn the C++ side, the `FieldRef` has the ability to reference nested fields (eg a child of a struct), for example constructed with `FieldRef::FromDotPath`.\r\n\r\nWe should think about how to enable users to reference nested fields like this in the Python API.",

For example IpcReadOptions::included_fields is a set of indices of top level fields. So we'll need to add functionality to extract the top level field from a nested FieldRef"
