Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be useful to be able to set the size of data pages (within Parquet column chunks) from Python. The current default is set to 1MiB at https://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp/blob/0875e43010af485e1c0b506d77d7e0edc80c66cc/src/parquet/properties.h#L81. It might be useful in some situations to lower this for more granular access.\r\n\r\nWe should provide this value as a parameter to `pyarrow.parquet.write_table`.",
