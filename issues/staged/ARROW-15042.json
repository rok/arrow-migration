Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRecordBatch and Table have a bunch of similar methods that don't directly interact with the C++ pointer, and thus that could be shared in a common base class.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we also have some methods on Table that would also be useful for RecordBatch (eg `cast`, `group_by`, `drop`, `select`, `sort_by`, `rename_columns`), which could also be shared with a common mixin.",

Would that approach make sense?"
