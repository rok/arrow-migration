Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is the umbrella issue where we can collect everything related to parquet 2.6.0 support (parquet-format-rs: 2.6.1).\r\n\r\nIt looks like there's some plumbing needed on the typesystem + parsing logic to fully support writing and reading v2 of the file format.\r\n\r\nExisting compatibility issues can also be linked to this, or added as sub-tasks.",
