Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFor R, we vendor Boost and thus also include the symbols privately in our modules. While they are private, some things like virtual destructors can still interfere with other packages that vendor Boost. We should also namespace the vendored Boost as we do in the manylinux1 packaging: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/0f8bd747468dd28c909ef823bed77d8082a5b373/python/manylinux1/scripts/build_boost.sh#L28",
