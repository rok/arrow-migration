Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\npydata-sphinx-theme introduced automatic dark mode. However there is a series of changes we need to do (such as providing a dark-mode Arrow logo) before we will be ready for this (see ARROW-17152). For the 9.0.0 release, we should instead pin to the version of pydata-sphinx-theme just before that release.",
