Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt doesn't seem like we are publishing `arrow-c-data` in 6.0.0 release. It can't be found in Maven (see [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.arrow)).\r\n\r\nI think we should add it in `dev/release/post-11-java.sh`.",
