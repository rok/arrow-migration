Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have seen recently a lot of breakage with Pandas master. This is an annoyance to our users and should already break in our builds instead of their chains. There is no need to add another entry to matrix, just in one of them to re-run the tests with the Pandas master after they ran successfully.",
