        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15487). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should add an explicit Close() method to Flight clients. For backwards compatibility, the client destructor should call Close().\r\n\r\nFor gRPC, we do not have an explicit Close() method provided by gRPC, so it will just be a no-op (or perhaps explicitly drop the reference to the underlying gRPC client). When ARROW-15473 is implemented, Close() could cancel all calls and drop the reference.\r\n\r\nFor UCX, we will need an explicit Close() to clean up resources (and return error codes), so this will be useful then.",
