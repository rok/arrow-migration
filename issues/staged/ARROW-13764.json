        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13764](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13764). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI'm writing the R bindings for the grouped `count_distinct` kernel, but the current implementation counts nulls as their own group.  To match the R behaviour,  I need to be able to specify whether or not to remove NA/NULL values.\r\n\r\nPlease could we have ScalarAggregateOptions implemented for `count_distinct`?\r\n\r\n",

If this is about the groups, maybe this should actually be an option for the aggregation itself instead. If it's for the values, then it would be CountOptions."
