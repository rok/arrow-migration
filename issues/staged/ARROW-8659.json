Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBoth ListBuilder and FixedSizeListBuilder accept a values_builder as a constructor argument and then set the capacity of their internal builders based off the length of this values_builder. Unfortunately at construction time this values_builder is normally empty, and consequently programs spend an unnecessary amount of time reallocating memory.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis should be addressed by adding new constructor methods that allow specifying the desired capacity upfront.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
