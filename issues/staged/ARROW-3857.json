Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee performance issues with dynamic linking: https://www.macieira.org/blog/2012/01/sorry-state-of-dynamic-libraries-on-linux/\r\n(for example, CPython is significantly faster when compiled as a single executable rather than a shared library)\r\n\r\nWe might want to try enabling the `-Bsymbolic` or `-Bsymbolic-functions` linker flag. It might make performance slightly better.",

These flags are sadly not simple behaviour changes but also have other implications."

I was aware that there is some overhead associated with it but wasn't sure how much. Does it only affect exported / public APIs?"
