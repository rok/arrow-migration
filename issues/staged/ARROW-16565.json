Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nObtaining the IP address of the client can be [accomplished via gRPC](https://github.com/apache/arrow-cookbook/issues/196), but the gRPC interface exposing this information is considered unstable.\u00a0 It would be good to expose this through a standard interface in Flight, both to buffer any future changes/instability in gRPC, but also in support of alternative transports.",
