Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThese are string and binary types that use 64-bit offsets. Java will not need to implement these types for the time being, but they are needed when representing very large datasets in C++",

Should we do the same for large string / binary types, i.e. add a large list physical type?"
