I can't imagine why gRPC seems to only be sometimes setting them. And the schema size should be consistent.\r\n\r\nI think in the past, we've had the options struct be uninitialized causing odd behavior, but the test doesn't seem to make that mistake. I also don't see anything in gRPC suggesting that it adjusts the setting to a 'sane' range or anything like that. Maybe we can set the limit even lower. It would be nice to also set the gRPC log options, but they blow up log output significantly (6000 lines vs 200 lines).\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
