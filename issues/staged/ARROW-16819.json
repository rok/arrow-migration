Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is a design deficiency in `CallFunction`. If a function is nullary (zero input arguments), the execution machinery has no way to determine the output length from an empty vector of datums. We should add `CallFunction` variants based on `ExecBatch` and `ExecSpan` (from ARROW-16755) and figure out how to deal with the split between scalar (where inputs must all be the same length or scalar) and vector functions (whose input arguments can have different length)",
