        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13278](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13278). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n# Write some partitioned data to disk to read back in\r\nwrite_dataset(airquality, \"airquality_partitioned\", partitioning = c(\"Month\", \"Day\"))\r\n\r\n# Read data from folder\r\nair_data <- open_dataset(\"airquality_partitioned\", partitioning = c(\"Month\", \"Day\"))\r\n\r\n> air_data\r\nFileSystemDataset with 153 Parquet files\r\nOzone: int32\r\nSolar.R: int32\r\nWind: double\r\nTemp: int32\r\nMonth: string\r\nDay: string\n```\r\nMonth and Day are integers and there are no NA values in these columns of the data so, given the docs for open_dataset say that partitioning can be supplied as \"a character vector that defines the field names corresponding to those path segments (that is, you're providing the names that would correspond to a Schema but the types will be autodetected)\", this looks like it might be a bug somewhere.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
