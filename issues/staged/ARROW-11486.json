Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee https://github.com/apache/arrow-site/runs/1786669028?check_suite_focus=true for example. This started failing when the default ruby version increased from 2.7 to 3.0. Pinning the ruby version to 2.7 fixed it (https://github.com/apache/arrow-site/pull/92/commits/b1b8c4fc9138b28ede427967e37da70e12670969); maybe that's good enough?",
