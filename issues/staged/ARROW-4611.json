        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4611](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4611). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nInstead of the current approach we are taking with the `*_HOME` variables, we should use more CMake features and also give users of Arrow a more high-level control. This is going to be a rather lengthy issue with a lot of subtasks.\r\n \\* Let the user decide on the top-level how dependencies should be handled. At the moment I can think of\u00a0the following\u00a0modes:\r\n \\*\\* AUTO: Guess the packaging system we're running in, use this where possible, otherwise build the dependencies through the `ExternalProject` logic.\r\n \\*\\* BUNDLED: Don't use any dependencies, build them all through `ExternalProject`\r\n \\*\\* SYSTEM: Use CMake's `find_package` and `find_library` without any custom paths. If packages are on non-default locations, let the user indicate it from the outside using the `*_ROOT` variables.\r\n \\*\\* CONDA: Same as SYSTEM but set all `*_ROOT` variables to `ENV\\{CONDA_PREFIX\\`}.\r\n \\*\\* BREW: This uses SYSTEM but asks `brew` for some dependencies for their installation prefix.\r\n \\* prefer dynamic linkage where possible\r\n \\* Use `pkg-config` and `*Targets.cmake` files in projects that publish these\r\n \\* Ensure that the necessary integration tests are in place (Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine)\r\n \\* Integration tests that Arrow's `*Targets.cmake` and `arrow.pc` work.",

If there are no objections to this approach. I would like to go over all this and make a general cleanup. Currently we're just doing small cleanups but we're still facing a lot of issues with packagers so I'm happy to spent a bit more time to get the things cleaned up in general. I'll probably start first with some integration tests (read dockerfiles) so that I can ensure that I don't break existing installations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
