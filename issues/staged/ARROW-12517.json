        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12517](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12517). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThere isn't a convenient way to access the App Metadata from a Flight stream via the Go client, because the `ipc.Reader` returned from calling `flight.NewRecordReader()` only exposes the `array.Record` as you read data from it.  This should expose a Flight-specific reader so the client can also access the metadata, perhaps.\r\n\r\nModified `record_batch_reader.go` workaround/idea [here](https://gist.github.com/pgwhalen/ed768e18917610b2de7942144068f205).\r\n\r\n",
