Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe PR\u00a0 [1] merged for ARROW-7794 causes problems with projects that have a dependency on this crate where the build.rs code becomes an infinite loop looking for a parent directory named \"arrow\" that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply reverts that change. I will need to find a better approach to resolving the original issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0[1] https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6858",
