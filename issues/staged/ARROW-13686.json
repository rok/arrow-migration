Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n[Since pytest 3.0, fixture functions support the **yield** statement as a replacement for **yield_fixture**](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/yieldfixture.html). When pytest is run for PyArrow the following deprecation warning is shown:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nthe pyarrow/tests/test_serialization.py:283: PytestDeprecationWarning: @pytest.yield_fixture is deprecated. Use @pytest.fixture instead; they are the same.\r\n```",
