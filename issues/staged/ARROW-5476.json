        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5476](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5476). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe slice of netty arrow buf depends on arrow buf reader and writer indexes, but arrow buf is supposed to only track memory addr + length and there are places where the arrow buf indexes are not in sync with netty.\r\n\r\nSo slice should use the indexes in Netty Arrow Buf instead.",
