For example, instead of a self-pipe you would create an [Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/desktop/Sync/synchronization-functions#event-functions), and instead of using poll() you would [WaitForMultipleObjects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitformultipleobjects) on both the event and the file descriptor's underlying handle (obtained using [_get_osfhandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/get-osfhandle))."
