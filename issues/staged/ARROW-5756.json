Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe should decide when we want to stop producing manylinux1 packages. Installing manylinux2010 packages requires a recent pip (and, obviously, a not-too-antiquated system, but I think that's less of a problem for us).",
