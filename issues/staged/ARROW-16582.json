        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16582](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16582). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nPyArrow's dev page has a [build-and-test section](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/python.html#build-and-test) that currently does not list DATASET as a component. Using a recent Arrow version (commit e5e490), I observed DATASET was mandatory for the successful completion of the test suite ran by `<font color=\"#201f1e\">python -m pytest pyarrow/</font>`, as recommended on the page. Without `export PYARROW_WITH_DATASET=1`, I observed errors with `test_dataset.py`, `test_exec_plan.py`, and a couple others.\r\n\r\nSince DATASET is intended to be an optional component, it should be listed on this section. In addition, the documented test suite command should be updated to one that doesn't fail without the DATASET component being selected (or else the test suite itself should be fixed).",

It is possible that in the work for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16340 we decide to change the default flags for DATASET when building PyArrow.\r\n\r\nSee also discussion in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16526."

Could you share which version have you built and what are the test failures? As `[~alenkaf]` shared we did fix a test which failed if PYARROW_WITH_DATASET was not set but I have tested locally with current master without DATASET and I can't reproduce any failures."
