        "title": "[C++] Skip TestS3FSGeneric TestDeleteDir and TestDeleteDirContents on windows as they are flaky",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12610](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12610). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`TestS3FSGeneric.TestDeleteDir` and `TestS3FSGeneric.TestDeleteDirContents`\u00a0seem to frequently fail on windows. Probably due to a flaky behaviour of Minio or in generaly file system APIs under windows.\r\n\r\nSee\r\n \\* <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/38949620/job/u70y287m198p2kq6#L2267>\r\n \\* <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/38942788/job/tli5m3oklvb3c5b1#L2267>\r\n \\* <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/38935860/job/0kp6a625pu4a3420#L2267>\r\n \\* <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/38934402/job/j1qkeam34llk7tk3#L2263>\r\n \\* ...\r\n\r\nAs we already have in place a `have_flaky_directory_tree_deletion` flag to signal to skip some tests (or part of them) related to directory deletion under windows, it seems we could leverage the same strategy to skip those two tests too on Windows",
