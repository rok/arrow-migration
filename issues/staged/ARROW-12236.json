        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12236](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12236). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nOur (external) nightly R packaging and docs build is failing to render the pkgdown site: https://github.com/ursa-labs/arrow-r-nightly/runs/2266551062?check_suite_focus=true#step:9:55\r\n\r\nThis is due to (1) a [new-ish change in pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/pull/1395) that errors if topics are not included and (2) the recent addition of FragmentScanOptions, which did not get added to _pkgdown.yml.\r\n\r\nWe should validate this on our regular CI in order to prevent future issues like this. We often have to add things to _pkgdown.yml right at release time, and it would be better to keep up as we go. Some ideas for how:\r\n\r\n- Add a step to an existing R workflow (e.g. https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/.github/workflows/r.yml#L60) that does this check\n- Add a new workflow that is triggered only on changes to `r/man` and `r/_pkgdown.yml`\n- In either case, this could be done as a bash script, a python script, or an R script. If using R, note that the docker-based CI jobs won't have R installed, so you might want to tack it onto one of the windows jobs (which uses the setup-r action), but then you're in windows. \n- You could install pkgdown and try to build the site, but that's a lot of dependency to download and install just to essentially compare some lines in a yaml file with a directory listing (i.e., make sure that all `r/man/*.Rd` have corresponding entries in the reference part of the yml), so python or even a bash script might be more efficient to run. And since this is going to run a lot, it's worth considering how to keep runtime down even if that means more work to set it up.\n- If you're scripting this standalone, think you'll need to filter out Rd files that have `\\keyword{internal`} as pkgdown excludes those from the reference list.",
