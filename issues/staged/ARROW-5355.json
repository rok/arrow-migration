Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis is needed for Arrow GLib. In Arrow GLib, we need to determine how to wrap Arrow C++ `ArrayBuilder` at run-time. `ArrayBuilder` may be passed as a generic `ArrayBuilder` instead of concrete `DictionaryBuilder`. (e.g. `RecordBatchBuilder::GetField()`)\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4316#issuecomment-492995395",
