Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now, the function `to_duckdb()` doesn't check to confirm that DuckDB is available. The error message isn't the worst (it'll mention `duckdb::...` not being found) it would be nicer to specifically tell folks they need to install the duckdb package.",
