        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16388](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16388). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn ARROW-16325 we added a simple build to our crossbow that uses gcc 12 to confirm that building on it is ok. We did the quickest + easiest thing there, but the real solution is to send a PR to rhub that really mimics CRAN's behavior: CRAN runs GCC 12 in the debian-gcc-devel build only; the fedora devel build and debian release and patched are still using GCC 11: https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html. \r\n\r\nAnd then we should use that rhub image in our crossbow CI instead of using our bespoke install-gcc-version setup here.",
