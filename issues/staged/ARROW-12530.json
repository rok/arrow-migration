Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nProposed new implementation of mutable_data() by `[~apitrou]`\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n  uint8_t* mutable_data() {\r\n     return is_mutable() ? const_cast<uint8_t*>(data()) : nullptr;\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will help avoid various classes of bugs (initializing Buffer subclasses incorrectly) and make the object smaller on the heap",
