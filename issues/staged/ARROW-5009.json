Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis can also affect parquet.\r\n\r\nWe inconsistently use std::string, std::vector and std::shared_ptr, this will be an attempt to consistently use std::\\* instead of do \"use std::vector\".  This is more of suggestion, so if people are opposed to it (or some of the changes).  i'm OK not checking them in.  For now I plan on doing one pull request which will include parquet.",
