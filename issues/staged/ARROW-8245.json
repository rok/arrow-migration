        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-8245](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8245). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen writing a partitioned parquet file Spark can create a temporary hidden `.spark-staging`\u00a0directory within the parquet file. Because it is a directory and not a file, it is not skipped when trying to read the parquet file. Pyarrow currently only skips directories prefixed with `_`.",
