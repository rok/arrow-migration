Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe Netty community will declare Netty 4.0.x as EOL at the beginning of the second quarter of 2018: https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7439\r\n\r\nIt would be great that Arrow can migrate to Netty 4.1.x soon. This is the only blocker for Spark to migrate to Netty 4.1.x.",

It's possible they made some things private that could cause problems but I'm not aware of anything offhand.\r\n\r\nI probably can't get to it in the next week or two. If someone else wants to pick it up, switch the pom and the identify the issues I'd be to try to help give guidance on how to address any issues found."

When will 0.8.0 be released? Is it possible to release it early December so that I have enough time to upgrade Arrow for Spark. I noticed there are a lot of APIs changes and upgrading Arrow from 0.4.0 to 0.8.0 for Spark will be non-trivial. "

I would suggest preparing a PR upgrading Spark's use of Arrow in the meantime rather than waiting for 0.8.0 to be released. I think that `[~bryanc]` and `[~icexelloss]` will be able to help"

I have already started updating Spark for Arrow 0.8.0 and will submit a WIP PR under SPARK-22324 soon.  I'll ping you when it's up if that will help test out the Netty upgrade."
