Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nGuide to bundle LICENSE files with the wheels: https://wheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#including-license-files-in-the-generated-wheel-file\r\n\r\nWe also need to ensure, that all thirdparty dependencies' license are attached to it, especially because we're statically linking multiple 3rdparty dependencies, and for example uriparser is missing from the LICENSE file.\r\n\r\ncc `[~wesmckinn]`",
