Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWith ARROW-12203 the default parquet version was bumped for pyarrow to 2.4, at a minimum, we should add 2_4 as a valid version type to https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/9b0afc352e8b3ecb3104d58e4bcf09def256b587/r/R/parquet.R#L239-L242 and https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/9b0afc352e8b3ecb3104d58e4bcf09def256b587/r/R/enums.R#L122-L126\r\n\r\nBut do we also want to follow pyarrow's lead and bump up to a newer version by default?",
