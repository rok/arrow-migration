Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe idea is that a virtual table may reference Arrow data that is not yet available in memory. The implementation will define the semantics of how columns are loaded into memory. \n\nA virtual column interface will need to accompany this. For example:\n\n```Java\nstd::shared_ptr<VirtualTable> vtable = ...;\nstd::shared_ptr<VirtualColumn> vcolumn = vtable->column(i);\nstd::shared_ptr<Column> = vcolumn->Materialize();\nstd::shared_ptr<Table> = vtable->Materialize();\n```",

It may make sense to add a pure virtual method to `arrow::Table` which ensures that all data is loaded into memory. This will allow different Table implementations to define their own logic for materialization"
