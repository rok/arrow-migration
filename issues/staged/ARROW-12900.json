Happy to take advice on how to format this.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI am trying to copy and paste the example here\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/dataset.html#reading-datasets>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI notice there is an example of `np.random.randn(10)` but no `import numpy as np` in the lines above.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf trivial i'm inclined to make a PR here. I believe it's adding the line here\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/python/dataset.rst#reading-datasets",
