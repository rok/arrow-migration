        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4848](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4848). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen trying to link the R bindings against static libparquet.a + libarrow.a we get a lot of missing arrow symbol warnings from libparquet.a. I think the problem is that libparquet.a was not compiled -DARROW_STATIC, and therefore cannot be linked against libarrow.a.\r\n\r\nWhen arrow cmake is configured with  -DARROW_BUILD_SHARED=OFF I think it should automatically use -DARROW_STATIC when compiling libparquet on Windows?\r\n",
