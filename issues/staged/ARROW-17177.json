Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe current document is too-length. By creating sub-pages for each example and explain the code and provide a better description, that would be much better in terms of readability and browsing the content. The idea is to create a sub-folder in the examples called 'acero` and include each example in a separate `.cc` file. This is the code change. Following this, the documentation page on the website can be splitted into sub-pages. This is the only change suggested for this sub-task.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere is already a JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16802\u00a0to improve the internal content. So it would be used for re-writing the contnet.\u00a0",

But documentation is formatted and organized better. There is a separate effort to improve the content for each example. "
