Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nExecutionContext.create_logical_plan currently returns an optimized plan.\r\n\r\nThere is already a separate method on ExecutionContext for creating an optimized plan and it would be better to have create_logical_plan return the unoptimized plan. This helps with testing and also helps for my use case where I want to pass the logical plan to another node before it gets optimized (it is not currently possible to optimize a plan twice, and this is causing me some issues)",
