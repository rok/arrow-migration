        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15564). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `arrow::ConcatenateTables` function exposes the `Field::MergeOptions` as a way to indicate how fields with different types should be merged (\"unified\" / \"common type\").\r\n\r\nThe version to concatenate arrays (`arrow::Concatenate`) currently requires all same-typed arrays. We could add a MergeOptions option here as well?\r\n\r\n(this depends on ARROW-14705 to make this option more useful, currently it only handles null -> any upcasts, I think)",

ARROW-14705 currently uses an #ifdef but it would be nice to have ARROW-8891 supported."
