        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-7477](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7477). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen setting up the gRPC service, we mangle the gRPC [service descriptor](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/flight/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/flight/FlightBindingService.java), removing reflection information. This means things like gRPC reflection don't work, which is necessary for debugging/development tools like [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/). Reflection information is also useful to do things like authorization/access control based on RPC method.",
