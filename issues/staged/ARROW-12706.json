Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIf we are following\u00a0[NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)\u00a0we can safely drop python 3.6 (released in 2016) and numpy 1.16 support (released in 2019), they got unsupported in January by numpy.\r\n\r\nPython 3.6 will reach end of life in 6-7 months anyways, so it's a good target for removal in pyarrow 5.0.0 or 6.0.0.\u00a0",
