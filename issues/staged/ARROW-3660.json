Use case: process-1 append-only writer, process-2 reader that needs to remap once in a while.\u00a0I'd change the following:\r\n \\* Take a new optional flag (default=true) in the constructor that hints if the memory map is expected to be resizable, e.g. `resizable`.\r\n \\* Hide the lock/mutex condition in a private method, e.g. `GetResizeMutex()` and in this function, switch on this new property instead of `writable()`.\r\n\r\nThus if you want the performance optimisation by avoiding the contended mutex, you\u00a0construct with `resizable=false`."
