Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nS3Filesystem operations can fail with opaque curl errors that are hard to debug from R, as I could see no way of accessing what URL or header information was being sent even when we enter the R debugger.\u00a0 We are left with relatively opaque errors such as:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\nError: IOError: When resolving region for bucket 'analysis': AWS Error [code 99]: curlCode: 6, Couldn't resolve host name \n```\r\nwhich could have a whole host of underlying causes, from incorrect URL construction (e.g. incorrectly specified endpoint_override, default_region, etc) to other network issues https certificate failure or network connectivity problems. \r\n\r\nIn any event, a common source of this seems to be collisions with AWS credentials in environmental variables or elsewhere interfering with the intended credentials (which may be fine with 'default' values \u2013 e.g. like when accessing a MINIO bucket we do not need a \"region\" (actually it's not needed in AWS as it can be attained from the endpoint; or at least that is the argument given by MINIO).\r\n\r\nIn a recent case, I'd already made sure I didn't have any AWS_DEFAULT_REGION or AWS_S3_ENDPOINT env var set, but still kept getting this error on a MINIO bucket on one machine , but not others.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNeal pointed out to me the existence of `AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED`, and indeed, setting that to TRUE resolved the issue.\u00a0 Others may also be unaware of this option, it might be good to highlight in the S3Filesystem vignette and/or docs.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
