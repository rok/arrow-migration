Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRight now we can do `summarize(x = agg(field), y = agg(expr))` but we can't do `z = agg(fn\\(x\\))` or `q = agg(field) + agg(field)`. This will require more complex expression massaging.",
