Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be beneficial to know the exact bytes-on-wire savings once the message has been produced. Since this computation would be relatively trivial it would not add overhead to the IPC write hot path. ",
