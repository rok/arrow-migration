Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be nice to be able to serialize/deserialize Flight types (e.g. FlightInfo) to/from the binary representations, in order to interoperate with systems that might want to provide (say) Flight tickets or FlightInfo without using the Flight protocol. For instance, you might have a search server that exposes a REST interface and wants to provide FlightInfo objects for Flight clients, without having to listen on a separate port.",
