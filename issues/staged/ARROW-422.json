Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen we vendor RapidJSON, there is currently no dependency specified in the CMakeLists that the IPC sources are depending on RapidJSON. Thus `make` might try to compile the IPC sources before downloading RapidJSON and then will error.",
