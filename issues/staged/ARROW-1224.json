Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe recommend 64-byte padding in memory allocations, but in practice some systems may emit buffers that are only 8-byte aligned. We should take a look through the format documents and perhaps indicate that 64-byte padding is the _preferred_ padding but that 8-byte padding is the _required_ padding. \n\nIn particular, it should be clear that each buffer in an IPC payload must start on an aligned 8-byte offset, but it does not necessarily need to be 64-byte aligned.

So we can load the column values from the 64-byte buffer into the 512-bit wide SIMD register and run operations in parallel \u2013 higher degree of data-level parallelism\n\nHowever, it looks like the minimum/strict alignment requirement should be 16-byte boundary as far as SIMD processing is concerned since that allows us to use 128-bit wide SIMD registers added as part of Intel SSE instruction set.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nThanks,\nSidd"

In the event that you do not align: performance will be slightly worse."
