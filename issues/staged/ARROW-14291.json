        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14291](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14291). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs described in <https://dev.to/flipp-engineering/linting-only-changed-files-with-github-actions-4ddp> development efficiency can be improved if altered code is automatically linted by a CI action. Linting of examples in C++ is not done, and it is good to add this and update documentation on linting to make it easier for new developers to follow.",
