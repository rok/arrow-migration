        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4706](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4706). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCSV and JSON both convert strings to values in a Array but there is little code sharing beyond `arrow::util::StringConverter`.\r\n\r\nIt would be advantageous if a single interface could be shared between CSV and JSON to do the heavy lifting of conversion consistently. This would simplify addition of new parsers as well as allowing all parsers to immediately take advantage of a new conversion strategy.\r\n",

Obviously the parsing will be different, but even the conversion layer will be different too. So perhaps the higher-level orchestration layer can be shared.\r\n\r\nNote that ARROW-3410 will imply changing the CSV orchestration layer."
