Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nDue to bigger changes in the build workflow for Arrow C++ coming up in the 10.0.0 release, failures when building the libraries are quite common. The errors we bump into are similar to:\r\n```java\n\r\n    CMake Error at build/dist/lib/cmake/ArrowPython/ArrowPythonConfig.cmake:61 (arrow_keep_backward_compatibility):\r\n      Unknown CMake command \"arrow_keep_backward_compatibility\".\r\n    Call Stack (most recent call first):\r\n      CMakeLists.txt:240 (find_package)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```java\n\r\n-- Found Python3Alt: /Users/alenkafrim/repos/pyarrow-dev-9/bin/python  \r\nCMake Error at /opt/homebrew/Cellar/cmake/3.24.1/share/cmake/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:47 (find_package):\r\n  By not providing \"FindArrow.cmake\" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has\r\n  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by \"Arrow\", but\r\n  CMake did not find one.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Could not find a package configuration file provided by \"Arrow\" with any of\r\n  the following names:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ArrowConfig.cmake\r\n    arrow-config.cmake\r\n\r\n\r\n  Add the installation prefix of \"Arrow\" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set\r\n  \"Arrow_DIR\" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If \"Arrow\"\r\n  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been\r\n  installed.\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  build/dist/lib/cmake/ArrowPython/ArrowPythonConfig.cmake:54 (find_dependency)\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:240 (find_package)\r\n```\r\nConnected issues:\r\n - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17577\r\n - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17575",

It is tracked here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15751.\r\n\r\nThis is just my view of the topic and more ideas would be very welcome.\r\nI know that more I use the docs, less things I feel needs change =)\r\n\r\nSo any PR to make the docs better is always welcome!"

You also need to potentially remove `$ARROW_HOME/lib/cmake/Arrow*` (with `ARROW_HOME` set to `CONDA_PREFIX`) or some of the actual libraries or include files, before rebuilding Arrow C++.\r\n\r\nI think it might be useful to mention _something_ about it, but I am not sure how to do this robustly and succinctly for all platforms .."
