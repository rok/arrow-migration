Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nARROW-9206 measures average latency in flight benchmark.\r\n In practice, latency quantile is necessary to show the whole picture of rpc performance. E.g., 99% quantile, max, median.\r\n A naive approach to save latencies of all batches is not applicable. Boost accumulator_set implements p square quantile algorithm which uses O(1) space with trivial computation overhead for each batch. It can be used in calculating latency quantiles.",
