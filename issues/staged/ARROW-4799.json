Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently in the prototype work in ARROW-4782, operations are being \"boxed\" in a strongly typed Expr types. An alternative structure would be for an operation to define a virtual\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nvirtual std::shared_ptr<ArgType> out_type() const = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `ArgType` is some class that encodes the arity (array vs. scalar vs....) and value type (if any) that is emitted by the operation.\r\n\r\nOperations emitting multiple pieces of data would need some kind of \"tuple\" object output. We can iterate on this",
