Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen I run TPC-H query 12, I see that the join order is not optimized to put the smaller table on the left. I added some debug logging and see that the optimization sees row count of None on the left side because there is a filter wrapping the table scan.",
