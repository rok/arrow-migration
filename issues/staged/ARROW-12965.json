Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs mentioned in ARROW-7272 or in PR https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10201, it would be valuable to have the Arrow C data interface implemented in Java to provide better inter-process data sharing facility without depending on 3rd party serialization protocols.",

Nothing changed in the last two days :)\r\n\r\nHowever, from a testing perspective it seems like the best I can do are some roundtrip tests (like in arrow-rs).\u00a0 A separate effort for C Data Interface integration tests is needed (not just for java) to fully test such implementations. Are there any plans or a design/discussion on it?\u00a0"

In the arrow2 rust implementation a workaround is used (in the FFI code for Union an empty validity buffer is explicitly added). To me it sounds like a bug that should be resolved in arrow-cpp instead. `[~apitrou]` Should we try to workaround it in Java too or open a bug ticket?"
