        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-11606](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11606). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe have run into an issue in the Ballista project where we are reconstructing the Final and Partial HashAggregateExec operators [1] for distributed execution and we need some guidance.\r\n\r\nThe Partial HashAggregateExec gets created OK and executes correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we create the Final HashAggregateExec, it is not finding the expected schema in the input operator. The partial exec outputs field names ending with \"[sum]\" and \"[count]\" and so on but the final aggregate doesn't seem to be looking for those names.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that the Final and Partial executors are not connected directly in this usage.\r\n\r\nThe Partial exec is executed and output streamed to disk.\r\n\r\nThe Final exec then runs against the output from the Partial exec.\r\n\r\nWe may need to make changes in DataFusion to allow other crates to support this kind of use case?\r\n\r\n\u00a0[1] https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista/pull/491\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

These compiled expressions are then used to construct both the partial and final aggregates.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the expressions for the Final aggregate are not compiled against it's input schema, but against the input schema of the Partial aggregate.\r\n\r\nThis feels a little unnatural when implementing serde but I will think about this more and see how I can work around this.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0"
