The fix should be to refactor the SSE detection macro out of this file such that the needing code does not need to import this file and only a header with macro detection.",

To actually have dynamic detection, I believe, it would require to move all the code using SSE4 intrinsics into a separate translation unit that would be the only one to be compiled with -msse4.2."
