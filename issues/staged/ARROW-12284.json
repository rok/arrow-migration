        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-12284](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12284). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI am creating this issue based on the discussion at the sync call earlier today.\r\n\r\nApparently DataFusion is not only using the high-level Arrow API but is also accessing Arrow internals directly and this would be one challenge in moving to a majorly refactored Arrow implementation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we need to review what the public Arrow API should be and which APIs DataFusion should or should not be using.",
