(We use JIRA to track tickets for Arrow implementations other than R, which is why things are a little ambiguous sometimes!).\r\n\r\nWould you mind providing a ([small and reproducible](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html)) code example of what you're trying to do?\r\n\r\nI see that `first` and `last` from xts are a lot like `head()` and `tail()` which are already implemented, so we might be able to find a solution using those functions."

If you're using the release version of Arrow (9.0.0), using across() inside summarise() isn't supported yet\n1. If you're using the dev version of Arrow which does support across() inside summarise(), we don't yet have support for user-defined functions (ARROW-17366 covers lambda functions but I'll add something in now to also mention anonymous functions)\n   \n   Those things said, I wonder if we can update the error messaging here to be more descriptive."

That said, there's also no need as far as I can see, given you'd get the same result just calling `head()` outside of `summarise()` in a simple use case like the one in the reprex.\r\n\r\nAs we have head() and tail() supported, I can't see the need to also implement first() and last() as they achieve the same things.  If there are more details to this use case though that show otherwise, feel free to open a new ticket with those details."
