        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-1255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1255). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe proposal here is to check requests that are send to plasma via the flatbuffers protocol for validity using the flatbuffers verifier. For efficiency reasons this should only be done in debug builds.\n\nThis will prevent typos like https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/878 and will also prevent errors from possible future plasma clients written in different languages.",
