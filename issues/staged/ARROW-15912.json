        "title": "[C++] Is CSV reader's TimestampParser usable elsewhere?",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-15912](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15912). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe `TimestampParser` seems to be able to cycle through several formats. This sort of functionality would be very useful for some of the lubridate bindings that need to behave in a similar way. \r\n\r\n```r\n\r\nlibrary(arrow)\r\nlibrary(fs)\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nlibrary(tibble)\r\n\r\ntf <- fs::file_temp(ext = \"csv\")\r\nfs::file_create(tf)\r\n\r\nsample_times <- tibble(a = c(\"09/13/2013\", \"25/12/1998\", \"09-13-13\", \"23_Feb_2022\", \"09/13/2018\"))\r\nwrite_csv(sample_times, tf)\r\n\r\n\r\nread_csv_arrow(tf, \r\n               as_data_frame = TRUE,\r\n               timestamp_parsers = c(\"%m/%d/%Y\", \"%d/%m/%Y\", \"%m-%d-%y\", \"%d_%b_%Y\"))\r\n#> # A tibble: 5 \u00d7 1\r\n#>   a                  \r\n#>   <dttm>             \r\n#> 1 2013-09-13 01:00:00\r\n#> 2 1998-12-25 00:00:00\r\n#> 3 2013-09-13 01:00:00\r\n#> 4 2022-02-23 00:00:00\r\n#> 5 2018-09-13 01:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, in lubridate, the `ymd()` cycles through all possible formats that have year-month-date components in the right order (e.g. `\"%Y-%m-%d\", \"%y-%m-%d\", \"%Y-%b-%d\", \"%y-%b-%d\", \"%Y-%B-%d\", \"%y-%b-%d\"`, etc).   \r\n\r\nI guess my question is: Can we factor this CSV reader feature to be usable elsewhere? This was the bit that caught my attention: \"using the virtual parser interface in arrow/util/value_parsing.h\", and told me that using it elsewhere might be a possibility.  ",

You'll have to reimplement the logic to loop through parsers yourself, but that should be close to trivial.\r\n\r\nDoes this issue need to be kept open?"
