Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe don't perform enough checks on ArrayData when creating StringArray and LargeStringArray. As they use different integer sizes for offsets, this can create a problem where Offset<Vec<i32>> could be correctly reinterpreted as Offset<Vec<i64>> and vice versa.\r\n\r\nWe should add checks that pervent this. The same might apply for List and LargeList",
