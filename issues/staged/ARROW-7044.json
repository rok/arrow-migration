We're maintaining the homebrew formula (at least cpp) and running nightly crossbow on it, so when we update the upstream homebrew formula, we should be sure to include any changes from the one we maintain in `dev/tasks/`. What if (as is the case this time) there is a change in the CMake flags or dependencies? Where do you make those changes?\r\n\r\n"

It's not a fully automatic script, as it requires some manual inspection, but it is at least complete now."
