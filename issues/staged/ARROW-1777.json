Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBecause of the fickleness of `std::make_shared`, we are having to store a vector of buffers in an lvalue rather than passing the buffers in the `make_shared` function call as an initializer list. This makes things a bit awkward, and could be made possibly better with a factory function",
