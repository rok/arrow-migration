        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13389](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13389). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the `coalesce`\u00a0kernel treats\u00a0`NaN`\u00a0as a non-null value. Consider adding a boolean option to this\u00a0kernel that could be used to make it treat\u00a0`NaN`\u00a0values the same as null values.\u00a0This would allow the code added in ARROW-13201 to be much simplified.",
