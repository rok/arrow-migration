Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSince the NPM JavaScript module may wish to release more frequently than the main Arrow \"monorepo\", we should create a script to produce signed NPM artifacts to use for voting:\n\n- Update metadata for new version\n- Run unit tests\n- Create package tarballs with NPM\n- GPG sign and create md5 and sha512 checksum files\n- Upload to Apache dev SVN\n\ni.e. like https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/dev/release/02-source.sh, but only for JavaScript.\n\nWe will also want to write instructions for Arrow developers to verify the tarballs to streamline the release votes",
