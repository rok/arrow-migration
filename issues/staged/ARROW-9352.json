So I think that they aren't blocker and we can ignore them.\r\n\r\n`ubuntu-eoan-arm64`: The \"No output has been received in the last 10m0s\" error occurred sometimes. I think that `ninja` outputs something but Travis CI doesn't detect it. If we think this should be fixed for 1.0.0, we can drop support for Ubuntu Eoan because it's EOL is 2020-07.\r\n\r\n`ubuntu-focal-arm64`: The \"The job exceeded the maximum time limit for jobs\" error occurred by the base `arm64v8/ubuntu:focal` image update yesterday: https://hub.docker.com/layers/arm64v8/ubuntu/focal/images/sha256-d856f8e1bc82c4d2ea20336b14fdaf4723dafc7c2f24936026f17f315692a537\r\n\r\nIt causes re-`apt install`. It takes more time than usual.\r\n"
