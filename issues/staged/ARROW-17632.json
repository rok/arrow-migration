Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAs discussed here:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13892#discussion_r963587046>\r\n\r\nWe used to show information of where Arrow was being found during build:\r\n```java\n\r\n\u00a0 message(STATUS \"Arrow version: ${ARROW_VERSION} (${ARROW_FIND_APPROACH})\")\r\n\u00a0 message(STATUS \"Arrow SO and ABI version: ${ARROW_SO_VERSION}\")\r\n\u00a0 message(STATUS \"Arrow full SO version: ${ARROW_FULL_SO_VERSION}\")\r\n\u00a0 message(STATUS \"Found the Arrow core shared library: ${ARROW_SHARED_LIB}\")\r\n\u00a0 message(STATUS \"Found the Arrow core import library: ${ARROW_IMPORT_LIB}\")\r\n\u00a0 message(STATUS \"Found the Arrow core static library: ${ARROW_STATIC_LIB}\") \n```\r\nWe should\u00a0 add back the messages to `ArrowConfig.cmake.in.`\r\n\r\nAs proposed on the comment if we want to add `{}message(STATUS ...){`}, it's better that we check `Arrow_FIND_QUIETLY` like:\r\n```java\n\r\nif(NOT Arrow_FIND_QUIETLY)\r\n  message(STATUS ...)\r\nendif()\n```\r\n`Arrow_FIND_QUIETLY` is `TRUE` only when an user specify `QUIET` explicitly like `{}find_package(Arrow QUIET){`}.",
