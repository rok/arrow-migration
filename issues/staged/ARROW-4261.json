        "title": "[C++] CMake paths for IPC, Flight, Thrift, and Plasma don't support using Arrow as a subproject",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-4261](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-4261). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nBuilds using Arrow as a CMake subproject (using add_subdirectory) will fail if the IPC, Flight, Thrift, or Plasma features are turned on. This issue is caused by the use of CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR which point to the top level directories of the CMake project (source and output, respectively).\r\n\r\nIn most of the cases where these paths are used, they are intended to point to the Arrow source and build dirs. Defining and using CMake variables for those top level Arrow folders solves the issue.\r\n\r\nI will open a pull request to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nA project that demonstrates the issue and the patch can be found here: https://github.com/mvilim/arrow-as-subproject\r\n\r\nNote: there are several other locations in the repo where CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR are used (outside of the main cpp build, the cmake_modules, and the Gandiva subproject, for example). I hesitate to change these without an easy way to test all the possible build paths. I choosing a safe route here and changing only the most straightforward ones (and ones most likely to be used with Arrow as a subproject). If you would prefer I try to change all uses of these variables, let me know (and let me know if you have a straightforward way to test the supported build configurations).",

I'm not sure that this is a use case that we should invest too much energy in supporting. The fixes that you've posted look fine (will review further), though.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem with using `add_subdirectory` is that it pollutes the calling environment indiscriminately. Generally we'd recommend using `ExternalProject_Add` instead"

I can see the argument for using `add_subdirectory` which would import 100% of targets and variables into a CMake project. I think it's OK to have small fixes to enable that to work in some use cases, but in general that is not going to be the recommended way to include Arrow in another CMake project"
