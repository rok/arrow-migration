Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThe R package currently relies on\u00a0[vctrs](https://github.com/r-lib/vctrs[),|https://github.com/r-lib/vctrs]\u00a0a project that as of now is not on CRAN or any other major package repository.\r\n\r\nThis is not mentioned in the installation instructions\u00a0or anywhere else. Developers who do not already have\u00a0**vctrs** (an experimental package) will get an error complaining about its absence when they try to install the arrow R package.\r\n\r\nI recommend explicitly adding install instructions for it to the README for the R package.",
