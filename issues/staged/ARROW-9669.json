Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be really great to support [S3 Access Points](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/access-points/) and not only objects in the form \"bucket/key\". This is a simply level of abstraction over an S3 bucket which should be quite easy to implement and was added last September.",

The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using Access Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide_.\r\n\r\nRequired: Yes"

I tried looking at the C++ implementation but am unsure if it is just taking the bucket from \"bucket/key\" and passing that as the hostname to a REST GET request to S3. If it is, it should be fine but my initial tests with just replacing the ARN didn't work. The default hostname is Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com whereas with access point it is _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com"

This is implemented in boto3 and the regex to match the access points are already there."
