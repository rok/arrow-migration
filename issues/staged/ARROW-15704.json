Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/3a8e409385c8455e6c80b867c5730965a501d113/cpp/cmake_modules/Findjemalloc.cmake#L68>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt seems that Findjemalloc.cmake think it has found jemalloc only if there exists shared library. It would be nice if Findjemalloc can statically link with libjemalloc.a",
