Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nI have a Nvidia GPU without cuda, everytime I run the verification scripts it borks in the middle because ARROW_HAVE_CUDA is evaluated to yes because `nvidia-smi --list-gpus` returns true. This can be a long process if I forget about it.\r\n\r\nWould it be better to check for `CUDA_HOME`?",
