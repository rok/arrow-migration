Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWe found that the integer range check when generating integration data doesn't work in Windows because the default C integers that numpy uses are 32-bit by default in Windows.\r\n\r\nThis fixes that issue by forcing 64-bit integers.",
