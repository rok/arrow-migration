        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-13103](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13103). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nFunctions `[pyarrow.compute.dictionary_encode()|https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.compute.dictionary_encode.html]` and `[pyarrow.Array.dictionary_encode()|https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.DictionaryArray.html#pyarrow.DictionaryArray.dictionary_encode]` don't allow to specify a desirable dictionary type.\r\n\r\nA dictionary type consists of value type, index type, and ordering.\r\n Index type is set to `int32()` and ordering is set to `False`.\r\n\r\nChanging these properties requires redundant casting ([not implemented](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13102)).",
