Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nSee the output of the nightly builds: https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/4101736097?check_suite_focus=true (it might also be numpy that fails installing, but since that's a build requirement this thus also fails installing pyarrow's sdist)\r\n\r\nUpstream issue: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2849 (we see the same error `AttributeError: get_data_files_without_manifest`)",
