Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt's getting harder and harder to install Java7 these days. On a new install of Ubuntu 16.04 I am not even sure how to get Oracle's Java7 installed (though Java8 can be installed through a PPA).\r\n\r\nIn lieu of fixing all the javadoc problems, it would be great if there was some other workaround to build the release on Java8",
