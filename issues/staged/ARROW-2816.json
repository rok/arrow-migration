        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-2816](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-2816). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCopied from https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/2114\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\nCurrently, NativeFile does not pass the check of pandas for being a \"file-like\" object because it does not have __iter__ method. It can be easily added using code from native python io module as a reference. Another way would be to subclass io.IOBase.\r\n\r\nThe exact code of pandas check can be found here.\r\n\r\nCode for __iter__ method and io.IOBase can be found here.\r\n```",

I maybe missunderstand\u00a0[the docs](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html#subclassing)\u00a0but I think you can only inherit from other extension (i.e. Cython) classes or built-in types. At least I couldn't get it working. The other way around works fine, of course."

It could be possible to solve that by using composition: have a `cdef` class that contains the actual file handle, and then a regular class inheriting from `RawIOBase` that delegates to methods of the `cdef` class.\r\n\r\nOtherwise we can just implement `__iter__`  and `__next__`."

Since RawIOBase is an ABC, couldn't we just register NativeFile with it, after we've added all the methods? Should take care of any instanceof checks."
