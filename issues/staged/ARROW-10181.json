Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nRaspberry Pi still tends to use 32-bit operating systems although there is a beta 64 bit version of Raspbian. It would be nice to be able to at least disable these tests when runnign on 32-bit. \r\n```java\n\r\nerror: literal out of range for `usize`\r\n   --> arrow/src/util/bit_util.rs:421:25\r\n    |\r\n421 |         assert_eq!(ceil(10000000000, 10), 1000000000);\r\n    |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n    |\r\n    = note: `#[deny(overflowing_literals)]` on by default\r\n    = note: the literal `10000000000` does not fit into the type `usize` whose range is `0..=4294967295`error: literal out of range for `usize`\r\n   --> arrow/src/util/bit_util.rs:422:29\r\n    |\r\n422 |         assert_eq!(ceil(10, 10000000000), 1);\r\n    |                             ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n    |\r\n    = note: the literal `10000000000` does not fit into the type `usize` whose range is `0..=4294967295`error: literal out of range for `usize`\r\n   --> arrow/src/util/bit_util.rs:423:25\r\n    |\r\n423 |         assert_eq!(ceil(10000000000, 1000000000), 10);\r\n    |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n    |\r\n    = note: the literal `10000000000` does not fit into the type `usize` whose range is `0..=4294967295`\r\n \n```",
