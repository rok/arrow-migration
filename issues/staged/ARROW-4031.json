Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be useful to have a specialization of TypedBufferBuilder to simplify building buffers of bits. This could then be utilized by ArrayBuilder (for the null bitmap) and BooleanBuilder (for values)",
