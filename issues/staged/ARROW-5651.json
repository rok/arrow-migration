        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-5651](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5651). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIn the example below the PyArrow array gives wrong results for strided numpy arrays when the type is different from the initial Numpy type:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>> import numpy as np\r\n>> np_array = np.arange(0, 10, dtype=np.float32)[1:-1:2]\r\n>> pa.array(np_array, type=pa.float64())\r\n<pyarrow.lib.DoubleArray object at 0x7f8453de8138>\r\n[\r\n  1,\r\n  2,\r\n  3,\r\n  4\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen copying the Numpy array to a new location is gives the expected output:\r\n\r\n```Java\n\r\n>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>> import numpy as np\r\n>> np_array = np.array(np.arange(0, 10, dtype=np.float32)[1:-1:2])\r\n>> pa.array(np_array, type=pa.float64())\r\n<pyarrow.lib.DoubleArray object at 0x7f5a0af0a4a8>                                                                           [    \r\n 1,\r\n 3,\r\n 5,\r\n 7 \r\n]  \r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at the [code](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/7a5562174cffb21b16f990f64d114c1a94a30556/cpp/src/arrow/python/numpy_to_arrow.cc#L407) it seems that to determine the number of elements, the target type is used instead of the initial numpy type.\r\n\r\nIn this case the stride is 8 bytes which corresponds to 2 elements in float32 whereas the codes tries to determine the number of elements with the target type which gives 1 element of float64 and therefore it reads the array one by one instead of every 2 elements until reaching the total number of elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
