        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-14665](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14665). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen specifying a target batch size, the [iteration logic](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/ea42b9e0aa000238fff22fd48f06f3aa516b9f3f/java/adapter/jdbc/src/main/java/org/apache/arrow/adapter/jdbc/JdbcToArrowUtils.java#L266) is currently broken:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\n\r\n        while (rs.next() && readRowCount < config.getTargetBatchSize()) {\r\n          compositeConsumer.consume(rs);\r\n          readRowCount++;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ncalling next() on the result set will move the cursor forward to the next row, even when we've reached the target batch size.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider setting target batch size to 1, and query a table that has three rows.\r\n\r\nOn the first iteration, we'll successfully consume the first row. On the next iteration, we'll move the cursor to row 2, but detect the read row count is no longer < target batch size and return.\r\n\r\nUpon calling into the method again with the same result set, rs.next will be called again which will result in successfully consuming row 3.\r\n\r\n**Problem:** row 2 is skipped!
