Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen passing a PEP519-compliant object (e.g. an fsspec OpenFile object) which implements an `__fspath__` method to `pyarrow.parquet.read_table()`, the object is converted into an invalid string by simply calling the `str` method, rather than stringifying the output of the `__fspath__` method.\u00a0",
