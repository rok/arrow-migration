Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nCurrently the Substrait consumer only accepts URIs that use the `file` scheme.  We should add support for URI schemes that we support (`s3`, `gcfs`) similar to the way pyarrow can create filesystems from URIs.",
