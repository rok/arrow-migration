        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-16660](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16660). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nC# Implementation does not support reading/writing Time32Array and Time64Array which makes it unusable to read/write Arrow batches containing these array types.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs the native TimeSpan class in C# only supports resolution in milliseconds, it cannot be used to implement both these types of arrays in a consistent manner. These arrays can, however be supported as simple Int32/ Int64 arrays which represent seconds/ milliseconds/ microseconds/ nanoseconds passed since midnight which the user should parse as needed.\u00a0",
