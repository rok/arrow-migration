Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nAmong the things I noticed recently that should be easy to clean up:\r\n \\* We should supply a favicon\r\n \\* The <title> is the same for every page and it always says \"Apache Arrow Homepage\"\r\n \\* There are no opengraph or twitter card meta tags, so there's no link preview\r\n \\* The version of bootstrap used is not current and has been flagged as a possible security vulnerability\r\n\r\nMuch of this could just be fixed by porting to a modern Hugo template, which I'll explore.",
