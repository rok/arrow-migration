Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nThis needs to be broken down into smaller tasks\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nThere are ~32 uses of unsafe insrc/array/\\*.rs and we should document them according to the guidelines in the Arrow crate README\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n```java\n\r\n// JUSTIFICATION\r\n//  Benefit\r\n//      Describe the benefit of using unsafe. E.g.\r\n//      \"30% performance degradation if the safe counterpart is used, see bench X.\"\r\n//  Soundness\r\n//      Describe why the code remains sound (according to the definition of rust's unsafe code guidelines). E.g.\r\n//      \"We bounded check these values at initialization and the array is immutable.\"\r\nlet ... = unsafe { ... }; \n```",
