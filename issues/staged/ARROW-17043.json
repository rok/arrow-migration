Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\n`date64 + intX` would be equivalent to `date64 + intX->cast(duration(unit = \"d\"))` (I guess this is tricky since \"s\" is the largest duration unit? but date64 is an integer underneath, we should be able to add another integer to it)\r\n`timestamp[ms] + intX` would be equivalent to `timestamp[ms] + intX->cast(timestamp(unit = \"ms\"))`\r\netc.\r\n\r\nMultiplication and division probably don't make sense, but addition and subtraction do, at least saves you the trouble of having to convert to a Duration first.",
