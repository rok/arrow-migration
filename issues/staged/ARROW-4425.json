Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nIt would be nice to link to the [\"Contributing to Apache Arrow\"](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW/Contributing+to+Apache+Arrow)\u00a0~~Confluence\u00a0page~~(\\*EDIT) in the\u00a0Sphinx\u00a0docs directly from the main project [README](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/README.md)\u00a0(in the already existing \"Getting involved\" section) because it's a\u00a0bit hard to find right now.\r\n\r\n\"contributing\" page:\u00a0<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ARROW/Contributing+to+Apache+Arrow>\r\n\r\nmain project README:\u00a0<https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/README.md>\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEDIT: Moving the \"Contributing\" wiki to a page in the actual [Arrow Sphinx docs (location in repo)](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/docs) would\u00a0also make it easier to find and modify. An additional task, ARROW-4427\u00a0 was added to do this.",
