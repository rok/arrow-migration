        "title": "[Python] Unable to catch Spark Python UDF exceptions",
        "body": "***Note**: This issue was originally created as [ARROW-6382](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6382). Please see the [migration documentation](https://gist.github.com/toddfarmer/12aa88361532d21902818a6044fda4c3) for further details.*\n\n### Original Issue Description:\nWhen PyArrow is enabled, Pandas UDF exceptions raised by the Executor become impossible to catch: see example below. Is this expected behavior?\r\n\r\nIf so, what is the rationale. If not, how do I fix this?\r\n\r\nConfirmed behavior in PyArrow 0.11 and 0.14.1 (latest) and PySpark 2.4.0 and 2.4.3. Python 3.6.5.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n```java\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n# setting this to false will allow the exception to be caught\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled\", \"true\")\r\n\r\n@udfdef disrupt:\r\n    raise Exception(\"Test EXCEPTION\")\r\n\r\ndata = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 2, 3]}))\r\ntry: \r\n    test = data.withColumn(\"test\", disrupt(\"A\")).toPandas()\r\nexcept:\r\n    print(\"exception caught\")\r\n\r\nprint('end')\n```\r\nI would hope there's a way to catch the exception with the general except clause.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
